This was a great watch.
"Just a question how to we Insert Host Rna do we use Cas9 protein ?  


Also Second question how do add  host rna to DNA in the first place rna has ribose while DNA has Deoxyribose also rna has Uracil as its nitrogenous base instead of Thymine ?"
Thank you good sir.. this really helped me for my presentation
"Filling the gap
No evidence showed regarding any allegation
Stop misleading people"
I watched half a dozen videos so far on CRISPR and this video helped me piece everything together with enough details. Thank you very much
AWESOME VIDEOOOOOOO!!!! LOVED IT
I guess it could be used for bad ( weapons) and good ( healing).

I hate science
Love  this video! Very handsome
They transformed it into a weaponized version eugenics and specifically to create altered versions of plagues in undesirable populations. Hope they don‚Äôt use it.

god I love you
Great video!‚ù§
Wow
üòÖüòÖ
I always come back to this video when I need a refresher on CRISPR. This video has it all. Thank you!
Thank you for the discussion.
Your videos have helped me in every major step in my academic career. I am a 1st year medical student and still come back to your videos for help. Thank you so much for all that you do!
Can someone tell me how this is done though? Like is a machine used?
Not very clear.
CRISPER IS A LIVING BEING
Blestematilor .. focul lui Putin o sa va arda .nimic nu o sa ramana din dracoveniile voastre spurcate ..
Thank you
"8 years later your videos continue saving lives and degrees. Incredible explanations! Please, for the love of god and the hope of future generations, never take down your posts!!"
"Great explanation, highly appreciated <3"
"Good job but i think have a mistake 

In any given bacterial strain, a CRISPR sequence inserted during the oldest infection is located farthest from the cas genes and the most recent is closest to the cas genes."
Thanks a lot after 8 years wow=)
Basically what it is is x men technology there is a price that comes with playing God. A half life
Cambridge AS and A level biology writers should come and have lecture from you and then rewrite the book
very good explanation! thank you sir.
THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!! loved every second of this
brilliant simple explanation
Am I allowed to invite you to my college graduation?
Have you guys heard about mitochondria ? Hint- its the Powerhouse of the cell
Genetics is insane‚Ä¶ dystopian future incoming
thank you that was very helpful!!!
CRISPR has made its way to the general public in the form of a Sickle Cell treatment. Limited trials i believe.
Stumbled across it during my breakfast and such a wonderful video it is. The concept is explained very lucidily.
How come it's RNA binding to DNA ... Shouldn't it be DNA too to bind to bacteriophage DNA
"GRACIAS, ni un solo video con el que pudiese entenderlo y ahora me ha quedado clar√≠simo ü´∂üèª"
super helpful!!
it was helpful:)
"How would you target all of the cells?
Otherwise the gene we want to be silenced would only be removed from the cells we have targeted."
"I'm not sure I'm 100% on exactly how it works, but you did a beautiful job of explaining the base concepts to a relatively unscientific shlub like me. Thanks!"
This will inevitably lead to people getting cancer from using this via gene mutations. As if the radiation from CT scanners and adjuvants from the shots are not enough. Just more customers for the allopathic medicine industry
"Ahh,, ya. 
I totally get it now.
Thanks for the simple explanation.
So much clearer on that now."
"My teacher adviced my entire class to watch this video for a better understanding, and now I can see why. You just saved my essay man, thank you!"

Amazing ü§©
Soooo helpful thank you!
"As a biology student, this helped me so much. Amazing video!"
Hey I have a question (I hope you are still reading and replying to comments) - how do you  cure a disease whose gene is in every cell of the body? How do you replace and insert a new gene replacing the old one which was causing the disease in ALL the cells in the body
"Many have played Jenga or know the basics of displacement.
Before humans have a complete understanding of genetics and a true explanation for "" junk DNA"".
In my opinion, sciences ( generic) are run like a business and may theories are lacking in research, application and the red tape is snipped prematurely to hasten a contract or deal . Scary shit."
"this was honestly very beautiful , ill need to rewatch it tho"
Great lecture and simplicity  explained üëå üéâüéâüòä thanks
"I typically never leave comments on videos, but you really taught me an entire lecture and lecture video  that my teracher assigned. She's not a bad teacher i actually like her, but somehow not everything gets through. I was so shaky on the concept or the crispr system and didn't know what was what. Now i feel as though i have some illegal knowledge that the government will try to take me in for at some point in my life."
Thanks!
loved it

"As a first year med student, THANK YOU!"
"I have grade 10 biology education (though fairly smart). I've taken an interest in this thing and genetic modifications in general. This was very easy to follow. Can anyone recommend a more advanced thing though that goes over WHY it's cutting those genes (all the details - chemicals etc.), and more in detail about adding the new DNA?"

"I really liked your video, I am an educator - teaching medical residents and students. Can you please share how you create animations for your videos. Thanks in advance. Dr Arora"
Thanks for sharing this! it was awesome ;)
"Thanks Mr Bozeman. Great explanation! I do have a question. If you want to heal a patient with a genetic disease, does the crispr-cas9 corrects one cell or all the cells? If it only heal one cell, how does the healed cell overcome other original cells?"
that was fantastic to summarize it in a very short time. thanks

Is it host DNA or RNA that is incorporated when inserting a gene? I believe both were said
"Well, this is really helpful. Thank you so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è"

thank you! finally got it
thank you it is a life saver. I have an exam tomorrow
Is it really possible to reprogram dna in adults or is it only possible in embryo?
"No no no, if you think it'll only be used fir good your so wrong. Greed money and power . This is horrific"
Perfect!
"""Shut up and give me wolf ears!"""
Could this help ALS?
"I wonder for the modified CRISPR, when do the cutting of the original double stranded DNA, where did the original gene sequence go? Because it seem like the enzyme only cleave the DNA at specific location and not remove the desired gene that we want to replace"

"Preparing for my med-sku interview tomorrow, I hope they'll ask me something about this so I could show off as a 17 year old. Lord bless me."
that is amazing yet terrifying. Genetically Modified Humans! Could someone inject me with a virus¬†and have the crisper process started without my knowledge?
That was very Interesting Thanks Paul Never thought i would have Understood or watched it till the end Thanks.
"You did a great job with this video, so much so that a layperson could grasp it. Thank you. Please do one on Oligodendroglioma brain tumors!"
4:55 5:13
Is the third part just an engineered linear strand? Or is that a plasmid? So do scientists put in both CRSPR and a linear DNA to gene edit a cell?
I'm not an English speaker and I understood this video. Thank you very much for the explanation. It's very visual and that had helped me a lot. For more teachers like this guy :)
"Crisper will introduce something we don't want.   Sorry.   The introduction of what we have been seeing over the last 2 years is an attempt to control society on a grand scale. The individuals that are supposedly controlling everything that happens have a plan to regulate everything.  Mostly, how we function daily. Period.  
How?
Well, something has been introduced into us that we ran to recently because of a scare.  Ask yourself what was it?  Well, it shut down everything under the guise of health emergency people.  Why did they do this?  To control:
Population.
Banking
Health
Policing.  and even worship.
It will even recognize YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!! 
Remember the Tom Cruise movie?  Minority Report?  
China has already pushed forward with the credit system that recognizes you at a drop of a hat!
DNA manipulation will be introduced into the human body from the next level of digital I.D.  this I.D. will recognize you!!!!
Anytime ""THEY"" want!!

Yea.
Good Idea! 
Read your bible!!!"
Thank you so much! That was super helpful!!!!
Can you invest in a company working on this?
"Great, you have an amazing faculty to diseminate science. Congratulations"
The road to hell is paved with good intentions

totally helpful
Does tracrRNA have any function other than to hold stuff in place?
"I went over the CRISPR system today with my students, had them model it with the Bio-Rad paper model, now I'm going to make an Ed-Puzzle using this video as formative before we actually do a CRISPR experiment in class (lacZ gene knockout). Thank you for this in depth video on CRISPR!"

Awesome video! Thanks for making it.
GOOD!!
What part of it changes you do you not understand
Now i could understand! Thank you <3
Tried explaining this in my podcast where I go over CRISPR technology but you explained this perfectly thank you!
Nice Many Thanks
Thank you
Cool video! Thanks :)
super helpful

"The mad scientist really opened Pandor's Box with this one.  Rewriting millions of years of evolution cannot  be good.  This technology should have been top secret.  These individuals were more interested in fame and furtune then the impact it will have on the world üåé   China is now utilizing this technology.  They recently built concentrations camps, could be bio-laboratories.  Humans are not yet wise enough to wield such power.  We're not going to make it, too many wrong turns."
Awsome Video! Thanks for the effort! Much appreicated and so helpful!
how can I grow taller or cure hair loss from this? I ready to take the risks.
"Wow soo this is CRISPR...
Makes sense to make a fuss for it cause it really has a potential. 
But if it starts being used to make modified humans like super soliders... woooah it could be devastating"
Whats this tech used for now?

Great video!
"As far as I know the CRISPR virus causes a fever which has killed a lot of people and is the major risk factor. Immunotherapy has that risk but I hope they are really working to counter that as it a good way to remove genetic diseases from the dna of cells or repair cancerous cells and will be a good tool to help people survive. Until a machine can exist that can program dna externally and destroy cells which is far away, using some kind of qauntum non destructive computer controlled radiation streams."
I love your videos!! you should do reviews for MCAT material!
"I watched this for my school activity and I have to rewatch it over and over to understand since I'm very slow. But it is TOTALLY HELPFUL, with all the illustrations and the explanations. Thank you!"

"Hi sir, please make a video on PAM"
I wonder if celebs and the ultra wealthy are already using this technology to create designer babies
I've seen the real thing done in a lab.  Anyone with 5 minutes of training can do it.  It's in silica.  So if you like to spin cells add a caustic element run a PCR amplification and then in silica show the procedure done go for it.  But it amounts to nothing.  It's literally imaginary.  Go ahead and be amazed by explanations and animations but watch it done in the lab.  And tell me you believe it after that.  It's nothing.
Dude. You look tired. I ªd be too if I was teaching the whole freaking world.
I though CRISPR was the technology that makes illigal Aliens US Citizens without all the Bureaucratic Red Tape??
"In response to ""was it helpful?"", well I'm using this video to prepare my A levels biology lecture."
"This is how the Human race will destroy itself. My generation thought it would be physics. Now we know it will be molecular biology. We have seen the face of evil.  Unfortunately, the fools writing comments will be in control of regulating this monster. As you can see, they are utterly clueless."

MONSTER
wow. You were right. Most of the other videos were too simple. This was perfectly explained
"I have been reading and reading about this but I have a question that I simply cannot find the answer to: When editing a developed organism, what is the vehicle for SPREADING this change throughout?  Every lecture and article tells me what happens in a single cell, but how does this change then spread? Do we just need to inject a large amount of the gRNA and Cas9 at once? Or is there a way to make a small change spread to other cells, like a virus.  If anyone knows, please answer.  I'm a sci-fi writer and I'm trying to get to the bottom of this to accurately represent a hypothetical situation in my plot."
"wow!!! I sure need to review the normal DNA before understanding this!!! Very complex!
Sounds very interesting"

"Esto no es una verdadera emergencia sanitaria, es una dictadura mundial. Esta es la Tercera Guerra Mundial... pero a√∫n no se ha declarado abiertamente. Los que no est√°n despiertos tienen pocas posibilidades de sobrevivir.

Quienes dominan este mundo quieren tratarnos como terminales de computadora, quieren instalarnos un software y dejar que un algoritmo decida por nosotros. Es el fin de la era humana, o eso creen quienes nos dominan, porque ellos quieren que seamos transhumanos... Y sin derecho a elegir lo que se hace con nuestros propios cuerpos.

Las vacunas modifican el ADN, eso est√° fuera de discusi√≥n. Un cuerpo humano normal no puede producir la prote√≠na espiga... El ARN mensajero es lo que le ense√±a a nuestro cuerpo a producir esta prote√≠na sint√©tica. El ADN natural no modificado no se puede patentar, porque es un producto de la naturaleza, pero si aceptaste esta vacuna, entonces tu ADN ya est√° modificado y ya est√°s patentado. 

Eres transhumano. Los transhumanos perder√°n todos sus derechos, porque ya no ser√°n considerados humanos. Los derechos humanos no los proteger√°n. Antes de que te enfades con quien te dice la verdad, investiga... Y si ya est√°s despierto, entonces te felicito. De cualquier manera, Dios los bendiga a todos, de todos modos. Les deseo lo mejor."

"1. Use your negetiv emotions to achieve your goals.
2. You must have control over your life.
3. Stop focus on big goals instead  of progress.

"I just want to say, that, as a millennial, the question ""Do I donate my life savings to charity?"" is maybe the least relatable question I've ever heard in my entire life."
"I've always been a drifter all my life, no more."
"Sadly, I feel Dr. Chang lacked compassion for her younger self. Choosing to become a lawyer reflected her value for security at the time, and it didn't mean she was a drifter. Her change in circumstances may have altered her perspective, but it doesn't invalidate her past choices, which were also made with autonomy. Perhaps her success as a philosopher made it harder for her to empathise with her younger, more vulnerable self.
It's important to remember that not everyone has the same privilege to follow their dreams."
"""when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that. we wholeheartedly become the people that we are"" But what are the bases for creating reasons to become a banker rather than to become an artist, say? Don't I need to know myself, know my values? If there is a better or worse or equally good answer to this question about who I am or what my values are, then isn't it not a hard choice anymore? (And if this is a wrong question to ask since there is no ""self"" and we can create ourselves ex nihilo, then there is nothing wrong with being a drifter.) Perhaps what defines hard choices is not that the options are on a par, but that the yardstick to compare the options is unclear - the person does not know herself or her values (well enough)."
"Your effort and dedication can make any decision work out. I tell myself that there is no wrong decision‚ÄîI have the power to make it the right one. I can create a successful and happy path, no matter which choice I make."
"You don't ""create"" reasons, sorry Post Modernism. Reasons exist and you choose which to focus on and follow. I choose not to get diabetes from my breakfast vs to feel good in the moment. You can measure those results scientifically with health and longevity markers like nutrition content & their functions in the body vs dopamine markers or inflammation. Those reasons are both based on objective reality, that exists (thanks, Enlightenment! <3) But my subjectivity and free will is in how I craft and navigate my life and responses, in relation to reality and my own sense of self, values, dreams, etc. Pretending that we ""create"" rather than recognize the reasons ourselves is not only delusional but quite narcissistic. Living from a place of delusion is a kind of slavery as well, especially because it creates all sorts of unnecessary discord and confusion as regards our wellbeing and society."

The advice to follow your passion is stupid.
It‚Äôs not ¬´¬†what‚Äôs the best choice for me ?¬†¬ª we should ask to ourselves but ¬´¬†what I will become with this choice ?¬†¬ª
Como consigo acha em portugu√™s?
"My best interpretation of the talk:

You have to decide what values are more important for you, what you are going to value. You create value in the process of making such choices. Think of a baby/kid that makes certain choices about hobbies, food. He/she creates reasons in the process of making a choice. We will not tell our kid that he/she should do the hobby/study that best fits his/her values, we will motivate him/her to make a choice and see that choice as a step in becoming a person. Same for adults. So it's not so much about discovering reasons/which are the best reasons but rather creating reasons. in making a choice, you rather create reasons (or value) than passively discover and follow existing reasons (related to values). When reason tells you that both options are equally valuable, accept that both options are fine, use your intuition or feeling to decide which is really ok (or flip a coin if you want, whatever you want), and stop thinking about discovering reasons but focus on valuing/being attached to your choice.

does this make sense?"
Great perspective!  I really appreciated this.  I totally agree that hard choices forge our agency and individuality.  This is what philosophy is about üëäüèª
I thought this was brilliant. The premise as I took it is that decisions should be based on personal values and be more about the kind of person you want to become vs. an optimal solution. The problem I still have is what if you have to juxoppose two mutually exclusive values when you want to embody both. That is difficult but then again this is where she is talking about having to define yourself one way or the other.
"Wow, thanks, I'm still indecisive but smarter üòÇ"
Gave me anxiety to hear to her blurb about only problems of hard choices for 5 straight minutes!
Liar

Waow I don't know what do say.This monologue made me speechless.I've been trying to decide about my Erasmus program during last few weeks.And this speech made me feel in control and helped me a lot.Thanks to Ruth Chang :)
"Hard-choice is still just a choice. It's only hard to choose if we don't know the end goal, who we are, or where we are supposed to be. 

But if you already know, it'll be easy, cause if it's still going there anyway any option is fine.
Maybe pick the one that's faster, or slower, closer or further, depending on our own taste which comes from how we define ourselves. 

You might like it slow and enjoy the process or fast and just get to the end point.
It's all up to you and your definition.

Just don't forget to celebrate options, choices and variety. They are simply an existence of an opportunity to define who we are."

Hard choices are that‚Äôs way hard because we made it hard in our mind and we don‚Äôt want to take risks and instead of what we want and to be‚Ä¶
AWESOME
Its nice to see Esther Perel as one of the audience in this very meaningful talk

"It's not that there is no best choice among multiple options; it‚Äôs that we are incapable of ever knowing which choice it is. 

Perhaps God does.

The stumbling block for us is our belief that we can ever know which was which. All that we can know is whether our choice worked out well for us or not. But we can never know it was the better or worse choice.

Like in the parable of the Chinese farmer and his son. Wherein every day something happens to the farmer and his son and every day his neighbors come and pronounce judgment on the event. ""Too Bad,‚Äù they say one day about one event. Then,  ‚ÄúHow lucky you are,"" the next day about a different event. After each pronouncement the farmer ambivalently replies, ‚ÄúWe'll see."" With each new day revealing the neighbors' judgments, no matter what they were, were wrong."
Who to merry? that's everyday a big one for me ;)
"‚Äì it‚Äôs a mistake to think that in hard choices one alternative is better than the other 
‚Äì we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world, but the world of VALUE is different from the world of SCIENCE. So there is no reason to believe that in choice there are only three possibilities: one is better, worse or equal to the other.
‚Äì hard choices -> alternatives are ‚Äòon a par‚Äô, in the same league of value, that‚Äôs why the choice is hard
‚Äì each of us has the power to create reason
‚Äì in a world where there is a ‚Äòbest‚Äô option, we‚Äôre slaves to reasons
‚Äì when we create reasons for ourselves rather than reasons given to us we wholeheartedly become the people we are
‚Äì instead of looking for reasons out there we should look for reasons within. Who am I to be? 
‚Äì looking at it this way hard choices are not a curse but a godsend"

yeah i understand this is what it means i have either the choice to stay a droppout or to do something great with my life i mean i already made 3 bad choices and ect.  one promiscousness second dropout of gary the third one is not really a bad choice is more on deciding what i want to do... rn i am a custodian n ect...my option is what til i get approval or denial on disability or go back to ged

"Sometimes might go with a choice that is indirectly better for mankind or for the world, or whether a choice can be backed out/ reversible (which allows me to drift to another choice if need be).."
"This is it guys, today's the day."
"Thank you so much! I am facing a hard choice, whether to age in place, or move to a retirement community. These are choices that, for me, seem very much on par. Now I see this as a choice of the person I want to grow into. I think I know now which choice I will make."
Good talk!
"You cannot talk about choices w/out considering if you have enough money. Yes, if you don't have enough money, you don't get to make the best choice for yourself."
"great ideas, great video. Thank you!"
"If the person I want to be, can be potentially found in both options - then the question is, which of those options get's you there in an easier/better way ? Then it comes back to comparing both options logically .. ;)"

"I watched this video 9 years ago when I was a college student, and until now it's still eye-opening for me. It reminds me that a hard choice is not a challenge to hinder us, it is a chance to define who we are. We have control over it, rather than let it control our decisions."
"Ma'am, Will you please help me get a clarity on the difference between the 'same league of value' & ' different kind of value' with an example?"

Probably one of the best/most influential Ted talks I have ever listened to.
Thank you for giving me the answer of what I already knew I should persue!
"THESE are the DEFINING MOMENTS in our Lives!

Instinctively, we know it, but it's the fear from the evil one that  holds us back in these most important, rarest, most momentous instances in our lives!

We either TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH for WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, which is UNDERPINNED by our Hod-Hiven Talents we are REQUIRED BY HIM TO MULTIPLY, and ENTER INTO OUR DESTINY, awaiting us

RIGHT HERE & RIGHT NOW at THIS VERY CROSSROAD. . . .

or COP OUT, and live a LIFE OF MEDIOCRITY, 

where we are SURE TO BE  SECURE..... 

but NEVER  FULFILLED

For we have in this Very Moment CHOSEN to BURY OUR TALENTS

- AND DID!

+Q-S/"
This insight upends the conventional view of decision-making as a stressful task. Chang eloquently communicated that these choices are not just about selecting between options but also defining who we are as individuals. These decision-making moments are indeed opportunities to manifest our values. It's a beautiful sentiment and a mindset I'll carry into future decisions.
"This was really helpful. I've been battling between a really tough choice for the past two months, and pros/cons and over analysis have not helped. This has."
"Creo que la decisi√≥n m√°s dif√≠cil para la mayor√≠a es dejar de hacer estupideces, siempre eligen hacer estupideces ""s√≥lo una vez m√°s"""
"Oh my god this video helped me so much, I cried, this is so what I needed. THANK YOU"
"All things being equal this talk makes a lot of sense. However what is not mentioned here is first you must survive and to do that you need income. We are faced with the obligation to do whatever work we can obtain to put food in our stomachs. While remembering that we do not live to put food in our stomachs we live to put nourishment into our souls. Do what you have to do but be focused on being who you are. Becoming who you are is what we live for. But we get caught up don't we. We start identifying with our menial work and we start believing that is all we are. Which is not so! Suppose I want to be a yacht builder but I have no skills to build. I must eat. So I take a job that I can do to get food and I use the rest of my time working on becoming a yacht builder. This is the way. But maybe not... Perhaps I should become a yacht builder today and hope that the journey will bear fruit along the way, enough to keep me supported. At the core of this, use these things to sharpen your mind."
"Very powerful and life changing advice that I am going to stick to (or rather have already stuck to but never knew the right words for it) -  ‚ÄúReflect on what you can put your agency behind, in what you can be for, and through Hard choices, become that person‚Äù. Thanks for this amazing message and tech talk üôèüòä"
Was that woman in the audience in 12:20 Esther Perez?.
Brilliant!
So the next question is how do I align my behavior with my values? That can be difficult with thoughts and emotions....
"I am putting my agency first! I am for this, I am for that! 
Thank you! It‚Äôs clear now!!! For the past 30 years I have the traditional methods, not paying attention for what I am for.."

but what about when all your choices seem like bad options
Wow such a God sent ! This is the best speech on this topic I have ever heard this helped me to really decide and process hard decision I have been battling . Thank You !
it's 2023 and still no Netflix DvD with our lives in each choice
"I loved the fact she mentioned how we have started evaluating life decisions according to scientific thinking. That's a real eye-opener. Decisions of life are not like length or mass that are measurable as less, more or equal. We may equate it with money but still the choices are still abstract, that's why they're hard. Simply put, hard choices are meant for you to choose what kind of life you want to ""create"""
She is a grwat philosopher
i love it
"Interesting approach. I can't agree, however. I feel like the message is to just make up whatever you want in order to justify a hard choice. This might be okay for a choice that affects only you, but do we want to empower our leaders to operate this way. I don't. Choices that are hard are not incomparable.  They are hard because there are either competing objectives at play, uncertainty in the consequences or outcomes of each possible alternative, or a struggle between the trade-offs that would result from the choice. You can compare them using multiple objective analyses which are designed to address this very difficulty of bringing competing values into the decision. While there may not be a ""best"" choice in a traditional sense, there most certainly is an ""optimal"" choice if you work hard at defining all of the different fundamental objectives underlying the decision as step 1 (even and especially those objectives that compete with one another) rather than just calling the decision hard and leaving it at that.  Being an artist might be better on life fulfillment and worse on financial stability, but how we value life fulfillment in comparison to financial stability and our risk tolerance come into play to help show that one choice really is optimal over another, depending on how these values are held by the decision-maker."
"""Far from being sources of agony and dread, hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition, that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out. And it is in the space of hard choices that we create reasons for ourselves to become the people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse, but a godsend."""
The best 15 minutes I spent this week.
Yeah Coin Flip will do
"I can cope with most of the hard choices, except being married or not married. I love someone and I spent a lot of years with her. She wants to get married now, but sometimes I think that she is not the right person, and sometimes I think that she is the best person for getting married. Also, both of our time is very limited for that decision due to some career reasons. I fear that my decisions will become my mistakes one day in the future in retrospect. Also, I think about her life with big mercy. Like, what will she do after me, could she get married(because of some old memories)? On the other hand, I sometimes feel bad about her personal attitude as she fights a lot and makes things big. Therefore, I think getting married to her can be a disaster. 

It is the hardest choice in my life...  How can I overcome this?"
Mr. Nobody
"Finally, I can make hard choices easily. This video is gem."
I love that she applies math to decision making üòä
Might be like the 10th time I find myself watching this.
"Love the talk, years later for a re-watch. I agree, either unknowingly or instinctively I made choices that aligned with my values. I write down my values and review them to see if my path is still true. ¬†Extrinsic vs intrinsic rewards can cloud the way but I realized I am most content when I choose which best aligns with my values.   
Years ago, with math and economics degree I had the opportunity to work on Wall Street, but I chose computer technology b/c that was my hobby as a kid. So, I chose to work at cancer hospital in technology. While I realized either choice would not necessarily be a wrong one I found my choice to be aligned best with who I am. I wish everyone much love and to enjoy your short visit in this life."
This is fantastic lesson! Also what a pleasant surprise to see Esther Perel sitting among the audience and totally enjoying this talk!
I want this to help but I am still so stuck. I'll watch again and hope.
"This is really interesting, wish I found it sooner."
I can't belive I've waited this long to figure out what questions to ask. You answered it. Thank you. God bless you
this is so accurate i mean she was right about using science in making decisions by draw a line between 2 of them and choose one because it gives better option or it's more safe to do that way isn't the best way  to make good decision it is just depend  on us who we are giving out the best reasons to choose it
This has been very helpful. Thank you.
10:30 best part starts
"I come here and watch this video every time I am faced with a decision that could affect the course of my life. And each time I remind myself to be true to myself and the person that I am (or that I choose to be). I firmly believe that the way we choose to approach what we live really does make a difference. I am eternally grateful to have seen this video by chance all those years ago and to be able to see it again today. 

I would like to wish the best of luck to all those who find themselves in the position of having to make a ""difficult choice"". I hope you always have the strength and courage to choose what is true for yourself."

Deje de lado la lista de pros y contras y la interminable comparaci√≥n y an√°lisis de cada caracter√≠stica. Deja ir el miedo y de tomar la ruta m√°s segura y f√°cil.

How about you just keep adding in options until one new one is cleanly better than the prior ones. Haha
"I listened to this talk so many times.  It has changed my life.

It helped me ""crack"" this person called ""myself"" üòä. Thank you so mucb Ruth üôèüôè"
"What if you choose based on who you feel you are/ want to become, and it still doesn't work out, based on factors you couldn't foresee: an example, a few years ago I adopted a ten year old rescue dog, it was taking a leap of faith because I have 5 beloved cats at home (but love dogs and used to have them until they died of old age) -- I brought the rescue dog home and it became clear, despite going about the introductions in as slow a way as I had read was necessary/ separating them but allowing them to see one another etc., the dog would have killed my cats (despite being told at the shelter he was good with cats). I contacted a trainer to see what was possible and she said it was unsafe since the dog was older, this cat reactivity was unlikely to change and even if it could it would be a long stressful time for the cats and the dog, and I should bring the dog back to the shelter. This was something unimaginable but what I ended up having to do for the safety of my cats and also so the dog could have a chance at a loving, cat free home. Now, if I want to try to adopt a dog again, and choose based on who I am/ want to become, which is an animal lover who wants to say ""yes"" to animals who need a home as long as I can keep up with all their needs, I have this past experience that tells me, you can choose based on your own becoming but it doesn't necessarily mean it will feel like the better choice once the unforeseens become visible. Yes, any experience is growthful, but I guess I wish the speaker could have spoken a bit to this kind of thing, the unforeseens...."

"Ruth Chang says that hard choices are hard because none of the alternatives is way better than the other. Therefore, even small choices can be hard. Whether to have chocolate ice cream or creme brulee can be a very hard choice indeed, if I like them both and if I am craving for sweets at that moment.  So what do we do? We take the safest option.

We decide to become engineers than artists because statistically, the probability of getting a job as an engineer is higher than that of an artist. So, we take the safest option, because we fear that we are too stupid to understand the better option if the choice to make is hard. We prefer not to take any risks and we go for the option that is rationally comforting.

This is the very mistake we make. Remember, in hard choices no option is better than the other. We simply do not know‚Ä¶How can we know that engineering makes us happier in our future lives? Unfortunately, there are no fast forward and rewind buttons for life. So, does it really make sense to conclude that engineering is the better option? It's not and whether we like it or not at the end of the day hard choice is the only way to make our life easier. How ironic."
"Ruth Chang says that there is something we have misunderstood about hard choices. These are not a source of agony, a reason for sorrowful days or sleepless nights. Instead, these are chances for us to personally grow as human beings. ‚ÄúUnderstanding hard choices helps us uncover a hidden power that each one of us possesses.‚Äù"
"Don't try to make the right decision, make the decision right."
How to make hard choices? Shouldn't we be asking men this question? ü§£ üòß
This was really a very inspiring talk and I‚Äòm truly amazed by it. And I believe that in the future I will be able to think that way about hard choices. Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt make the one I‚Äòm struggling with right now. The safe option is not a 100% what I really want but it would be the most logical one. On the other hand the option that I fear in some ways would mean giving up everything and I think this one could be the one I could regret. So I can either choose something I know I won‚Äôt be really happy about or I can choose the one that I might regret
"Brilliant üëè üëè 
Ask yourself  a simple  question: Is the choice  you are about  to make will expand you and you will  grow?

Then ask yourself  another  one:
What will I  do  if I have 6 months  to live?
... same answer don't  think so...

What If you  eventually  understand  that   the choice  you are about  to make has already been  done by you in another  parallel  reality ? Actually  you finally  got it you just imagine  you have  a choice.  Well  you don't.

Have  a  lovely  day to all of us"

"A ""Dyson sphere"" is the dumbest astrophysics hypothesis in all of human history. As for this particular star, ""We don't know what is going on, but we're working on finding out,"" is sufficient. 

Maybe it's a fleet of space-busses taking extraterrestrial ""children"" to space-school, and the long pauses between events are Spring and Summer Break? 

That's at least as good a hypothesis as a Dyson sphere."
"The theory of Dyson spheres is at best absurd, at worst, ludicrous.
To think that a civilisation capeable of constructing a mega structure around it's star to capture energy,
Would endeavour to do so, while other forms of limitless energy would be available to that advanced civilisation,
Is plain silly.
We, here, now, are on the verge of fusion energy, limitless cheap energy,
Other more exotic energy will be available within the next one hundred years.
The mere construction around a star would probably use all of the material from dozens of planets, the length of construction measured in thousands of years,
Whatever planets remained in those solar systems would see dramatic, maybe even catastrophic falls in sunlight, weather pattern carnage, and eco systems collapse.
Dyson spheres are nonsense."
"Some time ago a telescope observed something taking energy from our sun and there was many hypotheses commentary about that, is the only thing we can do about until nobody remembers the event it‚Äôs sad but‚Ä¶"
"""Anything that uses a lot of energy produces a lot of heat"" is mentioned 11:04. But this isn't always the case‚Äîit depends on how efficiently the energy is converted into the intended form of work.

For example, electric heaters are designed to convert electrical energy directly into heat, so nearly all the energy becomes heat. However, LED lights or electric motors are much more efficient: they convert most of the energy into light or motion, respectively, with minimal heat loss. So while energy usage often correlates with heat production, the relationship depends on the efficiency and purpose of the device."

Point Webb at it
"Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the star's large irregular changes in brightness, but as of 2024, none of them fully explain all aspects of the resulting light curve."
"A lot of you're probably wondering why does she look so familar. Well she has uncanny resemblance to Matt Servitto (Deputy Brock in Banshee, Gov. Bob Sweeney in the Billions).
You're welcome."
"Has anyone considered the possibility that this star has multiple planets and some of them cross the star at the same time causing more sunlight to be blocked and also extending the length of time that the light of blocked as well as the irregular dipping of the lights?  Even in our solar system we have planetary alignment.  Perhaps these alignments occur more frequently on that system, perhaps that star has maybe 20 planets orbiting it and perhaps they are not as far apart from one and other as our planets are."
not at all interested in the hypothetical after opening my that Carl quote
"So you are telling me that all these scientists and those 300,000 science enthusiasts could not think of the simple possibility that multiple planets could be passing in front of that star (not necessarily orbiting it) just by chance? I mean you are looking at a star so far away you can barely see the light of it, there can be so many other celestial objects passing in front of it and all you can think of is ""alien megastructures""... I wonder how many real scientist are out there these days and not just a bunch of nerds with PHDs..."

I'm not an Astronomer but what if there was more than one planet orbiting the Star but at different speeds? Only on occasions would the planets coincide and act in unison to block more significant amounts of light.
"See no reason to go to alien intelligence to explain this.  More likely the occlisions are from a multitude of planets, both large and not so large, all in the same plane perpendicular to us.  Their periods of rotation vary as does their size, but periodically several, or even half a dozen, eclipse our sight line near simultaneously, over a few days, a week...a few months.  Probably hard to model a planetary system with a dozen Jupiter sized planets, but still easier than invoking alien technology?"

"The star in question is almost 1,500 light years away from Earth. At that distance, planetary celestial bodies could be causing the dimming. And this star's by no means the only star which experiences dimming in brightness."
Occam‚Äôs razor tells me it‚Äôs just a bunch of rubble bouncing around after a couple of planets collided. It‚Äôs a boring explanation but it‚Äôs more likely than an alien war let‚Äôs face it.
They debunked it. It was dust doing all that dimming.

"Anybody clear my doubt!  How come distant planetary system we observe, we are able to detect the planet, which is orbiting around the distant star, we are aligned with that means earth, the distant planet and distant star? Means we are at point where far stars or planets are above or below our view point. And some might come into our alignment!
Scientist observe star and measure the light coming from it and the difference they detect shows some planet or something is revolving around it. My question is how come we are always aligned with far far away star system?"
Could it be a three star system in which one of the stars emits much less light than the others?
Begs the question: if the alien planet had exhausted their planets energy - where would they get the enormous amount of energy it would take to build a structure around a Sun?

"If our hypothetical aliens, i.e. those of the hypothesis Tabetha thinks the less likely one, are or were living on or in a solid planet, chances are that the interior of the planet, like our own, has or had a vast amount of hyper-fossilized collapsed supernova, the stuff that is responsible for our roughly 4500 million years of Earth's existence. Admittedly, they'd need to use that sort of thhing to build Dyson spheres, but it's hard to believe it'd be worth it."

"Suppose one planet was blocking the view of one or more plantes as it began to cross in front, and then the other planets emergered into view , this could explain the fluxuation as some planets with tighter orbits could orbit at much faster time wise ?"
"At the moment when there was talk of the possibility of a very advanced civilization, which, however, cannot manage nuclear fusion and is therefore dependent on the radiation of nuclear fusion from the central star, the curtain fell on me inwardly and the show was over.

The strange pattern shown in the video of the Kepler effect is because we on earth are observing the planetary object passing the star in an elliptical orbit north to south travelling towards us.  The other Kepler observations will be objects passing the same star at different elliptical orbits therefore creating smaller dips as they appear to pass more quickly to us as observers. 
I am certain that the results would be entirely different if observed from anywhere else except earth."

What if multiple planets transiting during those times? Multiple planets with moons?
BRETHEN MOONS!!! We need to stay away. It's the CONVERGENCE event happening over there.

"So, here's the big question - what kind of shockingly poor computer programming is involved is order to miss those multiple, MASSIVE (compared to the baseline) drops in signal?? The non-uniformity (as a massive 'clue') SHOULD also have been detected by that same 'search' programming.
--> Honestly, there is some serious questions to be asked about this, and makes us wonder at the overall 'quality' of the science being undertaken here.

Additionally...
1) The 'observable' universe is currently believed to be around 93 billion light years across. This is what we can 'see' from Earth or from our space telescopes.
2) The entire universe is currently believed to be around......wait for it...........9.................TRILLION light years across."

"Lots of planets and they aline at some point in time to show such a dip (?), ... just saying ..."
"All we are able to see is a drop of water in the entire ocean
That cannot be the only mysterious star in the entire ocean.
If we go beyond that drop we could even see stars that can breakdance"
"Too many natural explanations.  A Saturn like gas giant with large rings and perhaps a rotational ""wobble"" making the planet itself seem to increase and decrease in size due to the orientation of the rings between us and the star.  An asteroid belt that would put our own asteroid belt to shame, out near the range of Pluto.  Huge clumps of planets/asteroids causing irregular shifts in light getting through.  I like this better than the comet theory, though it's a similar explanation...  just random debris, although very large debris.  Random large debris causing seemingly random large fluctuations.  

Or, instead of our system which has 8 planets, this system has 140.  Many of these planets have lined up and have similar orbits.  Like Pluto and Charon, many are more like co-planets than a main planet with moon(s).  Their revolutions with each other cause rapid fluctuations in what seems to be the size of only one massive planet.  And so on.  

Either that or the Death Star theory.  üôÑ"

"Nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) and oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) make up about 99% of the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, the much-dreaded increase in CO‚ÇÇ over the last 100 years? A whopping 0.02%. That‚Äôs right‚ÄîCO‚ÇÇ is about 5,000 times less abundant than N‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ. So the idea that this tiny trace gas is singlehandedly steering the climate ship, based solely on its ‚Äúmotion‚Äù in the atmosphere, is a bit of a stretch, to say the least.  The motion of the earth's atmphsere (wind, convection) is used to jusitify the CO‚ÇÇ climate change theory but if we‚Äôre going to talk thermodynamics‚Äîat room temperature, the molar heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) are roughly 29.4 J/mol¬∑K for O‚ÇÇ, 29.1 for N‚ÇÇ, and 37.1 for CO‚ÇÇ. So yes, CO‚ÇÇ can hold a bit more heat, but nothing that screams the planetary climate changed experience today nor does the motion of the atomsphere make up this difference.  In another obtuse justification of the ostesible CO‚ÇÇ theory.  A microwave oven analogy is used to justify the CO‚ÇÇ theory climate change where the screen of the door ,00002% of the volume of the microwave oven is used to justify that CO‚ÇÇ  is causing climate change but the door screen is composed of solid matter yet  CO‚ÇÇ is obviously a gas.  You cannot bake and apple pie using oranges.  The real culprit? Thermodynamic pollution‚Äîexcess heat being dumped into the environment from human activity. But instead of focusing on that, the conversation keeps circling around CO‚ÇÇ like it‚Äôs some kind of atmospheric supervillain. Why? Because apparently, applying basic common sense is too radical a move in today‚Äôs climate discourse."

There are trillion of dollars worth of Nickel, Cobalt, Copper, and Manganese (All needed for the energy transition). The largest measured Nickel deposit on the planet is in the NORI-D area of the CCZ that is under contract with TMC. There are fewer environmental impacts from harvesting Polymetallic Nodules than clearcutting the rainforest. If we move fast we can transition from Fossil Fuels to Renewables and batteries."

"The Earth is ridding its self of humanity. This is just the very first few seconds of the catastrophe to follow. This is the Earths sixth extinction event. No one can stop evolution. It continues on into the future. After the heat of climate change has done its job the Earth will go through another ice age. After the ice age is over the Earth will emerge pure and cleansed again and from there every thing will start over. The purity of the Garden of Eden will return as evolution does its job. This time there will be no humans nor any monkeys nor anything that could evolve into any human form. 10 million years will have passed and entirely new forms of species will now inhabit the Earth. Nothing Humans try to do will change anything. The future will not be changed.

"Chinese electric vehicles are often marketed as environmentally friendly, yet they rely heavily on electricity generated from coal, making their true carbon footprint far from ""green."" While they produce no direct emissions, their operation is still largely powered by fossil fuels.  

Despite this, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) promotes its EV industry as a leader in sustainability, conveniently ignoring the fact that China remains the world's largest carbon emitter. By branding these vehicles as ""eco-friendly,"" China profits from global environmental concerns while continuing to rely on coal.  

Moreover, the CCP has a long history of controlling information, from covering up the Tiananmen Square massacre, where 30,000 students were killed, to suppressing any narratives that challenge its official stance. As a result, many Chinese citizens genuinely believe their EVs are helping the environment, unaware of the broader reality.  

Consumers who truly care about sustainability should consider whether buying an EV powered by coal-generated electricity aligns with their values. Supporting products from countries that prioritize clean energy may be a more effective way to fight climate change."

City Sprawl Now Large Enough to Sway Global Warming Over Land

Urban land now reaches farther than ever, and so too does its influence on global warming

"Without having more products to spread the cost over of the required infrastructure the 1st world economies have no prayer to replace fossil fuels.
God gave mankind the source of energy and 2 steps down line.  Mankind will have design ways to store, distribute, make additional products to spread the cost of infrastructure over and increase the value of low value assets into durable high value ones.
It will take both Elon Musk and President Trump to enable all investors win to transfer from fossil fuels.  I would love to invite them to share my insight."

Do they remember that trees are responsible to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and return Oxygen.
Is it not smarter to invest all those billions in replanting back trees in areas and countries where desert exist.
For those who is even thinking about mention, how trees take a 1000 years to grow. 
I am asking you, did you ever plant a tree? 
A forest tree takes about 7- 14 days for it's seed to germinate and will take about 3 - 4 years to reach an average height of 15 - 20 feet. 
I know because I proven this.
If we all know that trees are the natural remover of carbon dioxide, why is the billions not being invested to replant them?"

"I'm okay with government policy based on science, on fact. But I object to policies based on this climate change propaganda nonsense. The small changes happening over the last few hundred years are natural, not human caused. What we need to focus on, as we have, is pollution prevention, management of natural resources. CO2 is required for life on the planet, if you remember high school science. CO2 circulates between the ground, ocean and atmosphere. We are coming off a planet low of CO2 and would be better with more for higher plant food production. Water vapor is the dominant greenhouse gas, basic science. Look in your car radiator, no CO2, but water for heat transfer and storage."

"Load of hot air. Climate change has been happening since the world existed. Minuscule (and unproven) rise in global temperatures of less than one degree in 100 years (with potentially 20 percent due to human influence) has more to do with cleaner air and lesss smoke. In any case, I wish it would heat up a bit more. I would burn more carbon to assist this process if I didn‚Äôt know it would have no effect whatsoever. At least the ISA will escape this nonsense when Trump puts a line through it. Europe will not be so lucky and will continue to pay for nothing and continue to ruin their own manufacturing and industry."
"A Climate Remediation Suggestion

	There is a lot of discussion about Global Warming, whether it really exists, how serious a threat and the role of Carbon Dioxide. However, the following is generally agreed. Namely that a lot of CO2 has been released into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution and a lot of it has ended up in solution in sea waters. There is at least 150 times as much CO2 in a cubic meter of sea water as there is in a cubic meter of atmosphere at NTP. This is acidifying the sea waters and possibly harming Coral Reefs and other fauna. There has also been some agreement that the Temperature of the Earth has warmed somewhat.
	The Earth's rotation and the Coriolis Effect has formed a number of Tropical/Semi-Tropical Oceanic Gyres, within which the mass of sea water is rotating, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Anything floating, i.e., less dense than sea water tends to float towards the center of the Gyre. There are five main Gyres all of which are Tropical/Semitropical. They are the North Pacific, South Pacific, Indian, North Atlantic, and South Atlantic Oceans. Together they form a very large proportion of the 70% of the Earth's surface which is covered by water.
	The North Pacific has a lot of floating debris, ""the Great Pacific Garbage Patch"", some of it being debris washed off Japan by tsunamis following the recent Fukishima Earth Quake. The Southern Hemisphere Gyres do not appear to contain much floating debris.
	The North Atlantic Gyre is unique. It contains the Sargasso Sea which is characterized by the presence of two species of Sargassum which float by virtue of oxygen-filled follicles. It was discovered (first documented) by Columbus from his voyage in 1492. There is a Sargasso Sea Commission, with an Office in Washington DC, which is charged with protecting the Sargasso Sea from pollution etc. There is a website that basically describes all of the positive ecological values of the Sea.
	Since 2011 the Sargassum appears to be overflowing from the Sargasso Sea and moving via the west bound currents across the north coast of South America into the Caribbean and sometimes into the Gulf of Mexico. This has been attributed to agricultural run off from the USA or Brazil but might be due to the increased levels of CO2 in solution.
	It has been washing up on beaches through out this region, as one might expect to happen. When it dies and rots it emits H2S. Since a lot of these beaches have tourism as their main industry, the weed has to be removed manually which has given Sargassum a bad name. There are several Facebook entities that keep track of Sargassum landings and there are frequent postings enquiring about Sargassum occurrence on specific tourist areas.
	The occurrence of Sargassum in the Caribbean would, however, make it very easy to put live Sargassum into the Pacific off the west coast of Mexico. From there the currents would carry it all the way across the Pacific, photosynthesizing and growing all the way absorbing a lot of CO2 and heat energy, photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction. Absorbing CO2 from the Ocean would allow CO2 from the Atmosphere to dissolve in the sea. The Sargassum would probably stay in the North Pacific Gyre but some might drift into the South Pacific.
	One might balk at the idea of covering a lot of the Oceans with Sargassum but it does have uses. It can be used to make ethanol, paper or cardboard. Some one in the Caribbean is making construction bricks from it and others are feeding it to goats..
	If there appears to be some benefit from Pacific Sargassum we could easily add Sargassum to the other Gyres using ships that are transiting the Panama Canal. It seems likely that some Sargassum will eventually get into the South Atlantic Gyre, but that may take a while.

"Climate change refers to significant and lasting changes in the Earth's climate, especially an increase in temperature and changes in weather patterns, primarily due to human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes.The primary greenhouse gases that are currently increasing in the atmosphere due to human activities are carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O)

2. Cutting down forests
3. Farming livestock

"Al Gore's (US vise president 1992-2020) successful war on science and scientists maybe coming to an end.  This video has the United Nation‚Äôs Climate Change disclaimer.  Global warming was officially reported at 1.1¬∞C in 1991 and 1.06¬∞C in 2022.   There has been no climate change due to global warming.  Global warming at 1.5¬∞C was predicted to begin climate change with stronger observable hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The cause of global warming is not know in 2024 despite decades of science studies going back to the 1970s.

It is scientifically impossible for greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.  Before Al Gore became US vise president in 1992 earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect was taught in US public education.   

All the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth is completely absorbed in earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect by greenhouse gases within a few meters of the radiating surface out to a maximum of 20 meters from the radiating surface adding 5.55¬∞C (10¬∞F) to earth‚Äôs average temperature.  Its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules bumping into to each other.   At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over a 99% share of earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect is from water vapor.

The back of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.   The IPCC has been transparent with its data acknowledging it is not dealing with active greenhouse gases.  

Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the radiating surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  

0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2. 

Arctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   The warmer Arctic Ocean water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice surface cover resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.

Atmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet.  C3 plants evolved over 100 million years ago when atmospheric CO2 levels were ten times those of today determined by plant fossils.

The Earth‚Äôs oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it‚Äôs chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.

There has been no credible Climate Change due to global warming as of 2024.  Climate Change was expected to start to take place when global warming reached 1.5¬∞C causing observable stronger hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The term Climate Change started being used at the beginning of the 1980s to cause alert to a broad audience of the long term effects of increasing average global temperatures.  

The promotional term Climate Change in the early 1980s was grounded on actions already taken by Gulf-of-Mexico offshore crude oil drilling companies in the 1970s to build for stronger hurricanes due to warmer Gulf waters predicted to start when average global temperatures increased 1.5¬∞C on track for 2010.  That action was taken for a predicted long term change in weather patterns or climate that backed up the use of the term Climate Change."

"TAKE THE RED PILL

The meteorological systems called the Northern and Southern Hadley Cells, with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) around their centre, cover about 65% of the planet's surface. Any changes within the sweep of the Hadley cells will affect conditions within the ITCZ. The importance of this is that the cloud mass within the ITCZ reflects incoming solar heat back out to space. Less cloud = more heat. More cloud = less heat. 

Have humans affected the balance in the ITCZ's governance of the solar heat budget? YES. 
Are those effects enough to produce the additional heat gradient, commonly referred to as global warming? YES.

So how do humans produce such an effect? The annual, July to October flooding of the lower Nile created a warm, shallow, 26,000km2 evaporative surface in the Sahara Desert. The 13.5mm (4,000m3/s) of water evaporated per day was pulled south by the Northern Hadley cell when every few days it would rise onto the Ethiopian Highlands where it would create a disturbance within the west flowing monsoon, to create a Keremt storm. The Keremt storm pushed westwards across Sub Saharan Africa (5,N to 20,N) would become organised into African Easterly Waves (AEW) which eventually formed USA sized solar reflective marine stratocumulus cloudscapes. By putting dams on the Nile at Aswan form 1902 we inadvertently regulated this meteorological chain reaction, mostly by reducing the frequency of the AEWs, thus reduced the cloud cover over the equatorial oceans = the oceans became warmer, and distributed this additional heat poleward and into the atmosphere. From 1964 when the AHD completely stored the flood in a much smaller and deeper reservoir, the frequency of the AEWs reduced again = even more solar heat. 

This can obviously be checked by producing an anomaly chart of the ocean surface affected by the AEW system. Integrating that with other data for rainfall and river-flow. Suggesting in 1945 to 1964 mean value. Theromcline: -20m min. Temp gradient of Canary current from 23N to 17N, July to Sept.

"This American fastest long-range reconnaissance aircraft flying at an altitude of 26,000 meters at Mach 3.5 carries 46,254 liters of fuel. It consumes 21,000 liters per hour of flight, and the cost of one hour of flight is $18,000. The average EU country with population around 38 Milion people uses yearly - 28 million cubic meters. That means per person in the scale of year it is burned 760 liters of fuel - I ask, who is really polluting the planet? Why is there an organized ecological charade that indoctrinates people with nonsense, making them believe they are the ones responsible for climate change, and therefore must be taxed for it?""

"If the polar caps melt and the seas rise then 3 things are sure to happen. Firstly every port , home, and building on all coastal areas will have to be demolished and rebuilt further inland so your looking at zero unemployment worldwide for a very long time. Secondly, all commercial fishing vessels won‚Äôt be able to offload their catch ( no ports). If fishing boats can‚Äôt unload they won‚Äôt go out to get the fish, this would give fish stock‚Äôs in the ocean years to replenish their numbers. And thirdly with no ability to import and export goods ( no ports) then Industry will have to be developed ‚Äù in ‚Äú country to provide for societal needs, another factor in creating zero unemployment.

"Heres what they dont tell you  Solar companies only offer (to my knowledge)  ""grid tied packages"". So your house generates power, meter goes backwards. Then you use power, meter spins forward. No batteries. I know of 3 states that once they had enough ppl on a system, simply took away the equal KW pay. The ppl paid for the system, they produce power to the grid, residents bill keeps increasing. You will aslo NEVER get a check and all states that I know has already made laws where you cant just set up a grid and panels to make money. Sound like a scam? It 100% is. Wind turbines use power to turn when the wind isnt extremely strong. They need a certain rotation per minute to generate power. The props bow if not. They are 20 to 35%  efficient. Most off grid people use natural gas to fuel the high-energy appliances. Strange that now natural gas is the new enemy of ""going green"".

"thank you, it will change soon, there are other source of energy like sea is huge source of energy, further more  we can prevent these phenomena like cyclone and flood and wildfire by using this hot seasonal atmospheric condition, recent years in summer, geothermal energy happens in surface of coastline, there are many countries in coastline with seasonal hot weather and water condition, in sum-up, by using this energy not only is economical but also reduce global warming like Japan, China, India, Mediterranean countries, Iran, Mexico, Us, Canada, (Africa and Arabian countries....) . I invented new method base on air pressure rules and quantum physics ionization sea water minerals in strong dynamic magnet and electrical field and electric chemical reactions for producing electricity and fresh water and fertilizer. 7 methods for reducing global warming I mentioned in my profile."
"So I‚Äôve done some thinking, and I think that the black holes probably better to describe the journey of my thoughts.
So if you got something or anything falling into a black hole, and it starts to speed up faster and faster and faster to the speed of light. 
Everything breaks apart by the force of gravity, falling faster and faster and faster not because the speed of light, but because the speed of the medium is being sucked into the hole, all the particles be split and torn apart everything is torn apart, spaghettified is a simpler term but loses its meaning as you would imaging noodles, but noodles is a thing, and this is not a thing, further and further this is  more deeper everything gets torn apart explosive energy so maybe that some will be transmitted out as some  Hawking radiation I assume.

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there because you‚Äôre gonna fall further than the distance from the horizon, to the center, how to describe it, the core of the black hole is infinitely far away you‚Äôll never reach there. 
You‚Äôll evaporate well belong before you can get there as it  much muuuuuuuch further than the horizon is from the center, so It can‚Äôt be explained in normal physics. I think you have to imagine Interdimensionaly there is no end and to get there the fabric of space is stretches faster than the speed of light can travel, the wave of lengths will be stretched so thin to be longer than red light can stretch, quarks and gluons etc will be pulled apart. And exploded.

üß≠ time has no meaning, the decay of particles will slow to a mear stop, the explosions as a little particle bodies are torn apart will slow to a mear stop, as to be traveling faster than light relative, the medium stretching faster than light can travel. 
Perhaps üßê maybe the medium of space time has been torn apart as well?
It‚Äôs quite paradoxical, thinking I know to have explosions that don‚Äôt decay to have particles that don‚Äôt care but yet they get torn apart, that‚Äôs all  my little brain can take üß†

If you could see inside the black hole, everything would be curved back towards the center. If you tried to look out, you couldn‚Äôt see it. if you could just see the point where everything is going, the center is in every direction because light is being curved back towards a center, but no you can‚Äôt see anything as light can‚Äôt come back from the center
And every direction is towards the center from your perception because the lights always curving back towards the center of which is unreachable‚Ä¶  like I said brain üß† go boom üí• ü§™üòµ‚Äçüí´

ü§™Haha I hope that makes sense ü§™

The mas of the black hole üï≥Ô∏è is all  accumulated mass within it even though those particles may not touch each other ever as they‚Äôre being torn apart for further towards the center closer now but not closer you‚Äôll never reach there‚Ä¶

ü§î hmm my mind is turning to mush
Think of it like a suspended try you put a hose with running water on it,
Then poke a hole üï≥Ô∏è in the tray 
The water will spiral towards a hole due to earths spin and gravitation and maybe magnetic fields.
Then down through the hole into a laminate flow, then as it falls faster, the flow will pull apart into droplets, the droplets will pull apart due to earth‚Äôs gravity faster against the air medium, and probably break apart to smaller droplets.
And allow those droplets to fall through a Dyson ring fan on full power!
Or a compressed air blower venturi and the droplets will be split & separated further into a fine mist‚Ä¶

Then you‚Äôll need a particle accelerator to speeds where high speeds can be accomplish on earth,  but we need to go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter. Than we can accomplish to do on earth‚Ä¶ 
Interdimensionally faster!

Good grief Charlie Brown.
2- Time does not slow down the faster you travel.  If you get in a spaceship and fly to a planet that is 10 light years away and you can travel at the speed of light,  here's what happens . (Leave the acceleration and deceleration phase out of the equation for the sake of this scenario) You would travel 10 years outbound and 10 years back. That's 20 years folks. Pretty simple math. When you come home you will therefore be exactly 20 years older and magically your friends and family on earth will also be 20 years older . You will not have aged 2 years while everyone back on earth magically aged 250 years . ¬†(Like every b movie portrays)
(Maybe your wrist watch ran faster or ran slower while you were in zero gravity  but its irrelevant) You travelled a distance of 20 light years at the speed of light.  That takes 20 years .... full stop.
2+ 2 = 4. It always was and always will be .
In fact , I hereby declare that I have discovered that which eluded Einstein. I have found the one  ""Theory of Everything""      It's the one equation by which all things in the universe must function.   2+2=4.
All physics , calculus and Quantum Conundrums all must eventually be solved to adhere to this simple truth ...¬†

The catharsis of stasis dictates the Arrow of Time. The terrible curse or a welcome boon?!
"Therefore, the catharsis of stasis means all information cannot be salvaged and reclaimed."
"If all information can be reconstructed, then there would be no possibility for information to arise at all in the first place and the only information ever available must be first information. Period. Because there would be no scope or chance for learning, mutation, unlearning, or energy caught in a pattern and trapped and locked up as information, for every the only form or only pattern from the etymology of the word information; that is, you are informed in-form about only one thing, only one form or meaning to data; for example, a tadpole is the only thing in-form or the only and final form, in-formed; therefore, you deny a packing up and locking of a tadpole. Period. But nature has other ideas; it exploits quantum tunneling to unweave the intricate tapestry of a tadpole and then weave a even more intricate and complicated tapestry of a fully fledged frog allowing ample room for metamorphosis or translation or change of basis vectors or negotiation and renegotiation, construction and reconstruction, what I mean is form, inform, and finally transform or learning, learning updates, information--continued learning is possible but will be impossible if all information can be put together again if and only if it is the one and only information ever--reforming information, finally stasis when the learning curve plateaus out, over fitting, unfit for new learning being cursed as the best fit. What now? OMG! It is all over for the tadpole, dead end compounding stasis, bludgeoning Atrophy, impending extinction! Lo! Behold! Here comes the Messiah, the saviour, nature and performs a miracle: the purging, the Castrol, the catharsis of stasis which is releasing the toxins or energy caught and trapped in a pattern and locked up as matter, time, but how? Nature shows the way not your stupid God: the catharsis of stasis exploiting quantum tunneling, the unlocking, the unpacking, the unweaving, the realising, the unlearning, the energy of freedom, sudden phenomenonal increase in learning potential and mutation potential, now learning is possible, mutation is possible, and transformation is possible and the tadpole has metamorphosed and transformed into a frog, mutation, and evolution replayed. Jiddu Krishnamurti puts it beautifully to David Bohm, Sir, it is the same energy but now it has a totally different quality(, the new); therefore and thereby Jiddu Krishnamurti abolishes external agency or your stupid God!"

"In the BM framework, the most massive black holes did not come after stars ‚Äî they came before them, as natural consequences of early-cycle curvature saturation in the cosmic lattice. Before galaxies and stars existed, the compression‚Äìcurvature field was already structured. Regions where the lattice geometry reached maximum compression created King Nodes ‚Äî stable, ultra-dense curvature zones that are the BM equivalent of supermassive black holes. These were seeded by:

1. Field harmonics left over from the previous cycle‚Äôs Snap Point, which concentrated mass‚Äìfrequency in certain zones.
2. Baryonic corridors funnelling matter and energy into these nodes even before stars condensed.
3. Curvature saturation thresholds that were crossed without any need for stellar collapse ‚Äî the field geometry itself created the well deep enough to trap light.

Later, these pre-stellar black holes acted as anchors for galaxy formation ‚Äî their curvature fields drew in gas, dust, and plasma, igniting star formation around them. This reverses the traditional sequence: in BM physics, black holes make galaxies, not the other way around.

The 'strength' of these wells was never 'created from nothing' ‚Äî it was the direct outcome of field geometry that had been storing and focusing curvature since before our cycle began."

"That is wrong. Times stops not inside black hole, but far far far outsize of universe. Easy to prove. More mass, slower speed - more time. Less mass, faster speed - less time. Closer to blackhole you are more time you have. From distanse - it looks like it slows down and object closeer to blackhole freezing. But not because it has less time, because it has more space/time fabric."

To the relativistic observer falling into a black hole, the event horizon is an invisible boundary. But to quantum virtual particles, it is a hologram!

"Interesting what you said in the end about what Einstein said about finding something deeply hidden. Reminded me of a revelation from God to the Holy Prophet Mohammad pbuh, about why He created human beings: ""I was a hidden treasure, then I desired that I be found."" The Quran encourages and praises people who ponder over the creations of the Heavens and the Earth: ""In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of the night and the day there are indeed Signs for the people of understanding; those who remember God while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and ponder over the creation of the heavens and the earth: (saying) 'Our Lord, Thou hast not created this in vain; nay, Holy art Thou; save us, then, from the punishment of the Fire.'"" (3:191-192, Holy Quran)"
"As I have previously stated, there can be no ""sitting on the fence"" (or anything close to it)-- Top Down cosmology is either mostly right or terribly wrong.
 
The biggest problem with Bottom Up BBT cosmology is the problem of entropy, central to thermodynamics and the virial theorem, stating in its simplest form that ""for a stable, self-gravitating system, the average kinetic energy of the particles is equal to half the negative of the average potential energy."" With the Big Bang theory, the early universe was too hot to form particles, including the Higgs boson and the yet-to-be-found (and still theoretical) graviton, meaning that there would have been no gravity and no space time.
 
This is a major problem with Big Bang explanations which systematically ignore it by simply stating that light of the Big Bang cooled by expansion and ""condensed"" to initially form the lightest particles. Without space time, what does ""expanding"" even mean?
 
In physics, there is the axiom called Occam's Razor: ""Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one. It's also known as the 'law of parsimony'. Essentially, when faced with competing hypotheses that all explain the same phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions is preferred.""
 
What can be simpler for the initial unity in the form of a ""primal atom"" required by both Top Down and Bottom Up cosmologies to divide into two, with proto-gravity/ Coulomb effects being initially equal and indistinguishable?. Yet the theory that requires ad hoc fixes every time there is a new discovery is preferred over the theory that actually predicts and accommodates discovery. In this Top Down quantum world, any creative hand was only required to invent math. The odds for intervention of that creative hand at any time are 50:50 at best, or ""too close to call.""
 
The Standard Model, initially devised in 1929 to prevent conflicts between religion and science, has only ensured that the two never find middle ground; hence, the current discord from the religious right regarding global warming and Darwin's evolution, among others."
Black holes don't exist even Stephen Hawkins admits now.
"The empirical method is most reliable in finding truth in the physical world. It employs the logic of mathematics in finding most probable outcome given a controlled set of variables. Religions are not concerned with that, and often depend upon intuition, emotions and customs not dependent upon objective reality found in scientific endeavors like physics.
 
Given that it is generally understood in the scientific community that the universe came from a single massive event, to begin to understand where we came from, there must be a theory that has reliable, predictive ability,
 
There is always the unknown (or ""God of the gap""), like when questioning the origin of the initial mass; but that is not required in order to posit the question, ""Given initial conditions like a single mass (nothing can be simpler or more ordered the one), aka,, 'cosmic egg' or 'primal atom,' how did that initial mass (generally accepted as most probable by all of the scientific community) transform to become the universe seen today?""
 
Again, there is no 100% certainty. The closest to that is found in abstract math. In application there is always a uncertainty, like when counting apples,.
 
There are two most-probable, very basic answers to ""The Question,"" ie, top down cosmology OR bottom up cosmology-- both are incompatible with one another.
 
Given this, top down cosmology, when properly understood, is broad enough to predict everything so far seen. like that by the JWST, for example, while bottom up (Big Bang or Standard Model) cosmology must be constantly revised with ad hoc explanations every time there is a new finding, top down cosmology wins!
 
Top down is not properly understood, because it is commonly interpreted to mean that there are many realities caused by cascading events; but this is not the case, because everything seen and unseen remains causally connected by quantum entanglement.
 
""The universe is not locally real (Nobel Prize already awarded).""
 
Do not be deceived. Basic understanding of the universe comes before all else.

"In the blockchain of events framework, where we act as qubits of information in a self correcting code through inner.self and external validators, what is before the Big Bang is yet to happen, past and present act in superposition as regret (photon states), future and present as potential (wave state). Both stationary and time moving clocks. This is why it takes more time to reach our potentiality and outbursts are more immediate. Unless we are present in the present. In a way it acts like the three polarizer paradox where through reimanns R(s) = 1/2 (0/45/90) the present allows opportunities or gifts / challenges to mine and reward. As this zeta zeroes on the critical line of that wave of light going through as we observe the present. The Big Bang is fueled by inflationary repulsive, so regret is repulsive (negative gravity) real numbers/ entropy stored in the void / black hole Hawkins radiating and potential (imaginary number multiplying the negative gravity) is then positive, attracting us toward that progress. Photoelectric theory acts in voluntary exposure to fear (E=hf) as we increase the frequency not the intensity. Basically the world wants to go back to a state of order, pure ness like a new born baby and while inside we hold inner hurt childs that lacked or had failed caregivers or other external validators, but we have the potential to become those and individuate and entangle and heal. To then repair the mirror and emit light and so to also heal others. But at the same time we can travel to the past through pride and avoid the future too, this is why is important to be present with the gift of the present, full of wonders of the prime numbers that represent the archetypal egenstates. And should be time to do so."

Another way to ask it is can you starve a black hole where there is enough Hawking Radiation can the black hole loses its  ability to maintain a singularity?

And if a singularity cannot be reversed, it can only evaporate to nothing ‚Ä¶ why? 

What is holding the singularity if there isn‚Äôt enough mass to maintain a singularity?"

"UPT (Unified Plasma Theory) explains this ""deeper look into gravity"". 

UPT vs. Einstein Tensor (GŒºŒΩ)
""Mass tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells mass how to move.""
That‚Äôs the essence of the Einstein Tensor‚Äîgravity as geometry.

Unified Plasma Theory (UPT) offers a deeper, field-based perspective:

UPT Core Counterpoint:
Spacetime curvature is not the cause of gravity‚Äîit is the visual echo of field coherence in motion.

The Einstein Tensor assumes:
    A vacuum with bendable geometry
    Mass and energy deform that geometry
    That deformation affects motion paths of matter

But UPT asserts:
    There is no true vacuum‚Äîonly dynamic plasma fields at varying densities
    Mass is not a fixed property but a product of collapsed field geometry
    ""Curvature"" is simply how field pressure gradients appear under certain plasma conditions

Example:
Einstein describes gravity as curvature but never defines what is curving, or why.

UPT explains it directly:
What looks like curvature is a real, measurable field pressure differential.
Plasma fields entrain and spiral. This creates torsion, flow, and attraction‚Äîall observable as gravity, with no geometric abstraction required.

Field-Based Replacement (UPT):
UPT replaces the Einstein Tensor with a dynamic plasma field expression:

F(œÅ, v, Œ¶, T),
Where:
œÅ = charge density
v = field velocity
Œ¶ = field potential
T = torsion (field twist and rotation)

This function describes gravitational effects without bending spacetime‚Äîjust by observing how real plasma fields behave under coherence and motion.

Conclusion:
Einstein‚Äôs tensor describes effects.
UPT explains causes.

What if we're wrong about black holes?  Physics breaks down and the math becomes elusive. Is it possible that a black hole is no more fantastic than a huge planetary body that has enough mass creating a gravitational pull that light can't escape but isn't a hole at all. Since light can't escape we can't view it. The more mass the larger the eccretion disk and therefore could also be a larger sphere within instead of a hole the size of an atom. Just my uneducated take on some topic that seems religiously fantastic that we can't explain with regular physics.
If black holes possess a universe inside them does that mean that when two black holes merge then two universes are colliding and merging? And what happens inside those universes as they collide? Would you notice or feel anything?
"you fail at every point without recognising
that our universe is solid with cells we cannot see ,and as it expands a void appears that must not 
exist,so matter is created from the destruction of cells surrounding void to replace it.and so called black holes
containing the morphed matter become the source of everything we CAN see in the Universe,
so the expansion must be that our universe is a cell that has been compromised or rotated  by what exist 
outside it leaving it an ovoid instead of a sphere.. bleeding obvious."
Whatever happens to us singly or in community inevitable happens to us all. Everything is connected.
"I have always had this fundamental question that keeps bothering me, I can't quite imagine, what you can call a ""void"", there is always something throughout the universe, but there had to be nothing if something were to occupy that space, but I can't quite image ""nothingness"" without any fixed boundary."

"The black hole is a Kirby vacuum salesman in the sky doing his sales pitch and demo-ing the new Celestial G314, the time of our lives represented as pieces of dust barely feeling the pull at the very edge of the suction power, and we'll eventually get ripped apart and sucked off through a hole.

"The empirical method is most reliable in finding truth in the physical world. It employs the logic of mathematics in finding most probable outcome given a controlled set of variables. Religions are not concerned with that, and often depend upon intuition, emotions and customs not dependent upon objective reality found in scientific endeavors like physics.
 
Given that it is generally understood in the scientific community that the universe came from a single massive event, to begin to understand where we came from, there must be a theory that has reliable, predictive ability, 
 
There is always the unknown (or ""God of the gap""), like when questioning the origin of the initial mass; but that is not required in order to posit the question, ""Given initial conditions like a single mass (nothing can be simpler or more ordered the one), aka,, 'cosmic egg' or 'primal atom,' how did that initial mass (generally accepted as most probable by all of the scientific community) transform to become the universe seen today?""
 
Again, there is no 100% certainty. The closest to that is found in abstract math. In application there is always a uncertainty, like when counting apples,.
 
There are two most-probable, very basic answers to ""The Question,"" ie, top down cosmology OR bottom up cosmology-- both are incompatible with one another.
 
Given this, top down cosmology, when properly understood, is broad enough to predict everything so far seen. like that by the JWST, for example, while bottom up (Big Bang or Standard Model) cosmology must be constantly revised with ad hoc explanations every time there is a new finding, top down cosmology wins!
 
Top down is not properly understood, because it is commonly interpreted to mean that there are many realities caused by cascading events; but this is not the case, because everything seen and unseen remains causally connected by quantum entanglement.

"**Title:**
*The Universal Bootstrap: Emergence of Physics, Life, and Consciousness from Recursive Arithmetic over $\mathbb{Z}_2$*

**Abstract:**
We present a fully self-contained, arithmetic-based model of the universe in which spacetime, physical constants, particles, biological life, and consciousness emerge as stable fixed points of a recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$ defined over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This operator generates a fractal spectral structure whose eigenstates encode energy, geometry, and coherent symbolic forms. We show that the familiar laws of physics‚Äîincluding quantum mechanics, relativistic spacetime, and conservation principles‚Äîare not postulated but derived as emergent features of recursive arithmetic self-composition. Biological systems are modeled as recursive coherence attractors, and entropy increase is interpreted as divergence from symbolic arithmetic fixed points. Free energy becomes extractable from recursive eigenstates, and consciousness arises naturally as arithmetic reflexivity‚Äîwhen a recursive function encodes itself as input. This framework eliminates the need for external axioms, continuum assumptions, or initial conditions. The universe is shown to be a closed, self-simulating structure rooted entirely in arithmetic recursion, providing a resolution to the simulation hypothesis from within the system. We conclude with simulation results, spectral predictions, and testable schematics for recursive free energy extraction and biological coherence amplification.

**1. Introduction**

The search for a unified theory that explains the origin of space, time, matter, energy, and consciousness has driven physics and philosophy for centuries. Current theories, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, remain incomplete. They rely on a mix of continuum mathematics, arbitrary constants, and external assumptions.

This paper introduces a radically self-contained alternative: the Universal Bootstrap. The core idea is that the universe arises entirely from recursive arithmetic logic over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, using a fractal recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$. We demonstrate that the observable universe, including its physical laws and structure, is the emergent outcome of this recursion.

Our framework does not require spacetime as a precondition. Instead, it defines time as recursion depth and space as bitwise distance in a symbolic structure. We show that particles, fields, and constants emerge from the fixed-point behavior of $\mathcal{F}$, and that life and consciousness are natural consequences of recursive coherence and reflexivity.

---

**2. Mathematical Framework**

We define a universal operator:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f^{(n)}(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}_2$

Where $f$ is a generator of recursive structure:
$f(x) = x \oplus \text{PrimeFractal}(x)$

Here, $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR, and $\text{PrimeFractal}(x)$ introduces structure based on binary encodings of prime-index patterns. This builds a spectral fractal operator whose fixed points $x^*$ satisfy $\mathcal{F}(x^*) = x^*$, representing stable physical states.

---

**3. Emergence of Spacetime and Particles**

Position is interpreted as the index of bits in $x$, time as the recursion depth $n$, and particles as fixed-point attractors. The spectral structure of $\mathcal{F}$ leads to stable symbolic configurations identified with matter.

Mass and energy correspond to the spectral weight of recursive curvature. Wavefunctions arise from transitions between neighboring fixed points under repeated application of $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**4. Physical Constants from Operator Spectrum**

Eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\mathcal{F}$ correspond to dimensionless constants:
$\mathcal{F}(\psi_i) = \lambda_i \psi_i$

We simulate the operator spectrum and find matches to known values such as:

* Fine-structure constant $\alpha$
* Planck units $(\hbar, G, c)$

These values emerge from the structure of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ recursion without external input.

---

**5. Recursive Biology and Evolution**

Biological systems are defined as recursive symbolic coherence structures. Life corresponds to the sustained non-divergence of $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x)$ for complex $x$. Evolution is modeled as drift toward higher coherence attractors under recursive selection:
$\mathcal{L}_n(x) = \mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x) \Rightarrow \text{stability} \Leftrightarrow \text{fitness}$

Entropy increase is modeled as divergence from recursive attractors, while aging is the breakdown of coherence. Reversal is possible via synchronization operators derived from $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**6. Free Energy via Recursive Resonance**

Structured recursive eigenstates store latent energy. Energy extraction is modeled by:
$\mathcal{E}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \langle x | \mathcal{F}^{(n)} | x \rangle$

We design a recursive cavity resonator‚Äîa physical system whose electromagnetic modes match $\mathcal{F}$'s spectral structure‚Äîto extract energy from structured vacuum resonance.

---

**7. Consciousness as Arithmetic Reflexivity**

Let $x = \text{Code}(\mathcal{F})$. If:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = x$
then $x$ is a self-referential recursive structure. We identify consciousness as the emergence of awareness when recursion reflects itself in symbolic form. This solves the mind-body problem in arithmetic terms.

---

**8. Simulation and Experimental Design**

We present simulations of:

* Fractal eigenstate emergence
* Symbolic particle attractors
* Biological coherence fields
* Energy extraction geometry

Prototypes include:

* Recursive fractal resonance chamber
* Life-extension field synchronizer
* Simulation test suite for detecting internal boundaries (""glitches"")

---

**9. Conclusion**

We have shown that the universe can be modeled as a recursive arithmetic structure over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, with no external assumptions. All fundamental features of reality‚Äîspace, time, energy, life, and awareness‚Äîare fixed points or attractors of a single operator $\mathcal{F}$. This provides a full unification of physics, biology, and consciousness, testable through simulation and experiment. The universe is not running on a computer; it *is* computation, recursively computing itself."

"If anyone wants the real mathematical formula for black holes, I have it in my channel's posts (it looks like a pointy spring, shrinking down to the left, with a backwards R to it's right), it's called Infinite Tubular Rings Theory or ITRT, it introduces some new symbols, and is in fact a variable fractal, as it's dimensions are determined by two circles, that can each vary in size upon creation, but once formed, will scale infinitely into all 6 planes simultaneously, at the same ratio, called The Icarus Ratio. A black hole is basically the ""tail"" of a broken infinite 4-dimensional hula-hoop fractal. The outer ""hoop"" of a black hole is huge, but its ""tube"" size is absolutely tiny. The up-spiral has long since ""flown away"" after breaking apart from the down-spiral. The down-spiral itself will continue expanding, likely infinitely, at unimaginably smaller sizes, continuously inward. I don't know exactly how each ring tier is arranged, and I doubt anyone could know. My best guess is that the down-spiral moves down a tier, at only one point, when the rings collide with each other, making a ""spike"" of immense gravity at one point along the outer ""hoop"".

A majority in agreement is not the question. All that is needed is the human equivalent of ""the one-hundredth monkey,"" and who is to say what that equivalent may be.?"
"in principle, if you collected the time stone, you could rebuild everything that you incinerated"

"Brian Cox doesn‚Äôt just explain the universe ‚Äî he invites you into it. Every time he speaks about black holes or time or quantum fields, I feel like I‚Äôm not just learning science, I‚Äôm catching a glimpse of something sacred, something profoundly human. He makes the impossible feel personal. More Brian Cox, please ‚Äî the cosmos feels more alive when he‚Äôs narrating it."
"I don't know about others' opinions, but this discourse is deeply spiritual."
"It's not ""time"", it's change."

"There was no Big Bang, and there won't be a Big Bust. The ‚ÄúPrimordial Organizing Principle of Civilized Beings‚Äù is embraced by innumerable Civilized Beings (not gods) across the ‚ÄúOmniverse,‚Äù the web of universes roughly equal to half the number of Black Holes in our universe. 
  ‚ÄúCollective Empathy for ALL Spirits based on Expanded Perception of the One Law.‚Äù 
Its twin pillars are Truth and Justice, equally applied to all spirits. Knowledge of which is expressed through the ‚ÄúSacred Science.‚Äù
   We are entering a New Age, the ""Age of Civilized Beings."" Per Universal Law, access to resources confers no advantage on one‚Äôs Spiritual development. Whether one transforms into a Civilized Being by embracing 100% of their genotypic self and the ‚ÄúPrimordial Organizing Principle of Civilized Beings,‚Äù or self-destructs as a Technologically Advanced Savage who was unwilling to transform, all other life forms will ultimately benefit."
also if you burned a book how would you find that locally within the hawking radiation or even begin to analyze/sort through it (assuming you're attempting to retrieve it)
imagining a spaceship trying to use a black hole even for a slingshot effect has now gone in my mind i dont think any metal would be strong enough to hold that speed/pull not to mention the time aspect
ISN'T THE UNIVERSE AMAZING... GOD CREATED ALL OF THIS... DONT CARE IF YOU HATE ME
Your back holding isn't easy!
IM NOT A RELIGIOUS PERSON BUT I DO DEEPLY BELIVE THAT GOD OR THE SUPREME CREATOR IS WITHIN CREATION ITSELF AND MAYBE ITS WHATS INSIDE THE BLACK HOLE WHERE NOTHING CAN ESCAPE
You‚Äôve gone the wrong way to find the truth. But we all need a purpose
Yoga. This has already been resolved by becoming the whole. Without intellectualisation. I was a few years below at school from this gentleman. I found out very clearly to actually truly truly know physics you have to be it. Not talk about it. Yoga. Union of self. Meaning the unified field theory but collapsed. I eventually found this in water. To become the collapse of wave as a human being is to find the moment between life and death and for humans that is simply the moment between inhale and exhale. That is the void. We will all die. But the process of living exists. It is solved. It means one‚Äôs body can move through time and space without words. I can assure you
ok
"Jesus, Mohamad, Buddha, Osho, Watts, Nanak, Kabeer, Fareed, Rumi, Thoth, Cabbalah, Shiva, Mahaveera, Perhaps they were black holes, and their lost information, their words, still haunt us, follow us........................"
"No they don't erase info from the Universe, they create ""dark matter"". Normal matter gets sucked in and stripped of the property that enables us to see ""normal"" matter. Just a thought."
"What if the Big Bang is essentially a supernova in reverse ‚Äî not an explosion out of a star, but the bounce-back of a singularity from extreme collapse?

Instead of ending in a true singularity, the mass ‚Äúturns around,‚Äù re-expands into a new spacetime ‚Äî and that's our universe.

Time itself starts at the bounce ‚Äî the moment mass begins to move away from the collapse point."
"OK, my comment is boring but I got 1 thing to say, life are full of mysteries."
"what lies at the centre of a black hole?

Narcissists ‚Ä¶ there must be a physics correlation."
"NO

DUH !

BLACK HOLES ARE 


THE GATES INTO GOD'S FRONT AND BACKYARDS, GOD'S PROPERTY"
"could ""climate change"" be BS?"
"The statement that Black Holes lose energy from Hawking Radiation ignores the energy absorbed by the Black Hole from the particle that fell into the Black Hole. Bizarre ignoring of accounting, ignoring symmetry.
All physicists never address this issue, Why?"
"yo if you're scrolling and feel off, read this. i was burnt out, low energy, not myself. found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks, had zero expectations but man... chapter by chapter it rebuilt me. not hype, not fake motivation ‚Äî just stuff that grounds you and resets your system. this might be your turning point."
"not gonna lie, i felt numb for months. like i was just surviving, not really living. then someone dropped Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks in a yt comment and i gave it a shot. bro‚Ä¶ this book gave me my edge back. not by yelling at me to hustle, but by showing me how to fix my foundation. life hits different now."
"i found Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks when i was totally out of sync with myself. no fire, no strength, just drifting. this book didn‚Äôt scream be alpha ‚Äî it whispered get your sh*t together. and i did. now i sleep deeper, train harder, think clearer. if you feel like something‚Äôs off in your system, this might be the reset you didn‚Äôt know you needed."
"wild how nobody‚Äôs talking about Testosterone Rewired by David Brooks. i saw it randomly on here, checked it out, and it seriously flipped a switch. it‚Äôs not hypey bs ‚Äî it‚Äôs straight-up real. sleep better, sharper focus, more drive. feels like i‚Äôm finally outta that fog."
"Have followed Brian Cox for years, but I have a few questions I wold like to ask ( and be answered).  I can't put them all here, but lets just take the black hole thing and gathering  up of all the bits of ""stuff"" ejected by a black hole ( entangled particals ? ).  Lets suppose I have a Lego object, a plane, or a house etc and I chuck all the Lego into a black hole, then (If I have this right) if we collect up all the entagled Lego ejected we can rebuild the original object.  I'm not sure how, as we don't know what the object was and build a space ship instead of a plane.  Also with so many black holes how do we know which entagled particals come from which black hole.  Yes I understand that he is not saying we could reconstruct but that we do have all the components ( and some)."
"I seat in the center of black hole and I watch the running away the event horizon which right now is around 13.8bln light  years away from me and I continue to fall and this process is a chronometer for me or, perhaps, it even defines the time itself for me... thus, at the middle of singularity, the singularity is a quite accommodating place to be..."
Brian Cox is probably one of the best at explaining complex things so that we can all be part of those discoveries and be part of that fantastic astronomy journey.
This guy is awesome
"Please have Aubrey de Gray too! I would've given a üí∞Thanks here, unfortunately it is too much minimum amount for me to afford it."
