Well that was a pointless watch
No dress sense here.
"How about using JWST to check out “Tabby’s Star”? Supposedly, it has a range of 13.5 BILLION light years. If so it should be a very simple answer to be discovered, unless there is something they don’t want us to know like, JWST doesn’t work and was a waste of money, OR maybe, just maybe, astronomy itself is a waste of money, that could be used to actually help people on this planet."

"A ""Dyson sphere"" is the dumbest astrophysics hypothesis in all of human history. As for this particular star, ""We don't know what is going on, but we're working on finding out,"" is sufficient. 

Maybe it's a fleet of space-busses taking extraterrestrial ""children"" to space-school, and the long pauses between events are Spring and Summer Break? 

That's at least as good a hypothesis as a Dyson sphere."
"The theory of Dyson spheres is at best absurd, at worst, ludicrous.
To think that a civilisation capeable of constructing a mega structure around it's star to capture energy,
Would endeavour to do so, while other forms of limitless energy would be available to that advanced civilisation,
Is plain silly.
We, here, now, are on the verge of fusion energy, limitless cheap energy,
Other more exotic energy will be available within the next one hundred years.
The mere construction around a star would probably use all of the material from dozens of planets, the length of construction measured in thousands of years,
Whatever planets remained in those solar systems would see dramatic, maybe even catastrophic falls in sunlight, weather pattern carnage, and eco systems collapse.
Dyson spheres are nonsense."
"Some time ago a telescope observed something taking energy from our sun and there was many hypotheses commentary about that, is the only thing we can do about until nobody remembers the event it’s sad but…"
"""Anything that uses a lot of energy produces a lot of heat"" is mentioned 11:04. But this isn't always the case—it depends on how efficiently the energy is converted into the intended form of work.

For example, electric heaters are designed to convert electrical energy directly into heat, so nearly all the energy becomes heat. However, LED lights or electric motors are much more efficient: they convert most of the energy into light or motion, respectively, with minimal heat loss. So while energy usage often correlates with heat production, the relationship depends on the efficiency and purpose of the device."

"She's comfortable suggesting alien tech waaaaaay out there, but glides easily over our moons' creation with the common (flawed) hypothesis.

When I was a child I thought aliens would look like monsters until I realized we are aliens to everyone else in the universe.we are not the only human beings in the universe if you think we are that lucky you are just selfish!
"For those who is skeptical about science, I must tell you something about science that you must unquestionably believe, that is science has always been proven wrong later on.  You can always believe that about science."
Im the most simple star thats why u cant see it❤❤🎉🎉
And this only picks up planets that are perfectly or near perfectly in alignment with earth and their sun!  This is only a slice in an endless cake.  Imagine all the ones that don't align!  Exponentially more exist
Couldn`t it simply be a giant planet with enormous moons orbiting it?
"All of you are a joke you make up something and run with it. Black energy, black matter, white holes. Stop with the lies. My all time favorite is the big bang. None of this is real. But you keep making money with your lies."
Is there any update subsequent to the JWST going into service?
"I find it cute, as if an ant colony witnessed their first snowflake and the top scientist ants tell the others what it is as if they should know because... they are the top scientist ants. I myself am not any kind of scientist, but I do have great vision and imagination."
"Too long: strange patterns, many volunteers, in the end it's not aliens, they don't know what it is. And she is a bad speaker, weird pauses, bad tone, and in the end very little information."
"Earth is not eleven times smaller than Jupiter, its diameter is 11 times smaller. Very different things."
"Well, how about huge comet passed in between that star and earth but the comet is very far from that star that would abstruct great chunk of light from that star"
My guess is the star is in a trinary star system with two black holes
What if the readings were about multiple planets aligning in the line of sight of our Kepler telescope🧐
It's an amazing story
This is NOT a worthy TED talk.  She admitted that she didn’t know what was causing the phenomenon and then goes on and on with her unsubstantiated theories.  Boo 😒 hiss.  🐍
"Just some gas clouds passed the star, boring."
"Prolly another solar system

The light is the sun there, & the light dips are the different planets eclipsing our view of the sun there"
"So, this passes for science?  Since when does TED Talks allow science fiction?"
"If the planets resources are exhausted, where did the resources for a Dysons  sphere come from? Mining other planets?"
She sounds like she makes ambrosia salad without any raisins 😬
"How do you build a Dyson Sphere ""after"" you ""exhaust the energy supply of your home planet"" ?  And if you are so advanced that you know how to build a Dyson Sphere, how did you fail to only rely on reusable energy to avoid the need to build a Dyson Sphere in the first place?"
I would rather focus on what is with in me😂
What if Tabby orbits a black hole? or is it slowly being eaten?

when will these aliens will contact to me?? i mean i am hearing too much alien shts for decades from these fantasy scientists
Yeah okay...aliens...sure...smh
Point Webb at it
"Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the star's large irregular changes in brightness, but as of 2024, none of them fully explain all aspects of the resulting light curve."
"A lot of you're probably wondering why does she look so familar. Well she has uncanny resemblance to Matt Servitto (Deputy Brock in Banshee, Gov. Bob Sweeney in the Billions).
You're welcome."
"Has anyone considered the possibility that this star has multiple planets and some of them cross the star at the same time causing more sunlight to be blocked and also extending the length of time that the light of blocked as well as the irregular dipping of the lights?  Even in our solar system we have planetary alignment.  Perhaps these alignments occur more frequently on that system, perhaps that star has maybe 20 planets orbiting it and perhaps they are not as far apart from one and other as our planets are."
not at all interested in the hypothetical after opening my that Carl quote
"So you are telling me that all these scientists and those 300,000 science enthusiasts could not think of the simple possibility that multiple planets could be passing in front of that star (not necessarily orbiting it) just by chance? I mean you are looking at a star so far away you can barely see the light of it, there can be so many other celestial objects passing in front of it and all you can think of is ""alien megastructures""... I wonder how many real scientist are out there these days and not just a bunch of nerds with PHDs..."
Why can you not show the solar system as it really is??!!
And all this from nothing.....😉
Alien 👾 alert 🤯
What a bimbo
Is the star dying?
I'm not an Astronomer but what if there was more than one planet orbiting the Star but at different speeds? Only on occasions would the planets coincide and act in unison to block more significant amounts of light.
"See no reason to go to alien intelligence to explain this.  More likely the occlisions are from a multitude of planets, both large and not so large, all in the same plane perpendicular to us.  Their periods of rotation vary as does their size, but periodically several, or even half a dozen, eclipse our sight line near simultaneously, over a few days, a week...a few months.  Probably hard to model a planetary system with a dozen Jupiter sized planets, but still easier than invoking alien technology?"
"The ancient word for this is STARBINDER , scientist in our time call it a Dison Sphere"
"Stop wasting our taxes looking to land on Mars or the moon. For what purpose? other than to support 100,000 people who waste their talent on the moon or Mars landing, when they can solve problems here on Earth, we have so many."
You are looking at a light show on the underside of the solid dome that is over our heads. The solid dome is a few hundred miles above us.

8 years later.. any update on this info?
"The star in question is almost 1,500 light years away from Earth. At that distance, planetary celestial bodies could be causing the dimming. And this star's by no means the only star which experiences dimming in brightness."
Occam’s razor tells me it’s just a bunch of rubble bouncing around after a couple of planets collided. It’s a boring explanation but it’s more likely than an alien war let’s face it.
They debunked it. It was dust doing all that dimming.
If it was alien structures the patterns would occur on a regular basis which they are not.  So... logic will  prevail for most people.
"To create a dysonsper,  you would need more then one plants resorts."

The problem may be assumptions : laws of physics are universal.
As for 2024 -  8 years any further information?
"Independently from these findings, I am totally convinced that there is life everywhere in the universe."
What about multiple Jupiter size planets around this star
I was just about to watch this. Almost forgot about ted (i'll look it up someplace else)
I hope we never find aliens.  Given what happens when we found new populations of humans on this world such an encounter does not bode well for us or them.

What if the dip is caused by dense cold dust and gas between earth and the star?  That’s the most reasonable explanation.
"What a waste of money and time, just shows the incompetence of your scientists"
What news on that star now? Have they solved the puzzle yet?
Is that Louis theroux in the audience at 4.10
"Anybody clear my doubt!  How come distant planetary system we observe, we are able to detect the planet, which is orbiting around the distant star, we are aligned with that means earth, the distant planet and distant star? Means we are at point where far stars or planets are above or below our view point. And some might come into our alignment!
Scientist observe star and measure the light coming from it and the difference they detect shows some planet or something is revolving around it. My question is how come we are always aligned with far far away star system?"
Could it be a three star system in which one of the stars emits much less light than the others?
Begs the question: if the alien planet had exhausted their planets energy - where would they get the enormous amount of energy it would take to build a structure around a Sun?
"The cause of the dimming could be something not close to the star but much closer to us.
A wandering planet. Several wandering planets."
Perhaps we are witnessing the interaction of dark matter on a star system.
"anyone ever calculate the time, materials and energy a dyson sphere would take to construct? and where to source those? and maintain? i find the science fascinating but please dont discredit it with that pseudo science."
"Astronomy should be a regular subject in Elementary,  at least twice, from First to Sixth Grades.  Just like Music also should.

But of course,  I'm now diverting from Astronomy and this may be too much for some of you..."
Every time i go to watch this I fall asleep. I think its because she starts off pretty much saying she'll return to aliens. That isnt interesting. It isnt even close to interesting. It's the opposite. So im watching it this morning hoping the ending isnt silly af

"Imo, I would think that if a civilization had the technology to make a Dyson Sphere, they'd be able to produce a fusion energy device. The fusion device uses much less material, and would be easy to compartmentalize and tap into.  I'm trying to accept the Dyson Sphere theory but find it illogical."

"I read that old photographic, astronomical plates taken in the last 100 years from the same area of the sky, including this star show gradual dimming of this star. That implies that if it's really an alien mega structure, the building of a Dyson Sphere is in progress for a long time!"

"Heres a question. If something so big needed to be built because the  planet used all their engery, where did the engery come from to build such a large structure?

"Sorry but this is not Science, its Science Fiction. I support citizen scientists and amateur astronomy, but the fact that she could write a paper and have it accepted with things like space battles and Dyson Spheres as explanation is just proof to me that our journal system is corrupt. Her explanations are simply outside dogmas, and thus, as crazy as they are, are accepted. But you get some other theory for a phenomenon that has heavy Dogma ( _intellectual phase locking_ ) and you get nothing but rejections and worse, career suicide."
"""Even alien mega structures cannot defy the laws of physics"". That's something you can't know. At this time, with so much UFO evidence to the contrary. I don't know what UFO's are. But, they violate the laws of physics ad easily as you & I take a drink of water.

"If our hypothetical aliens, i.e. those of the hypothesis Tabetha thinks the less likely one, are or were living on or in a solid planet, chances are that the interior of the planet, like our own, has or had a vast amount of hyper-fossilized collapsed supernova, the stuff that is responsible for our roughly 4500 million years of Earth's existence. Admittedly, they'd need to use that sort of thhing to build Dyson spheres, but it's hard to believe it'd be worth it."
Any update now that JWST is up and running?
"Suppose one planet was blocking the view of one or more plantes as it began to cross in front, and then the other planets emergered into view , this could explain the fluxuation as some planets with tighter orbits could orbit at much faster time wise ?"
"At the moment when there was talk of the possibility of a very advanced civilization, which, however, cannot manage nuclear fusion and is therefore dependent on the radiation of nuclear fusion from the central star, the curtain fell on me inwardly and the show was over.
At least the passage of large debris fields / comet accumulations that was mentioned before was still reasonably plausible. The rest of the alien tech was too much nonsense for me personally ..."
"It does seem very simple to explain and it certainly does not involve 
1. Aliens
2. Star Wars - Death Stars etc
3. Asteroid belts or 
4. Black holes 
The strange pattern shown in the video of the Kepler effect is because we on earth are observing the planetary object passing the star in an elliptical orbit north to south travelling towards us.  The other Kepler observations will be objects passing the same star at different elliptical orbits therefore creating smaller dips as they appear to pass more quickly to us as observers. 
I am certain that the results would be entirely different if observed from anywhere else except earth."

BRETHEN MOONS!!! We need to stay away. It's the CONVERGENCE event happening over there.

"So, here's the big question - what kind of shockingly poor computer programming is involved is order to miss those multiple, MASSIVE (compared to the baseline) drops in signal?? The non-uniformity (as a massive 'clue') SHOULD also have been detected by that same 'search' programming.
--> Honestly, there is some serious questions to be asked about this, and makes us wonder at the overall 'quality' of the science being undertaken here.

Additionally...
1) The 'observable' universe is currently believed to be around 93 billion light years across. This is what we can 'see' from Earth or from our space telescopes.
2) The entire universe is currently believed to be around......wait for it...........9.................TRILLION light years across."

"All we are able to see is a drop of water in the entire ocean
That cannot be the only mysterious star in the entire ocean.

"Too many natural explanations.  A Saturn like gas giant with large rings and perhaps a rotational ""wobble"" making the planet itself seem to increase and decrease in size due to the orientation of the rings between us and the star.  An asteroid belt that would put our own asteroid belt to shame, out near the range of Pluto.  Huge clumps of planets/asteroids causing irregular shifts in light getting through.  I like this better than the comet theory, though it's a similar explanation...  just random debris, although very large debris.  Random large debris causing seemingly random large fluctuations.  

Or, instead of our system which has 8 planets, this system has 140.  Many of these planets have lined up and have similar orbits.  Like Pluto and Charon, many are more like co-planets than a main planet with moon(s).  Their revolutions with each other cause rapid fluctuations in what seems to be the size of only one massive planet.  And so on.  

Either that or the Death Star theory.  🙄"

It's amazing how with all the stuff out there that nobody knows anything about but we have found the most mysterious star.
"Observation 1 . There is an unimaginable actual tangible distance between us and this star with countless objects ,smaller than the resolution and sampling in the analogue /digital optical  lens processor of Kepler. The aggregate of these objects  can eventually create random clean and noisy transition signatures. 
Observation 2 . Remember that  we are looking at a tiny, less than a fraction of space , and so this pattern will be repeated else where just by statistical calculation  .  
Observation 3 : Large bodies orbiting other stars can create transition shadows  as Kepler can not digitally distinguish the x.y,z axis  profile of that space  block  at that distance using 'one axis 'of reference and relative observation. Even with Kepler orbit, this reference positioning  for data acquisition needs to be extended by distance factor of x100 in all x,y,z planes to get more accurate data.    
Although its good to recognise a pattern its impossible to link any assumptions of Alien existence at this stage.  We observe an anomaly to the 'typical' we can say."

"No matter what has caused this anomaly i look forward to finding the answers.  Hope it is found in my time.😊🌏
No matter how much we know there is always more to know. 🌠"
I almost finished this video but it seemed too much like BS so I'm done.
"Oh no, ANOTHER MOST MYSTERIOUS STAR ! ! ! !"
How about twin planets revolving around each other?
not Dyson sphere again  😴
"Thank god for nerds, they make the world better for everyone"
Interesting that earth orbit is blinded by the sun. Like it's hiding.
And just like that people went from being self taught virologists to self taught astronomers.
The citizen is the key.  They are from this star system and know every answer about it.  They purposely gave the info to the egg heads to screw with them and distract them.
Life is a simulation so who cares!
I think it was Jesus
"This aged very badly, but then again, most of these get blown out of proportion by media, not so much by scientists.  It's cool sci-fi tho."
"Those scientist and their arrogance... ""Most mysterious ... in the universe."" Hardly. Only most mysterious among the very very infinitely few that we know about."
All this speech just to say that found something we don't know about. TED talks should be more than that...
Science is messy.   And that is the way it is supposed to be.
"These mega-structures are by the way not called Dyson spheres. A Dyson sphere is a solid shell around a star, there would be no light reaching the earth, and we wouldn´t even know that there is a star. The kind of mega-structure she´s talking about is called a Dyson swarm.

The civilization building this swarm also wouldn´t necessarily need to be that far ahead of ours. We could already build Dyson swarms theoretically, we just have problems with the amount of material needed, but no Dyson swarm is built in a day, we could already start to build our swarm, panel by panel."
"Has anyone considered multiple planets, transiting at close to the same time?"
Could it be possible that the lack of symmetry shown in the graph is the result of a very large object being slowed down (to enter orbit? ) and then showing a different reading as it gained enough speed to reach escape velocity?
"Asteroid belt? Not around the star necessarily, but between us and that star??"
"Pity, she could have made a good talk about what specific heuristics NASA's software was written to detect, vs. how the public access ended up detecting.  BUT NO, she had to fill the talk with lame jokes and B$  about how computers can't detect patterns like this, about silly theories that never had any basis in the evidence, things that could be disproven in seconds from even conceiving them.  Really, this is the worst TED talk I've ever seen, and she's one of the worst public talkers I've ever seen as well."
"Its never Aliens, until Prooven =/"
"NASA didn't find any Galaxy, Nebula, Milkyway Galaxy, Andromeda Galaxy and others. Not true! Everyone became Astronomer, Scientists whatever. In NASA there are too many empty heads acting and dancing around. Tabetha should stop copying and following NASA's lies."
they've proven it was just moving in a straighter trajectory towards the observation point. no biggie.
"It could be a planet,moon,possibly a comet or asteroid being destroyed onto the Sun in there own solar system."
If aliens have a same brain as people in our planet better never find them
Maybe use the JWST to see what is going on….
may be aliens mobilizing their artillery spaceships which are extremely huge
First rule of astronomy: it’s never aliens.
"THE UNIVERSAL, BALANCED, INTEGRATED, EXTENSIVE, IRREFUTABLE, CLEAR, SIMPLE, AND TOP DOWN MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA (ON BALANCE):

It is a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience.

What is gravity is an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked ON BALANCE. Great.

TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ! Great. Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE !! Great. Consider the tides in relation to what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky ON BALANCE. HALF of the view of WHAT IS THE EARTH is BLUE (ON BALANCE) when the Pacific Ocean is then SEEN in full VIEW. 

E=MC2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE.

Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/AS) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

NOW, carefully consider what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who is standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. Very carefully consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. (LOOK up at what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky, AS THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE.) CLEAR water comes from what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. Objects AND MEN fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Consider what is THE EYE. So, LOOK at what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON AND what is the orange (AND setting) Sun ON BALANCE. Now, think about what is LAVA. E=MC2 IS F=ma. SO, we then multiply ONE HALF times one half in order to determine the size of the Moon. (It IS about one fourth the size of the Earth.) This is CONSISTENT with the fact that the Moon IS (on balance) LAND. Therefore, the density of THE SUN is (ON BALANCE) about ONE FOURTH of that of what is THE EARTH; AS E=MC2 IS then CLEARLY proven to be F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. Again, it all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!

The BULK DENSITY of the Moon is comparable to that of (volcanic) basaltic LAVAS on the Earth. The energy density of LAVA IS about THREE TIMES that of water. SO, now, get a good and CLEAR LOOK at what is the ORANGE SUN !!! We WOULD then multiply ONE THIRD times one half in order to obtain the surface gravity that is experienced by the man on the Moon. (It IS one sixth of that of the man who is on the Earth.) The maria (""lunar seas"") on the Moon do take up ONE THIRD of what is the near side of the Moon. Excellent. The Moon is ALSO BLUE on balance. Great !!! Now, in conclusion, the land surface area of THE EARTH is 29 PERCENT; AND this is EXACTLY ON BALANCE WITH BOTH one third AND one fourth; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY F=ma !!!!! GOT IT !!! GREAT.

E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY proven to be gravity ON BALANCE. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. It must be, and it is.

A star with some form of accreditation disc makes the most sense. Where would a civilization get the raw materials needed for a Dyson sphere?
"Polaris is stationary and situated vertically above the North Pole. The sun, moon and stars are concentric to Polaris. The stars move as one mass. 🤔  My star is more mysterious than yours because Polaris remains stationary as it seemingly hitches a ride with earth as it revolves around the sun. Extraordinary !! I win because my ""astronomy"" is far superior. Best down in progress. Maybe I should publish my findings too. 😆 Have the stars changed their position relative to each other in recorded history? No. I will put that in my findings that I publish."
ive never heard such a rambling mess. what on earth is she trying to say. and why is titled the way it is...when she barely talks about it.

the distances are a lie. lord steven christ revealed it all. you really think gravity magically makes people on a globe appear like they are walking upright? LMAO
"""I want to reiterate that we should not assume that anything or everything weird is aliens..

even though observable data says otherwise.
And going with the Dyson sphere model (uber -gigantic rigid structure)instead of the more realistic Dyson swarm(millions of smaller satellites), which would be 1000x easier to do, but a lot less dramatic.

How could a Dyson sphere withstand a star's gravity?
Surprised it wasnt suggest that it is actually a planet in another nearby solar system that is crossing the path of this star.
what about a few clusters of planets around this star   one bigger then the other   is there a limit a star can have???? NO          so think about a few cluster of planets with the same speed and size     problem solved   in 10 seconds thank you
Kepler just detects the planets lined up in the earth’s direction. Imagine how many planets there really are.
"Why are a ""natural phenomenon we don't understand"" and ""possible life on other planet"" mutually exclusive? And why would the latter be given any less credence?"

What would the data say about Sol from face on of the ort cloud from the same distance?
"How do we know the dip is caused by just one object? We don't. It could be a set of objects. We are just looking at shadows cast across light years, so anything in between can block the light. We need an open mind. Where was Joy Behar standing at the time, for example?"

Is someone keeping you busy watching worthless videos that can be so easily explained it’s ridiculous turning multiple heavy asteroid belts into Alien tech to make money and see how gullible you are all at the same time.  Good job hopelessly dumb gay TED
Can it be a black hole or a developing black hole bending the light perhaps? Or a cold companion dwarf star?  Its a good candidate for the James Webb apparatus. Hopefully its on the JW team's agenda.
I still think the earth is flat
Whatever the conversation. I'm here to talk about Einstein's theory of everything. He was correct you just didn't hear or see what he was saying. Light is constant but Mass is instant. They are not separate from each other. They move as one. It's the speed of scale that you're not relating to with his formula.12/30/2022.
"Trinary system, two very small black holes of an unexpectedly small size and a star, orbits are far apart, all are gravitationally influenced by the others. When the transit of the star is behind one or more of the black holes relative to its position from earth the light diminishes.  That is my best guess."
It's a Binary Star system...one of the Stars is a Brown Dwarf...
"Scientists keep saying 'more advanced"" when what they actually mean is 'more technologically advanced', which us something profoundly different. It betrays a fundamental belief that progress has only a single technology based vector. I'm desperately waiting for humankind to outgrow its juvenile obsession with technological trinkets.

"If you are an alien race thousands or millions of years more advanced than us, then you already know how to create anything from the fabric of space itself,  did i state something that even science doesn't know yet. But wait there is much more that is about to be exposed."
"I’m not even going to listen to this because it’s got such a stupid title:  “The most mysterious star in the universe”.  It’s a ridiculous title because we can’t possibly know that unless we’ve examined EVERY star in the Universe - and we obviously haven’t.  If it had been called “The most mysterious star we’ve discovered” - I would have watched and I’m sure I would have enjoyed it - but this title is so stupid I’m just going to click “thumbs down” and go on with my day.  But before that, maybe I should declare this to be “The absolute worst video title in Social Media” - because I have more evidence of that that statement than they have on their stupid star."
"First step in science when you find an anomaly. Question your data then question your instrument, then your process.  The last so called discovery wan nothing more that one telescope in the set giving bad readings. when removed all data was as before a non event.  If its not circular then 2 or more planets in simultaneous transit make a hot dog. Data all over? corrupted data or one of the planets was destroyed and the debris field is large or simply closer to the viewing location . ie. us. You do not need a solid object to block light.  there are always answers before ""aliens did it"""
Could the variation in light be caused by internal causes like fusion reactions which absorb energy instead of emitting ? I don't know if synthesis of elements past Iron in the periodic table by fusion is endothermic ie energy absorbing instead of energy releasing
She's not a very handsome woman. A bit off-putting actually. Who can listen clearly when faced with such a speaker?
I would really love to see an update on where thinking about this star is today. What new evidence is there and what is the current thinking?
And the world's top scientists said the data were good.
How do you know exactly
Would something like this be how a planet being accepted into a new system would look like?
"So questions. Is there significant red shift?
 If this planet was shaped like Saturn on its side due to a spin. Because it doesn't have to be on the same plane in space.  

Could that block it out?  

Say you launched a solar array that's connectable and always faces the sun. 
This could explain density if it's not dense enough to cause that much blockage. You could start off with a design that is always expandable. The array could be expanded infinitely until it circles the planet. And then later connected upwards like knitting. 

4 way connectors would be all you need. No crazy sphere to start

Edit: this would add redundancy in case of failures too."
"I think all of you are missing the point ( or enticement )  of the story, which is the possibility of ET lurking there. The juicy part of the presentation is the possibility of alien megastructures such as Dyson spheres. The fact is,  for any civilization to travel to stars they first need to develop fusion energy which makes the need for Star hugging for heat not needed and Dyson spheres obsolete. A star that is wobbling on its axis because of the effect of a near by blackhole can explain all the data, in my humble opinion."

Whatever is there is something rare in the galaxy. I'm guessing the telescopes can't see planets that aren't orbiting in the direction of earth?
Hey Liars! Over 50 years zero moon landig . You think  we all are so stupid!
"How about 2 or more very large orbiting planets, on different cycles perhaps distant from this star, each with one or more large moons also on different cycles ?   This provides varied and long-cycled light blocking to us, and which may only provide a discernable pattern of light loss after millions of years of human observation."
"Tabetha is using information from a Science FICTION Film. Aliens were living inside our Moon. They built our moon machine to survive.  A similar idea. She does not have any idea of the material they would have to use for a thousand times bigger than the earth. They really are desperate to keep the alien fiction alive and running with no consideration of some of the things needed for a habitable planet. 
Here are some things you need for a habitable planet. Right terrestrial planet • Stabilizing moon • Plate tectonics • Right atmosphere Right planetary neighbors • Right lone star • Right galaxy • Galactic location • Right cosmic time,  fine-tuned for life. Other discoveries since I last checked being made are also included. Don’t forget all these things have to be fine-tuned as are the laws of the universe."
The talk of alien super structures is fanciful to say the least
why not a black hole pass through the scope?
Of course aliens exist. Maybe not here on Earth but for certain elsewhere in Universe and probably all over the Galaxy. So since we are looking why is it so far fetched to believe we may have very well detected them?
What a freakin' honor to have a star named after you!!
"I'm from Jupiter
I can advance your Tech
If you like.
Find me"
"yeah, that started as a really interesting story and then they put the mad hat on. dyson sphere? srsly? have you ever calculated how much material you need to build something like that? you need whole planets for something like that. you can't build it in a week. and since the star is so far away, the ""civilization"" there has been dead for ages. in other words. this is bullshit."
"Meh. TED talks will let anyone on that stage now. Didn't used to be that way. Don't get me wrong. There are many qualified people on TED. But lately, anyone can be a TED. Watcher be aware of this. Just because a speaker  gets on TED, doesn't automatically mean they are sharing valid information."

hahahahahahaha
The other blips could be a moon orbiting the planet?
The earth moon event ok bye bye
Could be a black hole pulling in giant gas clouds and material somewhere in between earth and Tabby star.
Why wouldn't aliens be a natural explanation? If they exist they clearly are?
"Those comets are headed this way thus the reason behind the deep dip .
Read Revelations where it says the stars fall from the sky , the sun will not give light, the moon is discolored and there are earthquakes such as never has been before.
This is a demonstration of how we would quickly and easily rather reach for alien explanations than the hand of God whose explanations we actually have, and though we have it, it is far more fun and exciting to find the alien truth than God's existence. 
Yep, they appear as such and are baffling because those are headed this way.
Yep, yepper do

Ok since I'm on a science talk, I expect bashing, so come on....
Speaking scientifically though, I will say, just like if they hadn't brought in all those lay people to take a look they wouldn't have seen this, it is wrong to assume that the same laws of physics that govern our planet are the same for every other planetary object in all universes. To assume our scientists see everything and our computers can't be wrong was clearly a fallacy that once acknowledged led to this discovery,  I think that the same formula can be used to discover even more. It starts with being humble"
What if a black hole was passing in front of the star and you are mistaking it as a planet
Also important to note is if a stars Dilithium crystal activators were in remission it would only cause a 1/2 % dip in the earth's computer detection unit. Such as had happened at Romulus 5  in the Borg quadrant.. just saying....
"nope, just nope for aliens."
Is it Morris code? 😎🤯👽🤖💌
"couldn't it just be something like dark matter and why is comets not a good answer.

floating rocks in space seems quite common"
I saw the title and assumed this was going to be about Johnny Depp. What a pleasant surprise!
"what if...
all these ""planets"" are just ""local"" asteroids and other yet unknown objects
like dwarf planets, or the still hypothetic ""planet X"" in our solar system
dimming the light of stars?
could that happen too?"
"Per Wikipedia, in January 2021, a distant stellar-mass companion was reported, making Tabby's Star a binary stellar system."
And the law of physics I believe only works for earth bc they may have technology head of us that can bend time itself
What if it was not comets but a black hole rotating
Aliens look out in the ocean there here!
"I say, discount the idea of aliens and focus on pure natural science instead."
"If you consider the orbit times of all our planets, 4 years wouldn't possibly catch our transits. This system likely has multiple planets and they happen to to have orbits that create these dips. Quite possibly we caught it at the perfect time for two or three planets are transiting with even an asteroid belt blocking some light. I would say that there probable is life there, just not that advanced to harvest the power of the sun to that scale. You would likely make your home world and iceball."
I would rule out Dyson spheres for the simple fact that beings that were advanced enough to build such structures would have sourced alternate methods of energy creation well before exhausting their resources on such taxing mega structures. Makes for great science fiction though!
She really don't know. Like anyone else.
Mysterious indeed
"It was Carl Sagan that made NASA turn the camera around and take the famous ""blue dot"" picture from an extreme distance! And that some believes this ""Dot"" to be the center of all spiritual activity in the Universe, is rather absurd! It's compared to a sand particle on a beach!"
"Ah, the opposite of Occam's razor.  The solution is the one that is the most complex, univariable, and one requiring a super advanced civilization.  We just happen to be looking in its direction at the time of all the targets we could have selected.  Could also be that looking at any spot in the sky would yield looking at a Dyson being constructed.  But then noise or asteroids are not as interesting."
How could a planetary society build a structure billions of times the size of their construction material supply?
Something casted a shadow from a light
"Maybe the transiting object is planet with very many moons, say like Jupiter or Saturn but many more moons. Those moons could align so that they block out the light of the star very asymmetrically. Didn't those astronomers think of that?"
"I'm no scientist by any means, but could it be that the star just doesn't give off consistent light. The star itself could also be giving off some kind of plume that blocks the light. Oh, never mind, I will go back to my corner. You folks have a great next year."
"5.48 or it could be a black hole wondering around so prevent the stars light like that ??? is it possible.? Bec its not a regular planet, clearly right?"
I Want To Know
"Who was it said (or words like) , ""When you've excluded everything else, whatever you are left with, no matter how unlikely, has to be what youre facing"" .... 

Well Tabetha logically and scientifically excluded everything there.... except Aliens. Now Im not wearing a Tin Foil Hat , and Im extremely sceptical about Alien reports etc. Also, Ive considered there is one thing Tabetha didnt look at , basically because if true, she'd be a part of it, but whether or not this is all an elaborate hoax. So I considered that, with some friends Ive discussed this with, and we excluded that possibility because there would have to be way too many people that didnt know each other and stood to gain nothing - involved in the hoax. Its just not viable. It could also of course be a phenomonen in the universe we havent yet discovered / understand - so we couldnt discount that either.  

But like Tabetha , we could not sucessfully exclude Aliens , so far as to say, we struggled to accpet that it would be, surely not!. One thing that is for certain, and we need to remember here is whatever is being observed happened just under 1500 years ago because this star is just under 1500 light years from earth. So , if there are Aliens and they had constructed a Dyson spehere and maybe theyd been looking at us thousands of years ago... perhaps they may have thought, lets go take a look. They'd surely have the tech to do so (worm hole tech etc) , and just maybe, they have. 

 Mind blowing stuff indeed......"
"I guess it's unexplainable. Could be new phenomenon, something more baffling than a time curve or black hole. Ok."
"Reminded me that our faults - the limits to our wit - ain't in our stars , 
but ever in our unquestioned questions,   
which makes Minerva's minions meander between 
right answers to wrong questions/for the wrong reasons
and wrong answers to right questions/for the right reasons.

mmmm"
"What really happened was that the telescope lens cover broke and it blocked the light locationally.
 But the scientist were so ashamed that they turned this flaw into a master class."
"in short, we still don't know a fick about the universe. :p"
"""The data were good""
Well, I guess you didn't major in English, so I won't bust your chops on this one.
However, ""data"" is a set. ONE set. 
You should have said, ""The data was good"".
Carry on."
If a planet or groups of planets could build a Dyson sphere it would take millions of years to build.
This is even more scary than watching Exorcist
If my Scan button on my car stereo can miss a station than a super computer can miss a signal.
"So, you’re saying, it is aliens! 
Ok got it."
I really dont think this speaker is very good astronomer & likely a very amateur trying to work in a professionals world.
"This could easily be explained by the fact that the star could have many planets around it at varying distances that, during the weeks or months of these unusual blips, were aligned in a way to create these unusual blips. A single blip could have been created by two or more planets partially lined up, of different sizes, of course being at different distances from the star. This would easily create the unsymmetrical blip the scientist was talking about. The beginning of the blip being formed by a, for example, very large planet, partially lined up with one or several planets of highly differing sizes that would contribute to the middle and end of the blip.  I find it odd that this solution is not even explored in the talk. It seems to me highly unlikely that a star system would only have a single planet. Ours has eight or nine, depending on how you look at it, and when you include the objects in the Oort cloud, we could have hundreds of plantets."
"Fantasy, these scientists must go through a lot of weed."
So they cleaned it up with a space vacuum?
What a load of BS. This is just a cute story for more funding pitched to the gullible. TANFA (There Are No F#@king Aliens)
"Dyson spheres is IMO the dumbest concept I have ever heard.  Advanced civilizations would have nuclear fusion or some other small-scale technology to create near infinite energy, not create monstrosities requiring near infinite capital and resources to create that would take centuries to construct.  Yet somehow it has captured the imagination of a certain subset of clueless scientists."
"Even if it is Aliens we will never meet them Tabitha star is around1400 ly from earth! All we can do is listen and watch from here, keep in mind we are watching a potential extraterrestrial world 1400 years in the past so probably this Aliens are not even there anymore and if they're watching us right now and they have a very powerful telescope they are watching our civilization in the 7th century not very enticing to come visit us!🤣😅😆"
"These are the same scientists that think that people who have seen flying saucers are nutjobs. Yet it makes sense to them that aliens would make megastructures bigger than the Death Star, instead of going to another solar system. This solution is beyond crazy. The only reason why they can not even consider aliens visiting Earth is that they are visiting Earth. As far as the Aliens stay out there, anything is possible. If you see them here, you are a nutjob"
Completely B.S. God made the Universe and you are not smart enough to figure out how complex it is.
"Juveniles pretending to be astronomers & scientists, wasting millions of dollars & man hours!!!"
"I disagree vehemently! 

The most mysterious star today will be ""blaze in our memories"" the next time a stronger telescope is engineered. 

Title should be; ""another mysterious star""."
With that teaser title I expected her at least to sing .. .
Further investigation has shown the mystery is most likely just orbiting dust clouds. No aliens.

"Not one mention of possible reoccurring micronova. Even large solar flares will ""dim"" visible light output. The big solar flare of 2012 did just that. 

Id reckon we are looking more so towards the galactic center, the star is having reoccurring micronova outbursts. Or at least mega x class flares. 

On a side note, I don't think any aliens are building 25 million mile ling structures in space. That's 280 times the size of jupiter!!! At that point, just make a planet eating machine and just jump from solar system to solar system gathering resources. But what kind of species are they that they destroy their own world and then consume more? They would be worse than us humans. Think about it. They wasted their home planet, live in space  then somehow build mega structures to capture sunlight? Photons? Go eat planets or learn how to suck energy from the interplanetary magnetic connections. More energy there than we need and or that we could ever imagine."
"OMG.  Just because you don't know or have an explanation, doesn't mean you found little green men. It's a natural phenomenum. You need to come up with reasonable theory.

Couldn't it just be a large asteroid at a closer distance to the telescope between the telescope and the star?

Bottom line and results all point to the fact: Your guessing. No one knows what's going on in galaxy's thousands of light years away from us.
It is not the computers that miss it. It is the programmers who are so bad that they cannot program the computers to catch it.

"A large planet or dead star with moons could  produce the asymmetrical dip.  If it was massive relative to the bright star, they would be orbiting each other and the dips wouldn't necessarily be periodic. I'm pretty sure a computer could create such a scenario to fit the data."

"how about hundreds of planets circulating that star in in  a totally chaotic manner and not on a plane, some blocking the light in tandem and in obviously different orbits, creating shifts in the curves..."
In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth! That’s all I need to know! Creation demands a creator!
"This is a bunch of crap. A few non-periodic blips in the data and this woman is all confused. What could it be? Inquiring minds want to know!

A great mystery!
"Surely, to construct a 'Dyson Sphere' would require more matter than exists within an entire solar system, which would have to be transported from another system, many light years away, requiring more energy than could ever be captured by the 'sphere'. (as well as the obvious time problem)."
It would be hilarious if in reality there was a violent species out in space and the only thing that was keeping them from attacking us was the many years worth of movie broadcasts that show us beating every alien attack. 🤣

All this or Aliens. A cheap $50.00 bus ticket would have got u all the Aliens you wanted to see crossing the border
"I doubt any alien would ever make dyson spheres. Its just way to massive and sloppy way to get energy. Its like a medieval people thinking that in the future they will build a fire as big as a mountain to harness energy. No, its alot more likely that aliens will use something more advanced than nuclear technology to get energy. We already know that splitting the atom releases massive amounts of energy, so maybe aliens would split something even smaller than an atom and get even more energy."
Think it is all made up dribble.
"So it was comets then. Yes, it would take a massive amount of comets, which would be rare, hence why there is only one star that does this. Mystery solved."
Sounds like a target for the JWST.
James Webb telescope  🔭  ? ? ?
"I never thought the photometer would be able to detect this so accurately, I thought that it would be interfered with with all types of stray space signals and everything but it works perfectly"
It would seem to me that the most likely answer was a mix of planets and large asteroid fields.
pickups on earth have to be in line with these orbits from those earth systems are looking at!!
Yes We knew in October 2015 the megastructures werew Dyson spheres for harnessing the stars energy. Dimming light gave it away.
Their reasoning is flawed. This does not prove Dyson sphere. It could be multiple planets of similar size in orbit aligning.. Black. Hole in view distorting the light.
Its a job for JWST
Brilliant!!!
Sounds like American taxpayer funding should be directed from NASA to citizen astronomers.
hahahahahahhahahahahhahahahaha!
"She should be hired by Avengers Marvel to do an alien scenario for movie.  Oh, they did.

Point the Webb telescope there.
I’m glad Drew Barrymore decided to age naturally. Looks great.
It's an invasion fleet and it is coming this way.....
Could be a multi planetary system where the planets align in different formations as viewed by Kepler to create those effects.
"So, it's a computer program written by a fallible group of humans. Mistakes will be made. The most advantageous part of the learning experience is a mistake."
Where do they get the materials to build the Dyson structure?
soon as it became aliens using solar energy.. this was over.. advanced species wouldnt need solar energy much less the idea of them using dysons spheres.. why do humans always assume they can figure out the answer to everything and then also it has to go along with human invention.

"Why couldn't it be multiple planets in that solar system transiting relative to us? Planets here align all the time. It would be unusual but not unlikely that we just happen to be witnessing such transits, giving us some unusual data. And the huge dip could be a colossal planet further out in the system that transited. And perhaps the unusual drop on the left prior to the full dip was a second planet transiting fairly close to the main planet relative to where we're viewing it - not literally close. And perhaps some of the lengthy transits are highly elliptical orbits of some planets, also coincidentally relative to our viewing it. I'd buy something like that before alien mega-colossal structures. A Dyson's Sphere is a cool idea, but I'd really want to know how much energy input it would take before you got an ROI on your investment. I'm thinking thousands of years or more. I'm not talking money here, but energy. Wouldn't you need a planet's worth of material to build even a partial Sphere?"
Making a measurement once every half an hour seems to me to give a high chance of aliasing. You only need two large planets orbiting each other with a period of less than an hour for all sorts of weird results to be obtained.
"it would not be awsome if the aliens are blowing planets away , we don't need that kind of contact , aye !             😎"
"Where would all that material come from to build a Dyson sphere??? Unless the material is self-replicating or they mined every planet and asteroid in that solar system, would it still be enough to surround an entire sun???"

That was brilliant.
With advances in technology why would an advanced civilization need so much energy from their star to build such a huge object ... or need energy from any source other than cold fusion or ?  maybe a strange form of distorted lens gravity effect has caused incorrect info to be received on earth..maybe it is an object but just for living on not so much for energy collection..time will tell..maybe
Aliens would simply use fusion... duh
"So we are looking at something we can't explain, we can't get there, ever. Even if you see/find something truly weird or revealing... What does it matter?  It's like someone sitting in a skyscraper in Manhattan looking trough his telescope to other people living their lives while he/she sits there forgetting to live his own live. Maybe all those millions can be spend on our planet, Earth.... So far i know we only have 1 planet we can live on, Only 1 planet we can reach. No other planet out there is habitable for us. So tell me. What tf does it all matter? Maybe it is time to start spending money on THIS planet, on humans instead of hypothetical aliens. We live on a planet with resources that 1 day will end...Maybe we should be busy looking at resources close to us, fix problems here and now. The future is coming. We all know our future is death for all...eventually we are all going to die humans will go extinct all or reserves spend no coal, no oil, no gas, nothing......This Earth will go on without us....until after a few million years it has replenished its self and maybe life will start again....

"First off I gotta say its an very commendable feat to be ted talk presenter. Now I have to ad that its pretty arrogant to hear someone say the most mysterious star, the universe is massively vast and perhaps even infinite so to make a claim about a star in comparison to the rest of the universe wouldn't you have to have studied every star, thats never going to happen so I just think the claim is badly worded. IMHO I could be wrong and Im not an astronomer but when someone makes a claim about the entirety of nature itself I feel the urge to correct. Maybe its just semantics ........anyhow I have the respect for scientists sometimes I think they take leaps into claims and statements, kinda like where the main voices of science were saying the world is flat, the sun revolves around the earth, the earth is the center of the universe. Im just speaking my mind before you throw your calculators and protractors at me chill I love science and the art of exploring the unknown but when one woman makes a definitive absolute claim I like to retort and challenge the wording. Peace happy astronomy and science to you all. BTW my favorite heavenly bodies or creation is a quasar"
What if it's a planet like Saturn with a ring system and several moons and the rings are titled so that when it comes into view the curve looks sharper than you would expect.
"Whitehorse yukon about 1 hour out of town and about -30 to -50 celcius are you treated to an imagine exactly like this 0:45

It's like a giant screen above your head with every pixel lit up. Beautiful and I'll never forget it..strange too that phone cameras don't pick up the dim stars"
"It's probably just a big ringed planet like Saturn passing in front of the star with it's rings at different orientations, this would give different types of light reduction patterns depending on the angles of the rings."

If they're that advanced, they got energy covered.
But it could be the beginning of a Ringworld."
"6:03 - assume the data is right, and our assumptions are wrong.   Is this blocking light AT the star, or some point in between earth and the star (so, multiple objects in space, between earth and the star, maybe not even orbiting at all, but you could also have very very long orbit times, etc, of many objects and your time frame is simply not long enough)."
"Do you ever wonder why there are so many from the scientific community who talk about their take on astronomy ? None of them can be proved wrong , and neither can they be proved right ."
"It's a conclusion based on assumptions not solid physical proof and chances are that it could be wrong .

Updates anyone?
Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter? No one caught that?
Could it be several objects and not one big ?
"The idea behind Dyson Spheres is preposterous.  In our solar system the Sun makes up c. 98% of all the stuff in the Solar System (planets, asteroids etc.).  Take our Solar System as an example...most of the mass of the planets are made from gas, leaving a small remnant of physical 'stuff' to make the Dyson Sphere from.  Lets say metal for the sake of argument.  In order to produce a metal 'sphere around the sun it would have to be made as far away from the surface of the sun to stop it melting - so at best it would sit outside the orbit of Mercury to be effective.  So a sphere surrounding the Sun but of a size that would extend beyond the orbit of Mercury would require millions of times more metal than is in the Solar System....and therefore impossible to build.  If you say that they can travel to other stars to obtain the metal to build it, this would require millions of journeys and over hundreds of thousands of years (if we agree that you cannot travel faster than the speed of light).  And if they can travel to other stars, why build a Dyson Sphere anyway?"
Bla bla bla
"(03:30) That “Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter“ is misleading.

The _diameter_ of Earth is an 11th of Jupiter´s. The dip in a star´s light curve will obviously be highly correlated with the frontal area of the respective celestial bodies -- but what about the matter of the planet transiting into the _limn_ of the relevant sun?

This must have been anticipated by the scientists, but I have never heard this being explicitly addressed."

"The claim that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence is itself an extraordinary claim, and one for which there is no objective standard or evidence that it has any bearing on good science. 

What is extraordinary in the history of science? Well, just about everything we now know was extra-ordinary before it became accepted.  That status quoticians don't want to face changes to what they think they know is a poor reason to make challengers jump through additional hoops. This constant quoting of Sagan's rule is just a way to hold back scientific progress. It is not good science, it is dogma."
"Wouldn't the transition BEHIND the star increase the light a little while getting close to the passing (depending on the albedo of the planet) and then dip to normal during the passing behind, with roughly the same time the dip takes when in front of the star?"
What if the signal is from an ancient human civilization that got trapped out there long ago? And we have ever since been trying to contact Earth to get back? Maybe a past human civilization transported itself across that distance but could never figure out how to return.
"perhaps an alien society is communicating through the light signal. The surest way to contact a civilization many light years away is by shuttering a sun signal, kind of like a telegraph."
Universe  is  an illusion..
Imagine a civilization so much more advanced than ours that they just might be able to solve their energy  needs  by a means a little more practical than a colossal super megastructure  Dyson Sphere.

"Most likely a natural occurrence. I find it funny that people still think alien super structures would exist around stars. It's like asking someone in 200 AD what the year 2000 would be like. They'd have no idea. Our concept of a Dyson sphere is rooted in a very archaic understanding of technology. Just like you couldn't expect someone from a hundred years ago to understand self driving cars and predict the programing or what a computer even was that controls it. As our understanding grows it's clear the path to limitless power is in the atom and even quantum.  Even if a sufficiently advanced society needs all of a stars energy there are more subtle and cost effective ways to get it. Like opening a small singularity into the center tapping directly into the heart of that enormous fusion reactor. Dyson spheres just don't make sense. Not time, resource, or cost effective. Knowledge opens that door. And knowledge is power."

You are 100% Right
"So is the James Webb Telescope gonna have a look, at least to get a bit more information 🔭"
Your signal could be passing through plasma fields causing a light shift or possible two or three objects in space we have yet to encounter which cause similar signal distortion.   Hope to hear from you about your conclusions.

Scientists Discover SHOCKING Star That Changes Everything!!!
"Oh so you assume all that crap, what if this and what if that, which was funnier than funnier and stupid assumption and it doesn''t come to mind to assume that something maybe pass by close to Kepler and block the light."
The Dyson Sphere has always seemed far fetched and unnecessary. If you had the right technology you wouldn't need to build something so big. However to travel across the universe using exotic elements from neutron stars the aliens would bend space-time and it took tremendous amounts of power.. Quantum entanglement and exotic nuclear elements provide the basis for applying this amount of power to bend space-time and travel across the universe instantaneously. There are pyramids on Mars. They are not relics of the past but beacons to the Future.
"If an alien civilization is that advanced to harness their Sun’s energy or destroy Sun’s, they would have already made contact with humans and took our Sun?"
"The standard  inflationary theory  states that  1 llhr is 24thr is 360 sd or 24lhr is 24ld is 360 sd x 24...however  there is 10secods of light  for every space day or 10 seconds  of time for  every 1shr. Here  the microwave background radiation  calculation  is not the  concern  for the universe is very  efficient there  are no  leftovers. However  the applicable theory is the standard  deflationary theory... exists  parallel the standard inflationary theory  works/exists. Therefor  the conclusion is that there is the thing invisible, inaccessible  and immortal as Romans 12: visible comes from invisible."
"Funny, if you think your job is to dismiss a potential outcome at all cost first and foremost :D"

What an honor!  Tabby of ”tabby’s star” fame explaining her star to us herself!
those pesky little green men at it again.
I totally agree to the fact that we are not alone in the entire universe
"Yeah, aliens is always the last resort. And hope to never finds them.
I'm personally convinced on the theory of the ""Dark Forest"".
Nobody's around in the galaxy wants to be noticed by others that can easily wipe them out from existence.
So we remain hidden, we grown, we become strong and maybe then we try to find aliens.
Before? It's just a suicide."
"It's not crazy. Computers are machines made by us. And since we can fail, then also computer can fail. The product of an imperfect being can be imperfect too. It's congenit in its nature."
Boring
"Its a massive solar system, and galaxy maybe, no?
One like ours and it happens to spin on an access that matches our view. Massive planet with multiple massive moons could explain the crazy sloping light dip. Could be crazy number of planets."
Lmao why is this brilliant lady dressed as a cat lady
SETI is not the correct way to examine tabby. I believe that a civilization advanced enough to be responsible for the activity. Would have evolved a communication ability far beyond using radio waves for communication. Communicating at light speed would be useless in the distances involved with interstellar communication with radio waves
"How about a binary star pair A and B, in an orbit such that the neither star occludes the other, as viewed from the earth.  The May 2009 asymmetry could be a planet starting to transit A (which seems bigger but dimmer) and then B (brighter, bigger dip). Feb 2013 seems to involve 3 planets (1520 1540, and1570). Interestingly here each occlusion seems to fit with a 2-sun transit profile."
Intelligent alien life definitely exists.  Even if you ignore regardless of all means with contrast to religious bigots here. No one can hide the truth. We are not alone.
Yea both moon and earth collided and made perfect circle shapes🤔🤔yea ok😂😂😂😂 evolution is a joke.  To believe moon and earth made perfect circle shape means people believe they had great grandparents that were apes millions of years ago and evolved into humans 😂😂🤣😂😂. My great grandparents ALWAYS been human. I don’t have apes as ancestors 😂🤣🤣😂
"If these were indeed aliens, they would have been advanced enough to engage in solar system wars at a time when earth had its first dinosaurs. Since that light took millions of years to reach earth. Shows you how primitive man really is compared to other worlds."
Do you still consistently get that data?
Can we all just agree that until we get out there which is never going to happen that this is all pure speculation
This was my boyfriends professor last semester😭 Literally the most badass woman in existence and he didn’t even attend her office hours
"I have this theory of mine what if it's the kingdom of God where God is going to be sending us he's the ruler of us people say that might be Heaven and Earth that God is preparing for us to live in after death like God says in the Bible we won't be able to get to heaven without him so what I mean is he's the one that will be taking us to that star because it's impossible to get there we humans will take thousands and thousands and thousands of years to get to that star I just want you to think about that I think it's a really good very Theory I would love to hear what you guys have to say so, and I would like to hear you guys opinion"
"what is it with people that call themselves ""scientists"" makes them think that they are any better then what she calls ""citizen scientists"". So called scientists in the current day are more interested in proving their agenda then doing science and it's a shame because they are setting humankind back decades"
"Just a thought… What if there are binary planets orbiting each other at a location in between the Earth and KIC 8462852? Could this possibly produce the data collected? The binary planets could block a substantial percentage of the star’s light if they were much closer to us, and the light blocked could be asymmetrical as the binary planets both move in front of KIC 8462852."
Tabby star is where this simulation gets its energy to simulate the universe.
any culture able to optimize their star power would be invisible to us because of a lack of light energy?
What about an asteroid belt going around the star.
We must absorbe materials from space to increase the volume of our planet; instead of trying to inhabit other planets.
It’s a shame that she’s a boring person and has a lousy sounding voice.

"Quran   ""We will show them Our signs in the horizons and within themselves until it becomes clear to them that it is the truth. But is it not sufficient concerning your Lord that He is, over all things, a Witness?""

Quran   ""Recite in the name of your Lord who created - Created man from a clinging substance. Recite, and your Lord is the most Generous - Who taught by the pen - Taught man that which he knew not.

Quran   "" And it is He who created the heavens and the earth in six days - and His Throne had been upon water - that He might test you as to which of you is best in deed. But if you say, ""Indeed, you are resurrected after death,"" those who disbelieve will surely say, ""This is not but obvious magic.""""

And so we are at 2021 - so what happened?
The greatest empire in the Universe was responsible for the creation of large objects...
We can capture star energy with a Dyson sphere around our sun and it's simple to do just launch satellites as many as possible everyday out of Earth's orbit and as we orbit our star dropping satellite poops and in one year boom we orbit our sun and successfully build a Dyson sphere around our sun or keep sending satellite poops for decades and the Dyson sphere will just keep getting stronger and stronger as we go around the sun

"It was not mentioned if the shading pattern repeats, or was a one time observation.  If one time observation, would a shower of space debris passing between the star at a closer distance to earth provide the pattern you are seeing?"

People talk about Dyson spheres and mega structures. Let me say. We dont need to harvest 100% of a stars output to become a galactic civilization. Even up to 1% can be very very good.
Galactus comes!
"how dumb can you be, ""it's an alien"" wow"
Now we know that this wasn't a Dyson sphere but it's still so freaking cool!

The universe consists of pure - Information - is the universe. 

What is information?
One bit of information is a technology 

Two bits of information create a new independent information- a new information structure 

What are atoms or matter? 
Structures of information or better, technologies! 

One technology = one individual atom 

Two technologies make a new technology 

A - new structure made up of two inner technologies or structures. Itself is a technology. Independent

"It would seem that this dip theory would only be accurate if each proposed object blocking light were all in the exact same orbit. If I duplicate this theory into a scale model, I used an apple at a distance of 12 "" from a center point, then I took a pee and made its orbit 6"" from center,  from this theory you could only assume yes 2 planets obliqued the center light, you also might even be able to tell me the size of both the pee and the apple . But youd only be able to guess the orbit size, because you're only basing dips on the amount of light taken away. I get that its advancement.  But. With this theory you're guessing alot.."

"I’m no scientist but why would an alien civilization block out the sun for short periods?If it’s a structure that harnesses energy, you’d expect it to be relatively permanent. If it’s a Death Star or something like that, it would block the light regularly as opposed to irregularly due to its orbit. Seems to clearly be some other phenomena that were not aware of since were lacking an alien motive for the pattern shown"

The thing revolving around may not be spherical: this explains the irregular dips
I can’t believe that someone as intelligent as this would put forward ideas as implausible as these.
I suspect it is a small blackhole orbiting a much heavier star.
In between The star And Kepler  there’s a black hole

I don't agree with the idea of aliens building mega structure around the star.  don't you think to build such stupendous structures the amount of energy and meterial  they need which are already limited in their planet?

"What if multiple planets (irregular in shape) like our system are revolving around the star. When multiple planet cross the observation frame at around same time can cause depth in graph combining the surface area of all the planets in one frame. As all planets have different velocity, so each time they cross the frame of observervation, number of planets would be different causing obstruction of light in different pattern. Adding to the above suggestion, light obstruction can depend on two possible things size of the planet and distance of the planet from the star, if bigger planets are there in short distance from the star it would obstruct more light as compared to when that planet is far."

"What if a mega structure was built on the home planet to absorb/harvest their host star's energy? wouldn't that produce the A symmetrical dip on Kepler data? The dips at 5:05 look like 1/8th to 1/10th of the size of the planet - that could be the
protrusion of a (mega structure) made from say ""Silicon"" and heat retardant metals (unknown to us) but would still allow for the absorption and storage of energy (this is possible). And wouldn't time be relative to the size of a planet? how can we define time from our perspective? to us it might be a week, to them it might be 12 hours."
"Why can't these be a constellation of planetary objects consisting of various sizes orbiting that star, and which roughly align to the earth's line of sight every few years???

I would say, it could be that the different planets that are orbiting the star might have a similar orbiting time cycle, and might align every few years thus make the light of the star dip or appear like the graph that we have been presented here. 
 
Maybe, it requires extended period of observation to prove this.. But, just imagine even planets in our Solar system align every 1000 years in the same plane. 

If the star is young and the planetary system has just formed then they may be circling the star faster and hence might align more frequently.. but this is again just a theory like any other.."
So we know for sure that physics is the same throughout the universe

"I think it's reasonable to assume that there are millions upon millions of objects floating about in the vast space between us and the star in question. Can the keppler telescope tell how far away the transiting objects are from the star or is the transit itself the only thing that is observed? If you put your hand up and cover the sun so it doesn't shine into your eyes, no one would suggest that your hand is galactic in its dimensions. Its just closer to your eye. Are all the transits different or was a pattern observed over time which would suggest orbiting bodies? Without being able to identify which of the transits were caused by orbiting objects we can't say that any are. In the space between us and the star in question there are many moving objects, things that looked big might just be closer to us."

"Maybe we just aren't meant to know. I mean, human brains are TINY. We can't possibly understand the mysteries at the bottom of our ocean, and that's still on this Earth!!! Going a little off topic here- many people don't believe that the sun will eventually explode, they don't think the world can just end, but it won't. The WORLD won't end, only our world. I believe that the universe has existed forever. Suns are created, planets are created, some hold life, others don't. And after a while, every sun explodes, destroying that solar system and all the life on it. However, out of the wreckage, a new solar system is formed, with new plants and animals and maybe even something else entirely. Its quite possible that no other being has ever left their solar system, even beings much more intelligent than humans. So, when our sun explodes, I believe that humans will die, and that will be the end of the Earth. I do think that ""aliens"" exist. Is it really even possible that there are so many stars in the sky, so many planets orbiting around them, so many solar systems that we can't even see, and our Earth is the only planet in existence with life? I seriously doubt that. But why can we not be satisfied wondering? Do we really NEED to know? Why not just accept that we will never find out? Maybe in death we will finally understand all the wonders of the universe, or, better yet, be reborn somewhere else, with no knowledge of our past life, and get to wonder all over again from some far away solar system. Again, this is all my opinion, the perspective of a twelve-year-old girl, who can't help but question everything."

"It’s very possibly foreground space crap, in motion and lined up to obscure our view of the star. Rather like an eclipse."

It was just Goku using a spirit bomb again.
"Why do we see stars !? A star is an omnidirectional emitter of coherent electromagnetic waves! In essence, we see a pillar of a ray of light! Everything is very simple! We see stars only because our Sun in our galaxy flies in sync with the rest of the stars! The distance between the stars is increasing, but it is so very - a slow process that lasts for millions of years. That is, an astronomer cannot observe the change in such long processes, since Earth time flies by with lightning speed! And so, now we know that distant stars are statically attached to one coordinate point in the sky, but why does the light of the stars travels so long distances, reaching our optic nerve? 1010
It's all about COHERENCE! The emitted light of the stars forms a kind of laser beam of light, in one of the radiation spectra such as X-rays this radiation is most effective. The rotation of the stars around their axis further enhances the coherence by pumping the beam. In fact, we see a column of a ray of light, but we see only that beam-column that flies in our direction, forming a peak - an energy point. In neighboring solar systems, people observe the phase radiation of the beam but several degrees to the side. The formed point in the sky confirms that the star is exactly in the place of its coordinates! if the Star could move relative to our Sun, then no coherent ray would be able to form.

"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.""

Ten minutes into the talk.
""Hey guys! ALIENS!"""
"I feel like the jump between explaining what it could be, into aliens and Dyson sphere was too quick. That part of the talk needed a quick bridge like “well, what if an object that’s not natural has appeared around this star? What if something’s being built?” Enter, aliens,"
Dyson sphere is extraordinary bullshit.
"Here we are some 4 years later, and I'm praying a giant asteroid will strike Earth and end all life. Humanity has failed."
Bob Lazar explains that the alien craft he worked on didn't give off any heat either
"And she is too humble to mention that this star is named after her: Tabby's star. There are not many stars named after people, maybe a hundred in total (and I'm not one of them 😁)"

Can't it just be a planet or planets going across the star?
The dips in the light were from a Flying Spaghetti Monster.

Probably noble gases and dust compounds orbiting the star at such a distance as to mimic an unusual phenomenon.
they said its a some dust. strange dusts.
This sound hella dumb but it’s possible that intelligent life out there could look similar to what movies/shows show them to look like.  Think about it there is some weird looking animals out there like there is a vampire bat that drinks blood. There is a fish that literally has a bright light coming out of its head that it can turn on/of

"I am shocked that even you! have no clue as to what is causing the data dips ( blocking the light coming from a distant star known as KIC 8462852) It's been about 4 1/2 years since you shared this Phenomenon, and we now understand what has resulted in this data mystery! Boyajian's Star is approximately 1,470 light-years (450 pc) from Earth, Not really that far of a distance! Years ago (Stay with me here) Years ago, Tin Foil was used for cooking, wrapping leftovers and shielding for early aircraft wiring harnesses. This Tin use at times resulted in heavy waste/doneage. Production of aluminum foil in the United States started in 1913. The first commercial use: packaging Life Savers into their now world-famous shiny metal tube quickly ended the use of Tin Foil. Aluminum is the most common metal found within the earth's crust (8 percent) but does not occur as a metal in its natural state, However; since 2017 (Year this video was released) Extremely Large (Humongous!) Planets have been discovered and some very close to  KIC 8462852! as a matter of fact we now think These Huge Planets will soon be harvested for their abundance of a certain raw material ""Munimula"" Yes From Planets called ""Munimula""  YES! were robots are called the Munimula men, and they came from a metal planet called, yep, Munimula. These Planets are abundant in Aluminum or should I say ""Munimula""! So now you know the rest of the story!"

"But if they say that it is Dyson's sphere then the star light would have been blocked completely by the structure but that was not the case.
It maybe that it might be a planet just bigger than the size of our Jupiter being crushed by the gravity of the star and convert it into particles which leads to block the star light completely with some comets and asteroids"
It's Starships recharging their solar batteries ?
It's real real amazing
"I came here looking for an answer and not only I don't get it, but I now have more doubts !!!"
"Unless admission of being descendants of a race or altered by an externally evolved advanced race, the level of arrogance displayed is staggering. There is, without too much explanation or logical argument, a vast dichotomy between HUE-men and a Kind of Man.  I am not saying or asserting that one is better than the other I am merely suggesting the explanation that is not so seriously dismissed or contrived. A Kind of Man existed separate from the natural order of this planet and those of Hue-Men are obviously ""attached"" to the natural paradigm of this planet and the often awkward association between each. The observed consistent culture of A Kind of Man is to colonize their environment to operate in an altered state than what was found to the same that Mankind is more familiar with. Hue-men are beings that are mega supportive to the adoption of the environment they find themselves in. Add to this, the accounts reported of ""Alien"" abductions are mostly linked to A Kind of Man and rarely involve Hue-men. While some may say I am mental for what I have proposed, I leave you all with the rule of the simpler more likely to be correct, truth."
Team of scientists have a discussion why I am here !
"If they exhausted the energy of their home planet, how do they build the megastructures?"
"After watching this, I feel like earth might be the group project of alien students somewhere up there"
"If thei energy was depleted, where did they get the energy to produce these structures?"
I have gone throughout India no water and just evaporation. Dirty water. Nobody can understand.
"In what way this theories are helping the man kind, let the aliens to live, let humans to live, instead of levering the scientific world levitate the human, first learn to know the man kind ,then you can go the unwanted deep space where time runs way beyond human life span. develop a society to save the one and one planet among trillions, since one does the matter"
"Thanks Summer, Rick is proud"
"Aliens???
In my opinion there are hundreds of planet orbiting that star, that's it .
And according to their positions you are getting that dips."
So megastructures like in Avengers Infinity War the place called Nidavellir

"I am excited to see what we find after we launch the James Webb Space Telescope. The thing is much more massive than Hubble and will discover so many new things in our universe. The only thing that makes me nervous is 1. The launch could fail, losing billions of dollars and will take forever to restart and 2. it will be launched much farther out than Hubble was, making repairs if something goes wrong impossible."

Asteroids.....or an alien superstructure that outputs it’s heat into an alternate dimension.....hmmmm
"Chill out earthlings, we don´t exist. ops.."
As of Dec 2019 we understand that this is not a Dyson Sphere. The most plausible explanation is the star stole a moon from a long gone planet in its system. Now that the Star being swirled with the debris for the this moon which is being ripped a part.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l7ZRZWhJqDY
"Perspective is wrong. It isn't a planet orbiting a star, it's a star orbiting a black hole. You're seeing the star dip behind the black hole and the erratic light patterns are lensing."
My guess would be a comet or an astroid that is coming from begin Kepler and passes by Kepler relatively close. That would make Kepler see a huge structure/astroid making the light drop for Kepler of more than 20%. And it could stay inside the view of Kepler for a while before showing that star again.... But Kepler-data must be able to rule this out..?
Eve online project discovery anyone?
Map please correct yourself we have not discovered the whole universe
"When I see the Batman signal transiting the star, I'll begin to worry."
"One of the facts I find most interesting is often not spoken of. Many scientists use this data in real time as if these stars were down the street when in reality these stars are thousands and often millions of light years away. So, in a sense, they are looking at data that is extremely old. The truth is, there's no way to know what is out there now, it could be completely empty and all we are seeing is the remnants of a once full galaxy."
"So it’s either 1,we don’t know ! Or 2 we don’t know! Lol! I still likes listening"
We are not alone in this universes . if we think we are alone in this universes that is selfish thought .
"this found just not tell anything.. it sounds interesting but it is not, more likely this found released to wrap peoples interest into. Obviously there whole space is book to read, scientists made big job to hide space from peoples view. And continue doing it everyday.. those black holes so boring.. but they insist in those."
Scientist always want to take the easy way out and go with the natural explanation Even if the alien one is more compelling
Why not a travelling blackhole??
What a collosal waste of resources
"Evidence is evidence.  It may be boring or fascinating but at the end of the day, it’s still evidence."

"Now I'm not a scientist BUT, i do have a logically driven brain.  It occurs to me that, in common with many scientific 'findings' and consequent conclusions that there could be more rational explanations for the so-called anomalies found in the data.  Taking this lady's first point in particular - what if two or more bodies were orbiting the star at roughly the same time?  That could account for the oddly shaped light dip. Additionally,  the magnitude of any light dip is also dependent on the distance of the orbiting body/s from the star and not a direct indication of their size?  Or did I miss something crucial here?"
Just a spider on the lens of the telescope.......or ...... maybee Mars kanali inside the human brain.....

Maybe it’s alien morse code dot dot dash  .

There are more than one planet moving around the sun on different orbits. Sunlight was shredded when all those planets passing through the same point as we've seen from earth.
how do you discern if its an asteroid or comet that's passing by the star but at a distance much closer to us?  Is it because the object is supposedly passing by the star on its supposed yearly orbit?
am gonna call my alien friend ! am gonna help to hide them ! 😴😴😴
"there is no real proof, this is old news, transits of planets across stars light curves prove nothing, only when you can see it pysciclly, she mentioned earth mars collisions really? don't stars obit each other, and aliens, alien structures, what planet is she on?"
That was Thor at Nidavellier 😂
Time Dilation???
what she actually saw was a fire fly in her window .
Outstanding presentation!!!! I would love to see the new data.
From 2:45
"One possibility mentioned was multiple comets, another was a planetary collision.    What I didn't hear was the though I have, and that would be a post planetary collision, looking through the debris left from a planetary scale collision.  It would be more likely that aliens building a planetary size object in space."
"stars can wink out, you know"
how about a sunspot [or starspot]
So Whats the status now in 2020?
"I think it’s the result of a stray solar system merging with this star’s system and causing multiple alignments from our perspective. With the second star appearing from behind KIC and the stray planets merging orbits in some binary system sort of way. Some planets collide with others, create debris, etc."
"Did she say Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter? Thats partially incorrect information, Yes, the diameter of Jupiter is 11 times more than Earth but the Earth is 1500 times smaller than Jupiter in volume which means Jupiter can engulf 15 Earth size planets .
If you even combine the remaining 7 planets , Jupiter can still larger than all of them."
May be a huge ring planet is passing by and that is causing fluctuations in light
No one is more evoluate than me and dysons sphere are stupide .....

I have good memories on altair .....
"Perhaps I'm barking up the wrong tree here but if someone were to look at our Sun from far away they would record the transits of all planets because they are in the same ecliptic, which I guess is true of most planetary systems. So if they happened to record planetary conjunctions, wouldn't that produce the effects described in the video?"
Tabitha is the best talker and teacher..
aliens talking about other aliens.
u talking crazy though
One of my top wishes is... that the Stars were as bright as they were in the 60s and early 70s... light pollution has hidden 98% of them... I remember seeing the distinct arms and clouds of our Galaxy...
Since we are all throwing theories what if what they saw was the creation of our solar system 🤯
"'Even alien mega-structures cannot defy the laws of physics.' Where do the 'laws of physics' then come from? Let us first define 'law'. A law is something which is unchangeable and predictable or reliable. We know God as Creator. But we should also know Him as Law-giver.  He is above the laws He gave. And his creation is subject to his laws. 
Now we are standing at the very cradle or fount of Christian science (I am not talking about the religion with the same name). Suddenly, everything in creation fits into our reality view (also known as life and world view). Suddenly, everything makes sense, however vague this sense may yet be! Suddenly, we have our place in God's creation, knowing God's law of love, and answering to it with our own love! God is the great Law-Giver. And the basic law which He gave to govern his creation is his law of love. Even what we are perceiving about Tabetha's mysterious star cannot be divorced from God's love! neelsmalan@gmail.com"
Such a medieval analysis
How far is that star?
"The conclusion...is it the only unique one or many others like that?  People are generally bored of gazing at stars.. they rarely do that... This may change their perceptions from this time on.. For myself,  I would gladly to have 500mm binoculars perched over me lying in my sleeping bag on a humble cot all night over and over again... I can  catch cat naps and continue on gazing at the same boring stars all my life!   this is my job description.. will work for peanuts.. Rations of pot will be appreciated as well.."
Could it just be multiple sized planets orbiting the star?
Methuselah? Also what does she mean by earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter? Is she talking about flat surface area like if they were both coins. You could supposedly fit 1000 earths into to Jupiter. 3 alone in the eye of that storm. Wtf
"Thing about science is the more you know, the more you are fucked up. Idk but why we are looking for aliens? Everything is light years away and here we are can't even make a machine who's top speed can be matched with light. Just watch star wars and star trek and be happy. No need to wonder too much. We are going to die anyway"

There are no aliens.  They don’t exist.  Fun thing to ponder.  What would it mean if this were proved to be true?  That we are the only higher life form in existence anywhere.   What premises or paradigms would we have to re-think? Could we move away from the slavish devotion to science.? What else?
All the TED speakers are female
"ordinary people
extraordinary stars

this words coming from the mouth of an astronomer woman who knows that the universe is endless and there are a countless number of stars"
that would be me
"A planet that is not spheric with a surface of ice reflecting the light, and spinning fast changing even the axis?"
its a binary star...its not a planet but a white dwarf that it is in a tight orbit with
"This woman is my astronomy professor, and she curves an A- to 72. Geaux Tabetha!"
Let's pretend there are aliens and imagine what if..............??? 😂😂😂
What about a giant ring system planet like Saturn passing in front os the star light???
"As soon as she mentioned  "" nasa "" I knew she was gonna start  lying."
"This is a gas cloud, too which is being reshape, from time to time by the sun ."
Top fact... If they ever find another life form out there.... We will be the last to know.... Until its too late
What if the star isn’t dimming because something is passing in front of it but because something is using the star for fuel
"weird to think that a minor proportion of stars seen nightly, may no longer actually be in existence, or could be a nebula where it exists, so very far away. hey: a binary star system where one of the two is an extra large brown dwarf."
The Death Star destroys another planet!
"Why is it assumed that an advanced alien race would need to build a ""Dyson sphere"" in order to utilize star energy.  Maybe we should be using evidence and facts to explore the light transmission problem from KIC 8462852."
what if a bunch of planets where aligned with each other given the impression that you have one only giant planet?
One of the most boring TED talks
I would explain this like this: somebody forgot to dust the lenses on kepler
My grandfather own that star. Please dont disturb it
I think she's going to have to feed that technical hay to some other horse.
hello all the queen her was is right and the truth 2020.com
Maybe asteroids of different sizes were passing in front of it.
"Stop using the phrase “Extraordinary claims, require extraordinary evidence. It is not a true statement."
Have you tried zooming in?
Aliens are out thair
"Not a research scientist, interesting enough, have no problem in understanding the concept of measuring the light intensity. The rest is just jibberish and due to the lack of time travel, we will never know the answers. Speed of light travel is also pointless due to the distances involved."
"Another possibility - we are seeing something much smaller but way closer, e.g. Kuiper Belt or Oort cloud objects within our own solar system along the same plane as the line of sight between us and KIC 8462852. It could be a bit  like getting a fruit fly on your camera lens and thinking there is some huge object at a distance blotting out the light - remember these aren't focused images, just light intensity data. Nah, an alien civilization is a much cooler explanation."
Wow 2020
I have a theory... Something paranormal I can prove
Everyone is a comedian.
"That's a lot of money out the door, just to study the universe."
Who pays for all of this stuff??
Interesting talk. Very smart speaker!
Maybe it’s huge planet with huge belt. Improving instruments is the key
"idiopathic change could be in our ort cloud, foreshortening accounts for large and long changes"
Sounds like super volcanic activity to me . Super bursts
This is really scary! They still don't know what this is?
"Such hyperbole. Any of these people ever heard of the Ort Cloud,, Kuiper belt or asteroid belt? This is something similar, NOT alien megastructures."
"I look at tiny flickering lights in the sky. Pay me. Oh, and it ""could"" be aliens! You know, like in the movies. All i need is a few measly billions of dollars so i can continue to study it for the benefit of all mankind. Any single person who questions my logic will be deemed a religious flat earther and blocked."
Why don't we hear any update on these discoveries?
What a fabulous lady. Really interesting!
"""Could it be an alien-built megastructure?"" 

Of course it could, based on a flat planet. That would recquire much less mass to obscure the light, when we watch it from the side. Or perhaps the obscuring whatever are a colony of angels ... or big green men ... or ... 

The video is only almost four years old.

Pleeeeeaze"
"Well, there's always a simple explanation. The simplest is the hardest because its right in the front of you and it's probably why Kepler is on another mission because a further explanation is not needed. Kepler had by than pointed its search forwards this real big star. But while it observes and is moving - an astroid a big asteroid travels in between Kepler and the big star. The asteroid doesn't have to be that big if it is close to Kepler because the size of Kepler is small enough that a moving asteroid or big comet having a circular orbit as Kepler continues to its next mission moves further away from direct sight. A rigid comet or asteroid with rigidness enough to cause dips as it shows on your light detector shows its rigidness even more if the comet asteroid rotates as it moves it changes the direct sight of its movements (4 years optical radius) Finally as Kepler vanishes out of its sight - a mystery is initialized. Optical apparatuses are natural in space. Alien's not so optical."
earth... flat
Enough with the Alien hypothesis
made by aliens that have been going to university and college 10.000  years 500 generations.
I think thor was making stormbreaker
What’s if it’s just a rogue black hole sucking the light?
"The multiple comet hypothesis was stated as the most reasonable, but rather than comets how about the solar systems own Kuiper Belt or Oort cloud being so distant from the sun that the heat signature is undetectable with our current technology. Looking at images of our own kuiper belt there are massive gaps and alternate density's of material. Is there a formula for determining a sphere of gravitational influence that would determine the possible distance of a kuiper belt based on density and mass of the sun that can add this hypothesis to the list of probabilities?"
"when you look at something far away with a binocular and a closer object is trespassing your sight  very close to your binocular ,  you will see that the  object or person is blocking a lot from your view sight making it to look huge and endless. What if  these blocking sunlight cuts off are caused by some random (closer to us) huge asteroids tresspassing the sight of the telescope sensor ? Is it possible  ?"
i keep looking up.
The planet's orbit is probably elongated. In this case we could observe the eclipse at an angle that allowed it to shadow the star slowly from the left and disappear much quicker to the right from the field of view while still moving towards us. Simple as that.
So whats the latest?
"... the simplest rationale is two planets 1) a massive planet with a slow orbit with its moons causing the multiple light blockage then 2) a second planet passing the host star within the same time frame. 
... the whole alien idea is a far stretch. Can you get a strong enough telescope to LOOK at it? (Or maybe they did and the findings are kept secret 🤭🤔)"
"This is how you justify $$$ of non productive money,and never let a scientist make a preesention or tell a joke."
Human can recognize pattern better than computer?  That’s a false statement.

"People who discount intelligent life in the Universe are degenerate bacteria, rather they are viruses that feed on humans and invoke fear in humanity so that people will give them money. Money that comes from trees, trees that give us life.

Those who are against space colonization and there being intelligent life in the Universe are demons. They want us to consume all of the trees on Earth through the persecution factor so that we will have less and less oxygen. The more religion persecutes people for their sins more money is needed to satisfy the consumption, meaning more trees are cut down.

Less oxygen means humans and life on Earth dies. When humans die the sentient ability to travel into space and conquer planets is a less of a threat or no threat at all to the demons of space.
In religious terms, this is the fight against the Anti-Christ, the Demons, Those From Beyond the Void. All of whom value nothing more than consuming all life on planet until the planet becomes desolate like Mars is.

Its not God's retribution, God does not rebuke Creation, its against the laws of the foundation of Creation to do so. It is an alien aspect of keeping humans on the Earth until we kill ourselves off completely to keep humanity from entering space to colonize it.....we are coming however, and this time....there won't be a Mars scenario to finalize the situation.

Don't believe me? GFYS as well.

I went back through the artifacts that I found in the images I took of Vega in the Lyra constellation. Most appear to be bacteria of some sort. I even found staph in one panel.
staph bacteria

https://i.imgur.com/tzsMCAF.jpg

But...finding bacteria in photo is one thing,but when you find bacteria that is close to the same shape of the constellation next to Vega, you have to wonder. Is there life in the constellation to the left of Vega that is already here on Earth?

Now why would bacteria seen in the four roundels take on the appearance of the constellations to the left of Vega. These bacteria are most likely on the surface of the glass of the telescope, yet Vega is nearly 25 light years away.

This isn't Pareidolia either. Its not seeing insects in a rock.

"What if the information given by the computers are telling us that this star is about to go supernova. I have researched a little about how stars show the first signs of going supernova. The core could be collapsing and the star could be producing pressure every so often which would cause the star to go super giant for a little bit of time and then go back to its regular state. This could happen over and over again to a star that is about to go supernova. When the star explodes into a red giant wouldn't it cause a dip like this in light. I don't think we have actually witnessed aliens yet. I believe this is a phenomena. If the star shows that it is definitely not young, it could be reaching its end and the star could go supernova. There are a few other stars in space that are burning up there hydrogen. The star will turn into a red giant and then go back to normal over and over again before the end of its cycle which would eventually lead to a supernova. If this star is extremely far away, it probably would appear that the star is going very dim drastically and then back to normal. The dimness would last a short period of time. This is like the phenomena of the star betelgeuse. I know in this case the computer that analyzed the data is looking for planets that would cause a dip in light around there host star, but this is just an idea of what could be causing this star to have it's very odd behavior. I think this is worth looking into if not already ruled out."
"Always worth the aliens are more intelligent than humans bit, oh and they are short, 2 arms, 2 legs like humans also right. New ideas needed. Great talk though."
I wounder if they have trafic signs on Dysonsperes the size of jupiter.

So I'm guessing their equivalent to OPEC all got brutally murdered or died by accident in a burning windmill
I bet near Kepler is the planet music competition...and this giant head bloking the light
That's if these objects are the same distance from their star as earth. Could they not be nearer to us and like asymmetric rogue asteroids?
"Could it be due to some extremely large dark spots. Just a guess.

I think I also know why it's called 'Tabby star' now."
"Stupid waste of time. If your going to keep studying it, get someone with a bigger brain than you. This is nothing more than a fundraiser. Goodnight."
I believe we will find out this is just another natural phenomenon. We don't understand it yet.
I call bullshit you. We don't know what it is but aliens...
District 9 IRL soon?
Where the new data on this one
Blaming it on aliens IS a natural explanation. Unnatural would be blaming it on something paranormal like gods or ghosts or some other woowoo.
"update 2020: (even though the updated paper was published in 2018.) this whole thing isnt alien megastructures (obviously) turns out it was dust all along 🤷🏻‍♂️

if u want to read the article/paper just look up the star"
Hmm........     .....would.
Lol 😂 hahahaha
"It seems to me that two gas giants orbiting each other could cause the results they witnessed, especially if these gas giants have a lot of moons.  Each time they block the star's light, they are not in sync in their orbit of each other thus blocking different amounts of light each  year (their year) and blocking more or less light as they approach because at one part they both block light and at other parts only one or one and part of a second blocks the light."
"How do they ,now that the planet blocking the light isn't orbiting a closer star?"
"It's just two gas giants orbiting one another, their shared center of gravity orbiting the star. That would completely explain all the data."
So a comet storm/ asteroid thing is too speculative BUT Alien megastructures fighting an interplanetary war ...yeah ..
The star is only 1400 light-years away. if they're advanced and had access to space travel they might have visited us in the past. Either before Humans or in the dinosaur age.
326434863456519566445305376576460563
Spoiler: we don't know anything.
say 22 objects in different orbits all at least Jupiter size.
i think the evidence implies multiple objects.
There were multiple structures passing in front of the star that moved from sync to un-sync to sync

Photos and films have been tested by renowned technicians and scientists from their field and concluded to be definitely true.

 METAL SAMPLES==>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZmBW69OO1I
Metal samples were presented to renowned scientist in the field and subjected to various metallurgical tests which concluded that it is an alloy that cannot originate on our planet.
In astrophysics, health, medicine, and other fields of study, many scientists have used and continue to use information previously published by Billy Meier to advance knowledge, obviously without citing the source from which their research originated. We admire the true scientists who are very successful but are still in the early stage because they do not consider the spiritual part that everything and also the matter has, this is because they have not yet found their spiritual part individually and until they find it will remain limited in knowledge, development, and research. Some scientists are beginning to realize this and the process has already begun and no government or religion can stop it, as it is naturally unstoppable, like an avalanche of snow that has already begun.
Why does Billy Meier only appear in low-level media as a fraudster, hoax, etc. and does not appear in the more reputable media nor is his name mentioned? Governments, religions, and people of power will lose their influence, in other words, they will be destroyed, there will be a rearrangement in society and the TRUE FREEDOM will emerge  TRUE FREEDOM that has been misunderstood through books and misconceptions and consequently misinterpreted by us because it simply never we tried it earlier. The book TALMUD JMMANUEL individually will be able to do this historical feat, but there are more than 40 books written in German originally in all areas of human knowledge that are gradually being translated into other languages.

Maybe we humans as a civilization actually are at present in the, or very near to the, nadir of our potential? Of course we travel faster and farther; talk more, and all over places and spaces, louder, and to those who want to and do not want to listen; and of course eat more and drink more and are fatter! So what? We are trashing around, and thrashing around to escape from the trash we are wallowing in. Material, Physical, Psychological, Intellectual, Metaphysical.

"*1Co.2:* 6We do, however, speak a message of wisdom among the mature, but not the wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are coming to nothing.7No, we declare God’s wisdom, a mystery that has been hidden and that God destined for our glory before time began. 8None of the rulers of this age understood it, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.9However, as it is written:

“What no eye has seen,
what no ear has heard,
and what no human mind has conceived” —
the things God has prepared for those who love him—

10these are the things God has revealed to us by his Spirit.
The Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God. 11For who knows a person’s thoughts except their own spirit within them? In the same way no one knows the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God. 12What we have received is not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may understand what God has freely given us. 13This is what we speak, not in words taught us by human wisdom but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual realities with Spirit-taught words. 14The person without the Spirit does not accept the things that come from the Spirit of God but considers them foolishness, and cannot understand them because they are discerned only through the Spirit. 15The person with the Spirit makes judgments about all things, but such a person is not subject to merely human judgments,16for,

"surely if the graph repeats in a cyclical fashion you could separate what is orbiting the star and what is traveling obliquely, i.e. interstellar matter traveling toward us. The rotational periods are not mentioned, so assuming there is no rsimilar data in Kepler's 4-year scan, on this or any other star in the scan region, you would have to assume a massive, irregular body in orbit (yielding a pronounced star wobble) or an interstellar body on a different trajectory."
No... The most mysterious star OBSERVED.

"A dark star, a brown dwarf could effect this light with it's own large planets orbiting  it at short distances.  These could be gas giants and offer  irregular blockage and color effects.  Don't give me crap that they know how old  a star is due to it's color or intensity.   A dyson sphere cannot be built around a star.  All the material in the solar system could  build more than a thin ring around a star.  The idea is ridiculous that they could just come up with enough concrete and steel to cover an entire star.  Thousands of large planets would be needed and where are they going to get the energy to process planet sized stockpiles of raw materials?  They clearly don't have a need for MORE energy."
"Did anybody observe that  most of the time there is PIN-DROP silence in the hall, unlike in some other talks. 

The audience is so amazed at hearing about the stars and galaxies.

Imagine how it will be, when we are with God and things will NOT just be explained to us by God. But God will CREATE new stars and galaxies before our eyes to see. How awe-struck we will be.

May be WE will be made by God as IN-CHARGE (like angels), of a whole planet or a star or group of stars or even a Galaxy or Galaxies.

"How can she assume the size of a planet passing it's star when she doesn't know how far that planet is from the star it's orbiting? EXAMPLE: If the planet was orbiting extremely close to the star, it would appear smaller to us than if it was further. Are stars just so far from us that this doesn't make a difference from our perspective?"
Thanks TED
"How do we know other solar system planets circulate
in the same plane that we are observing from? 
Are we assuming all solar systems rotate in the same plane  we are in? 
Lets just say this star rotates in the same plane of sight, there could
be much debris (not in planetary form rotating in an elliptical pattern,
sometimes crossing in our line of sight and then moving out.  Or mutable planets crossing our path near the same time dropping the density."

"All the theories seemed to be tied to masses associated with the gravitational influence of the star.  Perhaps the light is being blocked by gas or dust clouds that are passing slowly between us and the star.  They would probably be closer to the star than to us, but still not under the influence of the star's gravity.  Their shape and density could be variable enough to explain the asymmetric effect on the star's light intensity."
Why cant it be stuff going in front of the telescope - near the telescope - not near the star? Looks to me more like cloaked space ships investigating our telescope...
"WHAT IF : due to the harm industries and nuclear power plants etc did to us, to earth in some few centuries, it affected our body and minds which made us look alien-like. now, till that time, in those 400-600 years, (this is how much time it will take all that to happen) so we would have developed all the kinds of devices and machines of which we always dreamt of, they now existed in future. now these alien-like creatures, who our generations turned into, they now time traveled in our time to tell us, to stop all the wrong steps which made our next generation look like aliens. so now these were the aliens who we always wanted to discover, they're the one who always kept on sending signals and to connect with us to tell us stop all that we're doing due to which they became THE ALIENS and they're our future generation itself! just their body and minds affected by the radiations, development and effects of industrial and nuclear and all. thoughts?"

"Consumption of a planet :WIKI:
In December 2016, a team of researchers proposed that Tabby's Star swallowed a planet, causing a temporary and unobserved increase in brightness due to the release of gravitational energy. As the planet fell into its star, it could have been ripped apart or had its moons stripped away, leaving clouds of debris orbiting the star in eccentric orbits. Planetary debris still in orbit around the star would then explain its observed drops in intensity.[74] Additionally, the researchers suggest that the consumed planet could have caused the star to increase in brightness up to 10,000 years ago, and its stellar W.T.Flux is now returning to the normal state. :PM:As the Low mass star began is consumption of the metallic core, the increase of light permeated the sky in a fragmented but brief process.
:PM:You have to remember The universe only takes what it needs. It was probably just hungry at the time and went night night.

"i have commented before on this video but have decided to add a little more.


the building blocks of life as we know it are abundant in the universe,  we exist as proof that life can just spring up out of those elements if the conditions are right, it is only scientists and the religious who continue to perpetuate the myth that we are special and that the chances for life on other planets are slim to none, this is a stupid stance to take and any scientist who would rather use a bad explination than just admit that alien life was a possibility should not call themselves a scientist, as a scientist it is their job to have an open mind and follow the evidence where ever it may lead and to accept a theory as possible until further evidence can discount or prove otherwise, to out of hand dismiss any possibility that can have just as much weight as another simply because it goes against the narrative that scientist have on alien life is a disgrace.


i do not know if aliens exist or not, i do not discount the possibility simply because we have yet to find any, it is of course possible that we will not find the kinds of signals we are looking for, because those signals have already past us by while we were not looking, it is just as possible that we may not see such signals for another thousand years, it is also possible that we will never see another civilisation like ours because their technological evolution went a different way, how different would our technology be today if tesla had won out over eddison, just how different would our signals into space look from what they are now? aliens might not use destructive or explosive energy like we do, they might have already discovered 0 point energy a million years ago, all these things are possible and should never be discounted out of hand and scorned at just because the word aliens is involved."

"What if the star is orbiting a black hole, BUT the black hole is MUCH large than the star, so when the star orbits in front of it, causes a dip in light, but when it is behind it, the light returns to ""normal""? Considering how black holes bend light behind them so they appear brighter, this could happen, right?"

"There are 1500 light years between us and this star, and no one thought to consider that the object passing between us and it could have been something closer to us and not merely orbiting this star, an asteroid belt or anything else?

So a ring system? Doesn't sound unlikely to me"
"I want to be a scientist, I have some crazy ideas"
HOPE....the deadliest feeling
"when they say ""planet"" it means what? to begin with......whos to say its a fiery place with NOTHING but gases and rocks and crap.......NO LIFE!!!!!! where does the notion come from???? guessing??? fantasizing???"
time and space difference
"I'm calling it... but it's just MHO... we're viewing a twice-Jupiter-or-larger planet at 18 to 24 degrees off center at aphelion of an elliptical orbit.  

This unique, and possibly never-seen-before combination would produce something very similar, which may explain the slopes we see."
"Im on board for the possibility that alien life is out there. In fact, I consider it a mathematical impossibility for their not to be. But I think any one who believes a Dyson Sphere to be a possibility  should instantly looses any kinda credibility that they had in the field, not to mention self respect."
"Again, turns out it was another moth. Just a moth."
What about the possibility of colliding planets as they rotate and become one plant?
What if it's a mira star
Dyson sphere is impossible and not practical. The amount of matter it would take to build it would exceed the matter of a planet itself. Ridiculous.
"I don't get why we always assume that aliens are more intelligent than us, they could be dumber"
"Earth is hundreds of times smaller than Jupiter not eleven times !!! WTF ?! Probably just a binary or tertiary system with a brown dwarf or two. Does this woman have a degree, how can she say Earth is only eleven times smaller than Jupiter, OMG it is hundreds of times smaller not eleven !"
"13 billion years but only writing from 7,000 years ago? 😂"
"All those who say, your looking thousands of years in the past, is that because you read a book or a broke teacher that says, only when light reaches your eye you see. Lol"
Most likely the object is just a burned out white dwarf of a former large star in a binary star system.
"Aliens dont exist.
Read your Bible."
Obviously a new death star weapon being developed by the empire.
Awesome Presentation.
what a lot of silly nonsense
This is cringe material.
Astroliger ? You mean witch
what if 100s of star's planets(different size) cross at the same time? they block the light irregularly. so the irregular graph is.
at 10;15ish we make a hard turn into alien mega structures theory.  we also move into interplanetary battles. still its fun stuff and interesting the questions we come up with AND the explanations we come up with. grateful for the 50 pound heads involved and hopeful for their passionate hearts
It's the minecraft world loading chunks🤣
Is this star also known as 'Mira'?
Is GOD or ALLAH  an ALIEN????
Sick woman
But I dont think it would be so awesome if they find us.
There is another star recently discovered that is even stranger than this one! I heard Tabetha Boyajian is going to speak in front of people about it then suggest we call it Tabby's Star 2! Won't that be cute?
"poor humans , they keep searching outside the planet looking for answers and salvation but trust me all you will find out there is fallen angels cast down from the heavens and wondering around the universe looking for someone to devour, why do search the bible and find the Lord Jesus Christ our only one salvation."
"Could it just be a couple of planets (different sizes) with a similar orbit, simultaneously blocking the starlight?"
"This is the inbound planetary system that the Govt has been hiding with the sun simulator. Watch "" Universal news media"" and you will see what is in our skies and that they are trying to hide with technology. There are no aliens. They are just fallen angels and demons that started here and then left here for other worlds with their forbidden technology. Now CERN IS GOING TO BE BRINGING THEM BACK by tearing the veil into another dimension. They are even in communication with the other side already. They have sent instructions through the veil on a new computer that will be used to maintain the portal when they finally year it open. They have hidden this agenda in the past but are now saying it out in the open. They publish their data! Watch Anthony Patch and you will learn.
The time is very short. Get right with God. May the Almighty Father have mercy on us all. In Jesus name I pray. Amen. Peace out"
Pretty weak to assume that all variations in stars brightness is because there is a planet orbiting around it. Just think out from the box and you find other rational explanations.
"there is no defination of aliens, except for the jinns.."
she is looking at Jinss
"no significant proof of an, aliens, all more into fiction prone ideas all around"
and there is no what if
"human has limits, so as she, e speaker herself."
there is no such things as aliens  even with all the prooff
what she know is aliens  but in fact it is all jinns
Using some of what I discovered and told other's like two or three YOU know who you ARE with my Discovery of my 4 billion+ years old  Serpentine rock'$ in my hometown.
FYI earth moon did not collide and form two separate orbs.
more nasa BS
Season 2 in NASA : will they able to find there imagination or they going to see a big middle finger from the space.
"Do the aliens have opposable thumb's, are they DNA based, did have a Saturn v 5 type rocket and did they develop that from a second world war?"
Any updates on this? I have waited almost 3 years...
Alines with such a capabilities would find us first........and game would be over for us  1500 years back.
It's turtles.
I think KIC 8462852 needs a catchier name
planets in line between kepler and  the star can aLso produce non symmitrical  shadow
Nasa are just photographers with big lenses and big computers. Commitment tho. Big up.....
Is it possible 2 solar systems over lap as they orbit a larger mass independently?? If one is closer to earth than the other it would appear much larger and maybe have an abnormal stroke .....
"you're assuming that all things exist within laws of physics, my CREATOR, my GOD, knows countless things that don't need physics...like Love..."
"what I know for sure is that it won't be long before men destroys himself since they can't stop making bigger bombs, weapons to kill each other with. The world will exist for 6,000 years in ""GOD"" time clock. The universe is infinite, men does not time to make any instrument, device, scope, mega-computer that would even approach a quadrillion light years raised to a quintillion exponent, now I'm talking universe dimensions,.. you would do better to pray  then seek things in our infinite universe."
We live on a flat stationary plane with a firmament above
The Dyson sphere is probably complete around that star by now. We won’t know for 1480 years when we can finally observe what was going on back now.

"Yo momma's so fat, she the reason we won't find another star."
"If this phenomena is created by ET's, then it's probably long gone. Such an advanced civilization craving these need for energy has probably moved on to other technologies, moved altogether or just simply burned out. That it would stay the same today as it did a thousand lightyears ago is unlikely, not to say impossible. Than again, it may be a natural phenomena just like the scientist said and though it's not as sexy, everything we know point in that direction."
"There's beyond the azzure blue a God concealed from human sight. He tinted sky with heavy hue and framed the world with His great might. 

His wisdom is beyond searching"
"يَا مَعْشَرَ الْجِنِّ وَالْإِنْسِ إِنِ اسْتَطَعْتُمْ أَنْ تَنْفُذُوا مِنْ أَقْطَارِ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ فَانْفُذُوا ۚ لَا تَنْفُذُونَ إِلَّا بِسُلْطَانٍ

O ye assembly of Jinns and men! If it be ye can pass beyond the zones of the heavens and the earth, pass ye! not without authority shall ye be able to pass!"
How do you get the data I wonder .. as a data analyst I would have some fun with this .. All you need is 2 more concurrent view points and you could draw the shape and size of the planet :-)
Imagination. From so called experts. It’s frightening.
"It is very important to use the Science for the trues and the right thing, which will make us happy. If you take a look to Dr. Prof. Werner Gitt... https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oCb_paIRnQ&t=76s"

LOL
Phd's just had to get over their egos to allow  Amateurs to discover. Most of the celestial objects are discovered by them anyway. A grad student presented the first black hole images then the PhD steals the show. An Astronomer who does not believe in the possibility of other organisms out there definitely sold out. Not the kind of free thinking I see from TED but then again there are Leaders and there are Sheeple
They would be Chinese building another mega structure.
Can this alien civilization end schools on Earth?
CAN YOU CONSTRUCT A PLANET AND PUT ITIN THE ORBIT?
those are aliens who built their new planet AROUND STAR
"These guys have observed millions of stars.. and one out of millions is just oddly different..
No wonder they got excited so much, i can feel my whole imagination swallowing me.."
"Here TED put this out there to the communities, take all the data or either on clear nights in said citizen observatory cities and get on one network an Operating management system created just for these nights and at the same time everyone logs on and points to the same area and collect all the data possible.. BAM! Instant huge satellite telescope.."
It’s a galactic fleet/war!
"what if what is blocking the light in random patterns is not spherical? just another gigantic rock but oddly shaped that is spinning, no aliens., unless,, are you an alien?"
Couldn’t it be several planets passing the star at the same time but different speeds on different ellipticals? Kinda like when we have a planetary alignment?
Interstellar
I like her shoes🤣🤣🤣
So dumb
This reminds me about a poem i once wrote... (I was the only star in space) check it out on my channel
"How about massive asteroids closer to Earth than that star ? The moon is small and fully covers many stars when it crosses the sky - To build structures that dim a star you need to entitely mine many whole planets, just to save one planet needs ? You need more energy and materials for that work than the ones that star provides on the time you setup the structures, its like using your car gas tank for 5.000 miles just to get an AAA battery when all that gas could run your home"
"If aliens ever come, and we still have assholes like the Al Quida thugs and the fat assed North Korean despot Kim Jong ILL  still operating on our planet, we will look like dangerous animals.
Might be our doom."
"What if to the Nth power..... Bogus science. Just guess work. Sadly, this is what we are delegated to.
Maybe in the future we will be able to get resolution to the extent we can acquire truly factual data. For now, it's all supposition and hypothesis.
Sadly, scienctists today have built their foundations on too many layers of hypothesis and ""theory"" rather than rock solid data. 💔"
Nasty
2 minutes in and as usual I can't stomach the bullshit
Ted Talks...NWO leftist run propaganda bullsh*it
Science is synonymous with deception and manipulation in the West~
Sounds like she's telling a rehearsed fairytale and if she's with NASA they are a bunch of liars anyways
"I love that Tabitha, herself, is presenting this amazing discovery they made concerning star “KIC -8462852”, now appropriately dubbed “Tabby’s Star’! The bizarre structure that seems to surround the Tabby’s Star” is seen via Kepler, as it emanates this anomaly, which is what seems like SIGNIFICANT rotational dips in light, like one might see observing our star and say Jupiter’s rotation around it only on a far more MASSIVE scale, from the Cygnus constellation!  
What I found astonishing is also, get this...so far it appears that BOTH the Egyptian Pyramids and newly re-discovered Gobeckli Tepi, are aligned to this constellation!! 
Even ancient cave drawings and several ancient civilizations also make reference to the Cygnus constellation! 
What I’m wondering is “Who” came up with the Zodiacal names of these star systems??? How is it we refer to the Cygnus constellation as a flying bird, just as the very ancient did, which is encouraging because it tells us we still have this connection to our ancient past when it comes to the cosmos and our perception of them!  The fact that the ancients, who likely sought refuge in caves, etc., presumably after the last earth shattering catastrophe, also knew - even way back then of these associations, is encouraging! We are a species with amnesia but thankfully this doesn’t have to be a permanent state, I do believe we are waking up from the latest disaster created “Coma” and are quickly regaining ground! While it baffles the mind that not only is a dyson  sphere observed, on KIC -8462852, there are also “signals” that appear to be broadcasting numerical equations corresponding to the number 11 and that also relate to the Great Pyramids,  Gobeckli Tepi, and itger ruuns such as Baàlbek/Heliopolis! 
Now Come on, Tabby, it’s as if you’ve been programmed to state, “it’s not aliens”.... but while your words may say “it’s a natural phenomenon”, your own vibrational emissions scream It’s ALIENS, as in an INTELLIGENTY CREATED STRUCTURE!!! “, I wish mainstreams science could wrap it’s programmed mind around this, OUR TRUTH CAN ONLY BE DISCOVERED IF WE MERGE OUR HARDCORE SCIENCE MINDSET WITH INHERENT PROFOUND AND COSMICALLY CONNECTED SPIRITUALITY!” Our ancestors knew far more about the cosmos, were far more connected to nature and the stars, understanding we must work in concert with nature, our planet, and its natural environment, and the cosmos as they seem to have successfully merged the “Spiritual with the Scientific”, thus creating a fascinating and compelling hypothesis of ever entangled, inner connectedness, a school of phenomenal thought! So far removed from where mainstream science is today, albeit, as we discover more and more ancient ruins, we are ever so slowly, digging in our philosophical heels, having to be dragged, resisting and kicking and screaming the whole way, towards our actual TRUTH, one that is far more incredible than we will ever subscribe to,  if we continue to stay embedded as we are now, in this limiting “Newtonian” hypothesis which promotes so much separation, randomness and dividing, we find ourselves spinning in circles and not really explaining bubkas!"
Amazing!
She’s a lunatic
"With the amount of stuff in space between Kepler and that star. It could be anything. It doesn't have to be things revolving around that star. A closer object (rogue planet, comet, etc..) passing in-between the line of sight of Kepler and the star would easily explain that 15% drop. Any astrophysicist that said it was aliens must be completely brain dead..."
Shes an Alien but we don't know yet
The title should be mysterious planet.
"i was under the belief that element 115 used right, generates zero heat"
"The Bible says Eve was was the mother of all living. There isn't live on other planets. The UFO's are the fallen angels roaming the earth to seek who they can destroy.  Don't be fooled by the lights zooming in the heavens. It's just another attempt to confuse your love for our true creator.  The I AM, YESHUA OUR SAVIOR.  The Redeemer of our souls."
"I should have been a scientist, that way I could have made a lot of money doing nothing but telling people bullshit. To think I spent almost 30 years in the high stess printing industry, until computers put me out of a job. Then worked constitution for 15 years, all of the time I could have made a lot of money as a bullshit artist like scientists, politicians, or even a school teacher."
"Makes sense that an object is coming between us and this star.  BUT why does it have to be in near orbit around the star? Seems like A much smaller object passing nearer to earth would give the same affect.   But that would likely affect many stars light output, unless it took exactly the right path to only affect one star?  Just thinking out loud."
What if its just a kuiper belt object that caused that?? I think it makes sense
"perhaps there star got to big as the same is about to happen to our sun in billions of years, and perhaps they build a giant space umbrella to create some shade :)
otherwise it would be the biggest BBQ ever :)"
"Have you guys considered a black hole causing this phenomena or perhaps multiple of them?
or would that give a way different dim in light in the spectrum?"
Thank you!
Interesting l like this
"Wow, such poor science."
"Nel nostro Universo (DERN) non ci sono pianeti abitabili, ma bisogna cercarli nell'Universo (DAL) gemello del nostro, ma si trova in un'altra dimensione spazio-tempo e avanti di 0,5 secondi.  Buona ricerca, quando trovate le porte dimensionali sarete a un buon punto, ma ci vorranno ancora millenni.🛸🖖"
"In our Universe (DERN) there are no habitable planets, but we need to look for them in the Universe (DAL) twin of ours, but it is in another space-time dimension and ahead of 0.5 seconds.  Good research, when you find the dimensional doors you will be well advanced, but it will still take millennia"
Everything that uses mass amounts of energy produces heat? that you know of
What that swarm of comets was the result of some massive collision that also sent ‘Oumuamua to our solar system
She will make the same seminars with the same theory for the rest of her life. Nice job for someone to live.
DYSON SPHERE? WHAT SHES WEARING? I MEAN YOUR GIVING A PRESENTATION PUT ON CLOTHES THAT FIT MAMA...DANG AND IF YOUR PREGO APOLOGIES IN ADVANCE
"What if it's a strange-shaped rogue planet much closer to hubble, blocking the view...?"
a large planet with large moons circling a large star?
Bob Lazar said there was no heat coming off the reacter
"So the graph showed here is what our scientist actually see when observing the universe , and then they make artist renditions of the graph read outs ok 👍🏼 got it so does this mean I owe any flat earth believers an apology? because they where called stupid for saying the pics and video of other planets up close look fake"
09 - 11 - 13 ... 15? 17? 19?
Could it be that We as Human are Feeding it for the Matrix structure???
there are no Aliens. TED is bs.
"1. What we say extraterrestrial is actually terrestrial. 
2. We are still trying to find them if as according to us if exsist .
3. To me they knew everything about us . We are just there experimental .
4. Then what is it they are looking for.  They final result out of the earth laboratory."
"Simply a mundane video of a scientist explaining the scientific frustration behind the inconclusive endevour they pirsued. Everything explained here are easily accessible through science channels these days. It clears out no points, no aims, no deductions, no certain outcomes. Poor talk."
Are angels aliens?
I really really enjoyed spending time in my evenings as a planet hunter.  Thank you for putting it out there! ❤️
"Somebody played ""Stellaris"" 🤔"
I find all of this extremely fascinating. What would they be using to capture solar energy?  Stars are hot are very hot how could they put some things around the star that would not melt. It would have to be an extremely different type of metal. They would have to be able to melt and shape it. Then put it around the star. Interesting!!!
What a load of nonsense!
"It’s funny watching educated people go crazy😉. We fund a lot of science wanting to figure out if life is elsewhere, but then anybody that says they saw an alien is a crazed lunatic.  And for this science show, we spend billions of our dollars, perhaps spent better to take care of the blue ball we actually live on...."
"How can you know something by observation alone ? Your thesis is flawed and inconclusive , you have judged a star ie book by its cover !"
"Half way through the presentation I was thinking that what they had found would have been a binary star if the second star had ignited,"
Ahhhh so that was what that viral facebook spam article about. A theory about megalithic alien structure around a star. I thought it was just some crazy nut job fake news. Never knew it was grounded on real research.
Bcoz alien ships were blocking the light
Mark of the beast for everyone they're so happy
Umm I wouldn't call that an efficient use of resources...
Its a giant flat planet! Sometimes it transit on its flat side and sometimes on its round side
"why could it not be long wide object of mass that is not RoUnD making the orbit. assuming that all planets are round or as unknowns ... may not be as a planet but a orbiting mass that is ...say a Flatt type structure of mass, with or without  possible thick clouds of dust . be cool if it was a stretched out form of metallic that cooled down very fast after its melted bang point then thrown out as a whole instead of pieces."
"... Carl Sagan was paraphrasing Steven Weinberg - the originator of the quote: ""Extraordinary claims require Extraordinary evidence""."
Could it be just a star which is loosing its light because it's orbiting near a black hole ?
"What you saw was a black hole orbiting a star, and at one time swalow a plantet that intersect its orbit. 
No dust, no particles."
The universe is an unfolding mystery limited by our obsession with its outer form..
"If we communicate with them, they may just send back space bots to exterminate all life on Earth."
"Couldn't it have been caused by moons circling the planet, sometimes the blocking effect being hidden by the planet and sometimes not?"
"Useless...I tell an intriguing story, then drop hints about a need for money.  Science? Sales pitch? Garbage...I would feel so dirty and cheap..."
"No comets, no planets, no aliens.

Those were two dirt spots on the telescope.
👏
Best explanation."
"DUR, There are Multiple planets transiting in front of the star at different times and different sizes. BOOM MIC DROP!"
"I think Kepler does not show us everything, or what is more likely, the pictures we get to see are edited so we do not see what's really out there."
Thought Christopher Walken was the most mysterious star in the universe
Could it be some space debris much nearer to the telescope rather than something closer to the star.
"Note: suggestions and opinions are not truth.
Most mysterious stars (the false lights, like their spiritual father satan) in existence: Hollywood celebrities (people acting and getting paid for not producing anything of real value and wreaking havoc in the world, just like their new world order leaders and their tools/weapons/henchmen/women)."
"The method they developed for Kepler is FATALLY flawed. Even the best telescopes cannot resolve a planet orbiting a distant star. The rely on the transit method, which tracks reduction in light output from the star, and assume it is caused by object passing between the star and us observing the light. The claim from this is, that the orbiting object is in the same plane as our line of sight, and the transit dimming is caused by a full eclipse of the star by that object. But they have NO WAY to verify this. What happens when the dimming observed is caused by a partial eclipse of the star? ALL the data is JUNK at that point. I have pointed this out to more than one scientist on the project and they refuse to address this fact. The grant money must be kept flowing."
"It makes perfect sense that any advanced technology over a long period of time would require a very large amount of energy to exist and survive. Only stars have the capability to produce an indefinite reliable source of energy to satisfy these requirements.If advanced civilizations exist that most likely are thousands or even millions of years older  than ours, then it is reasonable to assume the ability and need to tap energy from stars would be likely."
Personally think this is the start of a black hole.   They suck up enegry and  pair up with another star.
"Dark galaxy is a speedy galaxy that moves faster than light. In the rest frame of the dark galaxy, the earth is moving faster than light. No light from the galaxy can catch up with the earth. This is why it is dark.
https://sites.google.com/view/physics-news/home/dark-galaxy"
"Bla bla bla bla rubbish. Pure assumptions of stupid epic romantic adventures. Data cant be lost. Anyone with basic knowledge of computer science knows how data is stored. Data can never be deleted. There is not technology for that. The operating system only  get the permission to write new data ""ontop"".  So NOOO Nasa didn't loose any data. All lies."
How they can say *in the universe* when it is impossible to prove. There's no way they can tell
It might not be so great to find alien life. Look what happened to the American Indians.
"She is right, a computer even in its AI form, cant ""think"" like its creator, the Human Brain. This theorey is based on years of research and solid data and it will go further. Good to wait and watch."

ATOMIC WAR PREDICTION – MATT. 13V24-30 – 14/05/2023.





 





Hi Brethren,





Facebook would not
allow my links because of the very Bitter Gospel Truth. So, if you want this
article in full, please visit my Youtube channel; nijjhar1. Search in Google,
Nijjhar, predictions.





 





The Bible has all the answers for the twice-born of the
holy spirit, “common sense” or Surti.





 





“CHOSEN PEOPLE” have the Keys
to this Secret: - Abram = Adam, Sarah = Eve and Promised Land = Garden of Eden.
“Abraham” is the “Father of the Faithful”.





 





Watch my Youtube videos on Hajj for “The Kingdom of
Heaven”:-





ISRAEL WAS ESTABLISHED ON 14/05/1948 + 70 YEARS OF
FULL PROTECTION TO MAY, 2018. Youtube Video: - 





 





Then, Real
Tribulations world had never seen before for FIVE years to May 2023 when ATOMIC
WAR COULD TAKE PLACE. Our Supernatural Father God (Elohim, Allah, ParBrahm,
etc.) knows better. 





Grim American
Jewish Reaper waving sickle to kill more in Venezuela as they did in Iraq,
Libya, Syria, Ukraine, etc.





 





REMEMBER THAT PROPHET ELIJAH, JOHN, THE BAPTIST CAME
TO LOOK AFTER THE CREATION OF DEMIURGE LORD YAHWEH, BRAHMA, KHUDA, ETC. FOR
REINCARNATION WHILST OUR ANOINTED ELDER BROTHER CHRIST JESUS DELIVERED US
GOSPEL OF OUR SUPERNATURAL FATHER FOR SONS OF ELOHIM, ALLAH, PARBRAHM, ETC. FOR
RESURRECTION. No raw brick, no baked brick; no born of water, no born of Allah.





KUDRATT KHUDAYE
DI (NATURAL CREATION FLESH + SOUL IS OF YAHWEH); NOOR BY GRACE IS OF ALLAH





(FLESH + SOUL +
HOLY SPIRIT, WHICH IS COMMON SENSE, SURTTI, ETC.)





 





Over 7000
Youtube Videos; channel nijjhar1. Free Seminars. Email:- Nijjhar@gmail.com





 





What is the Gospel Truth?





 





Truths are of two
types; natural truth that applies to the physical nature of Yahweh, Brahma,
Khudah, etc., which is “seen” by the two natural eyes and it is “relative”. The other is spiritual Truth, which is of our Supernatural
Father God (Elohim, Allah, ParBrahm, etc.) and as it is Light, NOOR, it is only
“perceived” by the Third eye of logical reasoning; no relativity applies to
this “Absolute Truth”. 





 





Here is a video:-





 





Donald Trump would make Jews run for Israel to fulfil
Matt. 13v24-30, which Hilary couldn't.





 





Child-like Donald Trump
has pressed the Tribulations Button on 14/05/2018 by declaring Jerusalem to be
the Capital:-





Seven simple questions:-





1.            What
is the difference between Yahweh, Brahma, Khudah, etc. and Elohim, Parbrahm,
Allah, etc.?





2.            What
is the difference between a Priest and a Royal Priest?





3.            Why
Yahweh created Adam first and Eve out of the rib of Adam and not both together?





4.            Why a
woman cannot “teach” the moral laws of Moses/Scriptures but she could “Preach”
Gospel?





5.            Why
Jesus made a whip and beat the traders when He Preached that if someone hits
you on one cheek then present the other?





6.            What
are the names of the Prodigal son, his elder brother and the father?





7.            What
is the difference between the “kingdom of heaven” of the Rabbis and the “Royal
Kingdom of God” that Jesus ushered in? 





Why Jesus is not the Lord: - In Jesus, we have One Father
and we are His sons and not the slaves that are not allowed into the House of
our Father."

"""Imagine a civilization more advanced than us."" 

Lol, it's hard to imagine civilizations less advanced than us. We can't even produce a single megalith. Not to mention the idiocy of the Dark Ages and the hinderence of worship itself. When did man become so pale and ungrateful?"
It's disappointing how the the transit and wobble methods of finding exoplanets and the theories that they rely on for accuracy (ignoring ad hoc) are never questioned under these inordinate circumstances. Instead great credence is given to the pointlessness of pondering the notion of extraterrestrial explanations...
"Her remarks at the end of the video about citizen astronomers put a smile on my face, as no one astronomer is less worthy than another; irregardless of credentials - because anyone can make an observation and anyone can hypothesize a theory."

Tramp damage to Amerika may be irreversible by now....just read the comments here....trampanzees galore....jejejej
She had me untill she said Earth's moon forming event....
"Just because a star dims doesn’t mean it’s been transited.  Stars change shape and color drastically many times per second.  Look yourself with a Nikon p900; stars aren’t far off suns. As always, the conclusion’s they leap to are ridiculous."
how far away is that star? how soon can we get there? and can i upload myself into a robot that can survive to be the one to see it? :)
"After I've watched this video , I use my binocular ! Suddenly ,  I've discovered a huge glowing star like object just above me and I've name it  WTF !"
What is the possibility that we are witnessing a planetary conjunction? As if planets similar to Jupiter and Saturn were both passing in front of the star at the same time?
All the stars are fixed in their place
"""... however, further analysis based on data through the end of 2017 showed wavelength-dependent dimming consistent with dust but not an opaque object such as an alien megastructure, which would block all wavelengths of light equally."""
where would they get materials for those ginormous superstructures?
that was 3 years ago any new data ?
And we saw black hole.
It’s not a truly remarkable it’s a truly unimportant for humankind

"Our society is plagued by violence and destruction, and many people think it's human nature. If I were an extraterrestrial from a consciously advanced civilization, I would stay as far away as possible from our planet. Just because we don't see beings from outer space in our daily lives doesn't mean they don't exist, they just don't want to become victims of our barbaric behavior. Yet, what if there are non-human beings already living amongst us and they just don't want to show themselves for fear of our stupidity?"
"Let me guess, it's a Kardashian."
wastage of time and money..
My first thought is there may be something different/wrong/asymmetric with the actual star ...not an object in front of it
"So, she can hypothesize that an advanced alien civilization built these ginormous structures around a star 1,500 light years away, but let's not even consider the notion that advanced alien civilizations could ever build space-faring craft that could travel to Earth. Because that would be like, Roswell and tinfoil hats and all that woo-woo stuff."

Lightning bugs emit almost 100% of the energy they produce as light and not heat..if they can do it it can be duplicated.
Maybe it's a unformed planet or one that has shattered due to some naturally occurring event? Just have a hard time believing any civilization would waste time and resources building a Dyson sphere or Halo. Any civilization that could build such a structure would have mastered interstellar flight and used it to settle a new world.
Or they could be solar sails or just massive passive structures meant to signal to other intelligent species. See also this https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/11/harvard-researchers-see-alien-potential-in-mysterious-object/
This is one of the best TED talks I've heard in some time.  :)
"Perhaps it’s s star with numerous various sized planets that all line up from time to time . Looking end on , from ,  time to time , this will occasionally interrupt the light in various strengths as viewed from the earth .
   That’s my theory anyway.
Perhaps this is the explanation. ."
I smell bullshit
"I was surprised after watching the video that this possibility was not shared. If earth is reasonably close to being aligned with the orbits of planets around KIC 8462852, why not consider that multiple planets have become aligned in such a way as to strongly affect the light drop shown by having however many form a line obscuring far more light than a single planet would? There is also the possibility of several asteroid belts aiding in the results."
Earth does not move. The sun moves around the Earth. The sun is very close to earth.

"I have another theory:  I don't know the actual distances, but let's say this star is 1000 light years from earth.  Now let's say there is another star which is 100 light years from earth and the line of sight to this closer star is close (but not coinciding) to the line of sight of the farther star.  Now let's say that this closer star has a planet whose trajectory crosses the line of sight of the farther star.  Wouldn't this give similar results to what is being seen here?"
"In our DERN Universe there are no habitable planets, but we must look for them in the Universe DAL our twin's, but it is in another space-time dimension and ahead of 0.5 seconds.  Good research, when you find the dimensional doors you will be well advanced, but it will still take millennia. 🛸🖖"
NASA MISSION??????
"Do the planets not line up in our own solar system. So a small planet moves across as a larger one moves slightly faster between it and the star. then maybe a larger one moves really fast in front of the small planet. maybe the speeds of the orbit of all of the planets around that star cause them to line up and pass each other more frequently than as do our very own planets . a small example ,  One calculation of alignments within around thirty degrees (about as close as they can get) shows that the last such alignment was in 561 BC, and the next will be in 2854. The eight planets plus Pluto are somewhat aligned every 500 years, and are grouped within 30 degrees every one to three alignments.   So it is possible what they saw was exactly this , As the planets aligned and then moved out of alignment. I hate the way most people overthink things,"
"So this proves NASA etc has no real photos in space, merely mapped by soundwaves/CGI...?"
Basically ...HI GUYS I GET PAID TO TELL YOI WE DONT FUCKING KNOW  WHATS OUT THERE 😂
I stopped watching when she mentioned NASA.
1) How can they tell that the object or objects are close to the star? 2) Could this be some kind of asteroid belt around this star?

I don't see how scientist csnt figure this out. These lights are a S.O.S. They needed help because the planet was dieing or its too populated or something bad was coming to destroy it. But this was 13000 years ago based on how light reflects through space.

Where is the planet where this artificial mega- structure belong to? Find the planet first.
"A debris field of two collided celestial bodies (two large solid planets now shattered into pieces) in an elliptical shape trapped orbiting the star would create such a light diminishing pattern. As far as the time period. The closer the object is to the sun, the longer it blocks light. The further the object, the shorter the duration. I don't feel like doing the math to give exact times and sizes, but you get the idea, and using some calculations you could recreate the hypothetical cloud of debris. So, two planets collided and created a large debris field around what remains of their cores so that gravity keeps them and their debris dancing around each other in a tight elliptical orbit (think rings of Saturn on a massive debris scale and angled in such a way as to create this light pattern to observers here). Highly plausible considering there's a high probability of many rogue planets drifting between solar systems, ejected by larger bodies in their host systems to drift alone through space until a sun draws them in (an event that may have very well occurred in our own solar system to give our current planetary alignments to the sun). If aliens were sufficiently advanced to build a structure so large, they'd be more likely to build a Dyson sphere and you wouldn't see the star at all because they'd be absorbing most of it's energy."
"Maybe it's where Sciencefictology's Evil Lord Xenu resides.... :-D Seriously, though. Imagine the logistics (let alone the reasoning) behind producing a ""structure"" a hundred times bigger than a very large planet. You'd need to find at least tens of thousands of planets with _suitable_ minerals and destroy them to extract the materials for such a structure.Such an advanced civilisation would need unimaginable resources and technology to undertake that feat AND at the same time assume no realistic threats to put all their eggs in one basket. This doesn't even take the physics like gravity into account."

8 God called the vault “sky.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the second day.
9 And God said, “Let the water under the sky be gathered to one place, and let dry ground appear.” And it was so.

"Isn't it possible that somewhere between the mystery star and Earth there is another star system? We know that Neptune is almost 3 billion miles away from our sun. If a planet is orbiting the sun in that middle system (yet is billions of miles away from that sun), its orbit may line up in the path between the mystery star and our Earth. Maybe many planets in that star system also cause the dimming of that mystery star. And yet, we wouldn't see the star itself in that middle system. Sorry, kinda hard to put into words."
I guess I just don’t understand
This is an example of what we can accomplish when we all work together instead of against each other.  Now let's go terraform Mars.

Why must the obstruction be something near the star?  Perhaps something within our own system is responsible.  Jupiter could obscure the star up to 100%.  Saturn's rings could easily result in the appearance of a non-spherical object.

"So we’re dealing with something unimaginabe. I highly doubt an asteroid or comet field can dip the star at such a huge magnitude. Also, the dip in brightness has increased greatly over the years. So you’re telling me, the comet field is growing? Bullshit...space is constant. Very little changes. When you see massive double digit percentage dips in brightness within transits over the years. It infers that whatever is causing it is growing in size. Well...planets don’t grow in size. Asteroid/Comet fields don’t grow either. At least not in a few years time. If it was a new star then it’d make sense with the huge clouds of dust dimming the new star. However this is not a new star. So it appears something is being built. This is coming from a Astrophysics major at U of A."

You didn't find a star. You've got an agenda to bamboozle idiots with a lot of what if bullshit.
"No astronomer I, but Boyajian strangely does not address the lack of periodicity of these transits, which would be fundamental to discussions of orbit and size (along with mass and density and opaqueness). This is why those stupid computers would miss them. Clearly an interstellar, non-orbiting transient much, much smaller than an orbiting ""alien megastructure"" would cause non-periodic but similar immense transits. Large dust clouds would also cause asymmetric occlusions, like observed, and strike me as much more likely to be commonplace (at the astronomical scale).

It's almost like this is a semi-conscious, less-than-rigorous, populist false narrative promoted by astronomers to recover some of the government funding largesse from climate change researchers."

In my opinion, some people know the truth, but not many and They are not public people that you would know by name or look. On the other hand, we the people don't know anything at all. We are given a handful of tools (some math, some approved dictated historical books, pharmaceutical tools, basic tools), and the rest is hidden or truly unknown or both. We, the masses, are in the dark and don't know. Seek truth because it's not in front of you. And by the way, I'm not sure that the definition of a star is even remotely accurate."

With the data that you presented. What made you think aliens? Isn't it possible that other more reasonable conclusions should have been considered first. Anyhow I would call this speculation not science.
Perhaps that Solar system’s own ‘Kuiper Belt’ or the crossing anomaly could be light years closer to us and not  to that sun - it simply crosses our plane as if an eclipse. A small object closer to us would most certainly block more than its size against the background of a star much much further away - unless it can be proven that this anomaly is in fact within that system?

She’s boring.
The observable time frame we see on earth is distorted by distance and object time distortion at the place of observation.. the dips in light would never be consistent ..the true result would be to include the total amount of planetary mass orbiting the star..then the size of the star..then the distance from the observable position..then the true time frame can be calculated. Space time is not a sett speed..our own spacecraft in orbit experience time moving at a different pace only a fraction of the distance from earth  that distorts space time on its own level.

So I have a hypothesis of my own. What this astronomer is talking about is God <3 She needs to study English and take classes to improve her vocabulary and sentences. As soon as she mentioned nasa she lost my interest. Most scientists do not believe in God or the existence of God. The bottom line is according to her information that I have many doubts about, there is something happening out there that they can't explain. The intrusions in my computer are so bad I can't go to the bathroom without company watching. My information on the UFO and ET contact is all TRUTH, that's why the intrusions are there, and I have photos and videos to prove that and the existence of other celestial objects that are not ours. I've said so many times here and other places that ET is here so why are we still looking millions of light years into space for them. They will keep you all in the dark forever if they could however now they cannot and so screw them and lets find the TRUTH of EVERYTHING that we've been lied to about and bring Mother Earth back to her natural state when there wasn't any darkness upon her. We can do that with prayer, we can stop polluting as a population, and love and respect and honor her. As a matter of interest this video has over 4 million views. That's over 4 million people that will probably believe this because they call themselves astronomers and mentioned nasa."
It’s me i drank a lot and my pee went across too far in the galaxy.
As soon as she said Earth moon forming event lost interest. The moon is artificial.
"This ""mysterious"" light curve seems very straight forward to me.

Given the amount of possible objects within a solar system, collisions are common. So what if two large enough planets collided outside the light curves ""view"". The planets collide on opposite orbits slowing the orbit of both to a percentage of the greater mass planet's original orbital speed. This slows down the debris from the collision of the planets. Gravity attracts more and more mass to the slow moving field of debris and enlarges the area of light obscured by the debris. And overtime the debris disperses into an asteroid belt.

Point blank if there is a more advanced species out there anywhere near us even as far as our satellites can reach dont you think they already know we're here and just dont want to know us and probably can avoid us finding them. If I were an advanced species way out there I would stay far away from this barbaric planet that's just gonna die out from killing itself. Js 🤷‍♂️
I thought this was going to be about Micheal Jackson
Are they assuming that all planetary systems work and move the same? Cause they likely don't.  Can this thing tell when multiple planets in crossing orbits travelling at proportional speeds but not along the same plane cross the star? I love the idea of aliens but I think it highly unlikely that we could even spot the star in the first place in that scenario. We are just not that clever yet.

Can’t explain it? ‘It must be alien intelligence” - scientists. 🙄 🤦‍♂️
Dyson sphere.
yawn
I'm glad that's explained 🙄
There are huge alienships drawing power from our sun as well it's just they'll never reveal that data. There's a clip of one here- https://youtu.be/SHJiuiSAmTA
"It's funny how scientist are still scared to suggest alien life without being laughed at. They see billions of stars with planets and billions galaxys with billions of stars. I think the chances of life are way more greater than percieved.  Given the time our universe is believed to of existed. We are only at a certain evolutionary level due to a few early extinction events that took millions of years to recover( one of which killed off over 80 percent of life),  a few points in our own history that set us back( Ice age, and dark ages). Another planet could be hundreds to millones of years ahead of us if the didn't experience extinction events or the evolved in a more unified social structure."

"Jupiter will surely eclipse any star, yet she says it made some percentage drop in brightness ?.
  2) what are the chances of the orbit of a star's planet being in a plane that includes this microscopic planet,  Earth ?.
  Completely ludicrous, silly Cow.  Probably the one that jumped over the Mooooo - n !  LMAO"
Can the star be shorting out?
"I like her.  Shes genuine.  When she says , meaning non degreed people, helped.   Degreed people need to prove their degree, whereas non degreed people seem to have a more love and feeling for their research. They typically can see things that people who have to justify the money spent on an education can't.  I have workwd with many , so called ""educated"" people,  and they normally have had  zero soft skills and can't relate to real world data versus text book data.

We, as a species,  rely more on so called science and not so much biblical data.   Our ancestors were not stupid....  Man knew about stars and space way before NASA and so called educated ivy league people.  They were able to do things that we still can't do or answer for using modern tech.

At least she admits mere man helped,  versus degreed ivy leagers who look good on paper but typically have crap for common sense abilities ..."
"Could it be that a planet much closer to our perspective passed by? Which would create this style of loss of light. 

The object doesnt need to be massive to do this, it would just need to be closer to us than the star you are observing. Ex, I can make the sun disappear with a baseball over my eye. My eye being the Kepler satellite with the camera we are using to view, and the baseball at an arm's length away can create the same senario."
NASA...I'm out..bullshit alert.
"First question: Does Kepler see in 2D or 3D?....2D would make depth an issue as closer objects would seem larger.

Second question: Can time distort the data? As there is a difference in speed that certain types of light travel, it might be some of the data might be distorted by some light particles arriving faster than other.

Conclusion: The most probable cause of the anomalies, was probably human error either on the gathering and, or the interpretation of the data."
Our 'universe' is a star. Everything is made of light. Come on people. The 'big bang' was a supernova. Figure out the rest
"Theres one thing thats missing. This happened how many light years ago? Now I'm no expert on time and light, but wouldn't that mean this happened a long lime ago and it probably isn't there now?"
Or smeone just put a 1 in the code in the wrong place.
The Silmarillion explains everything we need to know about the Universe.
"The government want us to believe that we will one day need to be saved from UFOs but it's going to cost us, but before that happens they will save us from an astroid. That will also cost us.  But it not just the money they want us to believe that God was going to let us die and that it was science that saved the world."
"Hmm. I am thinking if we go biblical... Jesus, hmm new Jerusalem? The mystery? The Bible says we will all see it from Earth and every knee will bow....the Heavens are definitely speaking these days... So AWESOME"
BS from people desperate to keep being funded!
I enjoy listening to Tabetha Boyajian talking and explaining anything astronomy.
The data was good because they made it up so yeah the data was good and accurate.  She forgot to say that. Man this is so much bullshit

There is a planet partially tidal locked. It finally broke apart."
"My money is on a black hole that has an unstable orbit or wobble. Only thing that fits the behaviour based on the information i have seen. Anything that size would have a crazy gravitational field that wouldnt allow the light to snap back like that, it would cause a lens effect on exit as well as the entrance. A black hole could cause the yoyo signature in theory provided it had a wobble or rotation."

"whats happening to the spectra lines emission and absorption, is there any erratic behaviour in these lines? what stellar classification is this star, size, temp etc, ,  ok F3V star at 450 parsec distance apparent magnitude 11.7  hmmmm thinking along lines of a large super massive dark companion that is dragging a large dust or comet swarm with it, in an irregular orbit, a wobbling semi complete ""c"" shaped ring of stellar detritus!! i will think about this one for a while. or it could be aliens (nahhh) but could be? lol dyson sphere/shell????
Maybe we should also be concentrating the kepler search for ""off the grid"" erratic behaviours like this one, because even if most have a natural explanation we may find there are many many more erratics out there, as stated the computer search would have missed this one, and if there is one out there there will be more stars showing such pseudo/actual alien behaviours. that could become interesting indeed.."

If one were to spend 1hr reading Halton Arps work, or Hannes Alfvens, Wal Thornhill, Anthony Peratt, The Burbidges etc. You'd realize we don't and can't know what or how the universe works.

Alien's exist.
Nearly every scientist you could speak would say this hypothesis of aliens is using the OPPOSITE of science. This hypothesis leaps to a reason we would assume is the most unlikely (based on the fact NO aliens have been found) whereas MANY times unexplained phenomena turned to be some OTHER natural cause so we should go ahead with that statistically LIKELY reason until proven otherwise.

The word planetes wth some reference from: https://www.space.com/5743-storied-history-word-planet.html


""The word""planet"" has meant many different things over the millennia and evenstill its definition is evolving.
The word istypically traced back to the ancient Greeks, who believed the Earth wasstationary at the center of the universe while objects in the sky revolvedaround it. The Greek term asters planetai mean ""wanderingstars"" and described the tiny lights that moved across the sky moredramatically than stars when compared over weeks and months. These wanderingstars, back then, amounted to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn""

Copernicus was a shill for the accepted wisdom until his time was that the earth is flat. Meaning the is has a flatish surface with irregularities.

True science is coming out of a heavy shell and is unveiling the Truth. Some say that the earth is a sphere but not how we were taught. The lower hemisphere is solid with valleys full of water and the top hemisphere empty of solid matter but where the atmosphere resides and covered with a hard Dome glass like where the *Planetes* reside as shimmering stars and not hard bodies. And check out any video that says the Sun is close and smaller. Open your understandings and your mind. Once yiu do that you'll  be free. But many like to be slaves and the idea of freedom scares them."
"Well,  I will take a guess.
 The star has its fusion chamber offset to the center of the star and this produces a rotation of the star similar to the ground bloom firework. This off center fusion chamber produces a imbalance in its electro magnetic field and this cause a abnormally high volume of solar flares. The offcenter fusion chamber also has a unusual effect on the gravitational field making debris / planets circling the star to behave erratic."
Seems to fit the description of a very small (so called) Black Hole.
Why is it always computer images? Why can't they show the thing they saw...?
I love videos like this..more entertaining than cable
0    infiniti     o      this would explain the light flux .......  think about this.

"Writing a comment almost rarely leads to anything productive...but, here I go. I love science AND I believe in creation. For me, the natural world screams of a creator. But here’s a “Ted” talk about observing something they barely detect, millions of miles away; that defies explanation. So, they take known evidence and come up with a hypothesis/theory. That it could be an unimaginable enormous structure called a Dyson’s sphere, surrounding a star that a super advanced civilization constructed. All to absorb the energy of said star. Maybe it’s true. That’d be fricken cool!! Any things possible. I believe in a all power God, through his will, with the elements at his disposal, created EVERYTHING and that in this universe, mystery will always abide. But, according to science...I’m intellectually defunct and inferior because of that belief. No matter what, faith is needed (this woman revealing her level of faith).

In fact, we are engineered by aliens which is why we are embedded with so much of rationality, cognition, logic and sense.

"All the stars and space itself is just an illusion. They are fake just like our world is. It’s all just a simulation. Did you know that a physicist named James Gates found computer codes embedded in the fabric of the universe? Also a experiment known as the “double slit experiment” proved that matter only come into existence when there is a sentient observer!? More and more physicists are finding evidence indicating that reality is a simulation. So all this research of space is a waste of time. Instead of chasing after illusions; all the resources should be directed towards finding solutions to end the simulated experiences of human suffering caused by simulated diseases, warfare, poverty etc. Because, even if all the sufferings are just temporary simulated experiences; they experience itself is undeniable and therefore worth getting rid of. I think the test of man in here is to test a ment (test mankinds’s ment(al)) capacity. There was a Old Testament and now we are in a New Testament simulation. It is testing mankind’s mental capacity to find the solution to all the negative things that have been simulated for mankind to solve and re-enter the garden /paradise/ kingdom of Go0d. But unfortunately it seems that so far, mankind is failing because instead of working to regain the lost paradise; everybody is so busy trying to acquire gold/money. All nations and people are striving after gold because we believe that gold will buy us paradise. It’s like a woman who thinks you can buy heaven with gold sung about in “stairway to heaven”. But that will never work due to it being a very Individualistic selfish goal. The Bible tells us that the worst kind of idolatry (loving something more than anything else) is to worship a golden calf.  Why was a golden calf chosen instead of a full grown ox or a magnificent thing like a golden dragon or a majestic golden lion chosen to symbolize the idol? It’s Bc golden calf is an allegory describing gold/money. The number of livestock one possessed was the measure of wealth. Also a calf was chosen because just like a persons bank account or possessions; a calf can be fed and grown. An golden calf idol worship is a society where it’s peoples greatest goal is to grow their material wealth. A society where all the people constantly strive to feed and grow their bank accounts. I think this is a very accurate description of our world now wouldn’t you agree? Most evils in our world are caused by the desire to Cain/gain gold. What does the Bible tells us about the idolatrous people? They get destroyed! Why are people striving for money/gold? It’s not Bc people are inherently evil but it’s due to the helper created to help us live side by side. It’s Bc of the governments / social rules which make it impossible to adequately provide for yourself and your loved ones without having money. Because people’s love which makes them want to provide the best for their loved ones; they are forced into idolatry of worship the golden calf. The whole world’s Language is now United once more. The language of money. What happened to the world when the language was one and their building technology was greatly improved? It got destroyed. So it seems that mankind must stop its worship of the golden calf. Mankind must learn to love Goodness above all and worship Go0d above all. That is how mankind can pass the New Testament in this simulation."

The one thing that really set everything in motion was the name Tesla. Nikola Tesla? WHO? I use the Info Super Highway to find out who this Telsa guy is. I found what this man did well over 100 years ago to be amazing! Even more amazing was the name Tesla was never spoken of in school. Not even a brief mention and I went to school and lived about 5 miles from his famous Wardencliff tower and laboratory. Nikola Tesla would have to be one of the greatest scientists and inventors ever but his name was never mentioned anywhere. Einstein the patent clerk with his theory? In school they made this guy out to be the greatest mind that ever walked the earth. This could go on forever, so to get to my point.

like normal big planet it also has moons with varying rotation and size. so while it passes the start it would have variable dips in light.

"how do you recognize in what distance is object covering the star? I can cover the star even with my hand, I can cover even our Sun. And my hand is not so giant.

"What a magnificent presentation. Thank you Tabby. You didn’t mention the significance of the distance between the planet and it’s sun. In fact, what if the object obscuring sunlight isn’t even a planet belonging to this sun? That would explain why some transits take longer than others."
"⚠️  *_LATEST INFO ON THE “TABBY STAR” / KIC 8462852_**  | January 9, 2018*  ⚠️

TL:DR Final Conclusion = No Dyson Sphere, just a massive gas cloud.  🤨🤓

*– News of January 9, 2018 –*
Since September 2015, the Tabby star is subject to significant drops in brightness difficult to explain. Astronomers are accustomed to drops in brightness. When observing stars, the drops in luminosity are due, for example, to interactions with the atmosphere, or even to the planets that pass in front of their star. This is how planetary transits are located : they generate very low luminosity decreases, often less than 1%. But the observations of the Tabby star have shown that it can lose periodically up to 22% of its brightness.

Many hypotheses have been formulated to try to explain this phenomenon, including the possibility that the Tabby star is regularly obscured by artificial megastructures. The physicist Freeman Dyson had theorized this hypothesis in the early 1960s. According to him, a sufficiently advanced civilization would end up having energy needs of such a level that it should capture almost all the light emitted by its star. This would push this civilization to build gigantic structures surrounding its star.

The brightness declines of the Tabby star could have been due to a partial Dyson sphere or under construction. A team of astronomers led by Tabetha Boyajian, who made the original discovery, has just published a study on the cause of the phenomenon. This study was funded on Kickstarter : more than $ 100,000 was raised. The funds raised made it possible to observe KIC 8462852, the Tabby star, during 14 months. Four episodes of drop in brightness were observed. They are due to a gigantic cloud of dust. The new observation data show that the different colors of the light spectrum are blocked at varying intensities, which suggests that the body that blocks the light of this star is not opaque : it is at least partially transparent.

An extraterrestrial civilization around the Tabby star ?

*– News of May 23, 2017 –*
The Tabby star, also called KIC 8462852, put the community of scientists in turmoil in September 2015 : we have observed very significant variations in brightness, inexplicable with our current knowledge. Indeed, the brightness of the Tabby star dropped very quickly in the space of a few days, before returning to a normal level.

Such a phenomenon has been reproducing since 19 May this year and astronomers are still unable to find a rational explanation for it. So much so that the hypothesis of a megastructure of extraterrestrial origin that would regularly obscure the star is seriously considered by scientists…

It could indeed be a sphere of Dyson. Freeman dyson, an American physicist and mathematician, said a very advanced extraterrestrial civilization would be able to build a structure that partially or completely surrounds its star in order to harvest all the energy it produces. Such a structure would be likely to explain the variations of light observed around the Tabby star, but we must of course remain skeptical of such an explanation. An unknown natural phenomenon could be at the origin of these variations, although for the moment all the attempts of natural explanations did not resist to the observations made of the Tabby star."

"It can be solarwind. Or something much bigger, that block de light of the star....

"Thanks for the video! It's very interesting.


So, patterns... My purely uneducated guess:
May 2009, maybe large planet (or binary).  with a slow orbiting moon about 1/3 it's size (or most likely multiple moons) passing by extending the duration.
Mar 2011, likely same planet (this planet takes 22 earth months to orbit around the its star. position of the moons this time round is in front maybe, causing a larger dip, but aligning with the planet to explain the shorter duration.
Feb 2013, first dip is likely same planet (well, it's 22 earth months later, so patterns). 2nd and 3rd dips 20 + 50 days later could be 2 other planets in the solar system. Smaller planets, with slower orbits. Might be the moons as well. Hard to tell as there are no patterns observed yet."
I figured it out. God created it.

"I think you can rule out an object much closer than a planetary body orbiting the star as the culprit for blocking the light.

There are no known objects that big in space and obviously another star in the way wouldn't make it dimmer."

"THE GREAT FALLING AWAY SPOKEN OF IN THE BIBLE
Those interested in the signs of the end times often take note of a warning given by Paul to the Thessalonians, speaking about the return of Jesus Christ to earth. He writes, “Let no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first (2 Thessalonians 2:3). He then proceeds to explain this “falling away” in greater detail.
Paul writes that it will involve the revealing of “the man of sin…the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God” (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4). Some man is going to style himself as greater than God, pretending to be God—and people will believe him. 
Why? Because: HE IS THE GREATEST DECEIVER EVER. HE WILL COME TO EARTH AS AN ALIEN AND MAKE US BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE HIS DNA AND THAT WE ALL COME FROM IT. THE SEED OF CAINE SO TO SPEAK. THE GREAT FALLING AWAY WILL A CURE, MOSTLY BY SO CALLED BELIEVERS THAT NEVER REALLY DID. BUT HE WILL ALSO DECEIVE THE GREAT AND MIGHTY. THEY ACTUALLY STARTED THIS WAY BACK BEFORE I WAS BORN AND ARE CONTINUING WITH SHOWS LIKE THE X FILES AND UFO HUNTERS FIRST ONE I REMEMBER WAS THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 1951 @ THE LINK IF YOU ARE INTERESTED. https://youtu.be/UQYfqGksB_w"
"Is the most mysterious star not in fact 93 million miles away? Have they considered that the star was switching on and off as the cosmic Birkeland currents that perhaps sustains all stars flipps back and forth from a third body in equilateral proximity electrically. Remember the Parker probe is resolving the dilemma of the corona being 300 times hotter than the surface. Perhaps stars are powered by invisible Birkeland currents which the electric model holds is the source of the power of our sun. Remember the only other place we see this phenomenon in the laboratory is when we have a body like the sun at a focal anode of matter in an electric field. This is how we make arch lights or plasma. Given the model of matter with massive spaces and infinitesmal ""solids"", massive relative electrical load differentials can exist between points in space without any local measurable effect. Maybe our sun could switch off for a few days too. The probability is just tiny, and perhaps it has happened in history of earth."

"Good video!  I would like to share a pet peeve of mine,  if I may.  My statements do not necessarily apply to the presenter in this video. The “Extraordinary “ quote by Sagan is often inappropriately misused, overused and a favorite of those people who only want to contain all of the universe in the box (a three dimensional object) of their own personal paradigm.  This quote  is some people’s fancy way of saying,  you have to prove to me your experiences and knowledge in a way that fits my perception of what is “real” — then I will  believe you.  Thinking/experiencing outside the box is, by its very definition “extraordinary “ because it would entail four or more dimensional thinking. We cannot use a three dimensional litmus tests on something that does not abide by three dimensional laws just as the out of the box experiencer can’t prove anything to anyone who clings to using three dimensional tools to judge the validity of  the experience.  As a result, Sagan’s quote can refer to a challenge to prove previously unknown experiences in the three dimensional realm — the box (or the cube of matter, as I like to call it 😉).  The problem with Sagan’s quote is he doesn’t define his use of the word “extraordinary “. What may seem extraordinary to one person may not be so to another... just a thought."

Things that can be made to be in a lab. things that can be repeated and is scalable.

Some beautiful computer generated visuals.
Alright just a little into this I have 2 possibilities and they are planets of varying size and orbits that have not an exactly parallel orbit but slightly askew that cross at different times or how about a solar system that has planets with varying sizes and orbits that are totally random in a 90 degree or 10 degree difference or anything from an extreme degree orbit from each other to a little varying orbit from the plane the star is being looked at that vary the times and length of when the star gets blocked???

"Lies and theoretical fantasy bullshit..  Especially if their theoretical distances they tell us these stars are is true..  In which , even if true there's no way our satalites will ever get there to verify the distance.. Because we have no way to actually measure the distance of those gargsntum distances they say. its basically just their theories based on math problems they themselves come up with to fit .. And math problems fitting to prove a distance without any physical measurements with our instruments here and there means nothing ..I could cut all their numbers in half and then my new numbers would fit perfectly just 50% less... Its ridiculous at best to believe any of their distances they say. Because if the distances are correct we will never ever be able to prove it... Our satalites wouldn't even get near one if them for .minimum couple hundred thousand years probably millions . plus not to mention , these liars have been caught lying and scamming us so .any times that nobody should be listening to them and we definitely shouldn't be funding these supposed space missions that anyone that investigates critically would see its a joke and most if not all of them are completely fake ...

It's better to simply say that assertions should be backed up by evidence, and let the peers and observers make the determination of what is extraordinary and what evidence is sufficient.  Science should simply report the findings and not get involved in the judgments."

"What a complete load of Tosh!!! These people are meant to be intelligent. They make up a theory without observable evidence and then make into fact. That's bad science just like the evolutionary theory. No observable evidence, yet they believe and push it as fact. There could be a million and one reasons why the light emitted from a star dips, but it hasn't got to be because of aliens!! There will be a perfectly logical reason for it, which they haven't discovered it yet. They are absolutely desperate to discover life elsewhere, yet it does not exist. Why should there be life elsewhere anyway. We are unique in an amazing creation, fallen, but still amazing."

"FULLY UNDERSTANDING E=MC2 AND F=MA:

E=mc2 is DIRECTLY AND FUNDAMENTALLY DERIVED FROM F=ma. ""Mass""/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. This is PROVEN by BOTH F=ma AND E=mc2. Gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. GRAVITATIONAL FORCE/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/as) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. It ALL makes perfect sense. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Time dilation ALSO proves that GRAVITY IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY. THINK about it.

ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS CLEARLY GRAVITY.

ALL of SPACE is NECESSARILY ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL (IN BALANCE), AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent WITH/AS what is BALANCED ELECTROMAGNETIC/GRAVITATIONAL FORCE/ENERGY, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY.

Indeed, A PHOTON may be placed at the center of THE SUN (as A POINT, of course); as the reduction of SPACE is offset by (or BALANCED with) the SPEED OF LIGHT; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. PERFECT. It is proven. F=ma AND E=mc2 PROVE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/ENERGY IS GRAVITY. Great.

"I hate that statement and I think it´s a very bad way of thinknig. ""Extraordinary claims requires extraordinary evidence???"" WHY? Why do we need extraordinary evidence just because most people don´t want to or can´t change their views! Because of religion or dogmatic views of life or science. Evidence is evidence and should allways be accepted with the same value of proof what ever the claim is! Why would we need more evidence because it´s hard to belive?? What kind of science is that?????"
"What on earth is wrong with these people? So chuffed with themselves, praising each other as the zenith of human sentience."
more questions and confusion never any answers just assumptions... because just observing something is not science. and you will never know what you can not understand.
"The orbits of the planet's are in line with the farthest plane of the star so it will be moving closer to us and on the plane so the planetary body stays from our view in front of the star light so if you hold out a flash light and you are looking at something coming in front off the light but it's not moving to fast  left to right but closer to the Observer and so the light is being blocked out more but when it reaches the furthest point from the stars pull of gravity it starts go back inwards and away so you have to be at the exact point viewing and as everything is moving in space it may have been the  precise elliptic view  to get  multiple objects as they made their orbits Just a guess could be totally wrong with many points of astrophysics and planetary dynamics it's easy picture in my mind but don't know if the exact same waveform of light pattern is consistent I guess it would have to be exactly were the planet quits going away and starts getting closer? I may be missing so much in that guess , I'm no scientist"
My opinion: There are volcanic eruptions in the giant planet and the gigantic ash eruptions caused such asynchronous fluctuations of light intensity emaniting from the star

When asked to locate the star it was from, it went out and looked into the night sky, but it could not locate the star. Later on, they find out that a dyson sphere was built around it, blocking all light from it, which explained why the robot couldn't find it. Maybe the book was Journey to the Stars?

Another simple solution is small debris passing in front of Kepler having nothing to do with the star they are observing
The simplest solution is usually correct. A star with multiple large planets some of which have large moons can easily describe the light dip curves.
"I often ponder the possibility that as we are looking at light that was emitted thousands of light years ago, every star in the sky may no longer exist, and that we are completely alone. There is no point in planning to travel to any of these stars, as not only may they no longer be there, they may vanish whilst en route. The chances of any of the stars and planets still existing must be pretty slim. All signals, pulses etc are so ancient that it is beyond our comprehension, the source has long since ceased to exist. Or am I missing something??"

Would a planet with a moon bigger than ours, or even two or three planets aligned in orbit at that precise moment not give the asemetric results also the blocking of so much light? This event would appear random to us observing such a small segment of time?
Simples. Sorted and I have saw dust for braibs. Next! Haha...."

it's an alien 👽 dyson sphere ☀️
"Surely the aysemmetrc data is simply down to orbiting planets with their own orbiting moons. No different to an observer elsewhere seeing our sun with an aysemmetrc dip caused by the Earth. Then half way on the dip the moon comes from behind the Earth to block out more light giving asymmetry on the dip. No idea, I'm not a science person but that would explain the data."
You detected a rogue black hole flying through a solar system.  congrats.
That's no moon. It's a space station.

The fluctuation is bc whatever it is... its getting closer to us...
What a big nothing burger.  That's 13minutes I won't get back
Did anyone consider that it could be a black hole that appeared between us and the star? Wouldn’t it suck up the light and they don’t move either right?

"I think I may have an answer to this problem.

Imagine a system with three or four Jupiter sized planets. During their orbits there will be times when they align and as a result, the outermost will be over time, pulled inward toward its star.

The orbit of this outermost Jupiter becomes increasingly elliptical and in the process, it disturbs the orbits of the other Jupiters.

Eventually the orbit of the outermost Jupiter becomes highly elliptical where it plunges towards its star, passing very close, then speeds away. If the angle of its ellipse is just right from the view point of the Earth, we see the planet plunging toward its star followed by it speeding away behind its star. This orbit would match up with the long, slow period where the light from the sun is being slowly dimmed as the Jupiter plunges toward its star. At maximum star dimness, this Jupiter may be within the equivalent orbit of Mercury, which would explain the 20% drop in light. It then speeds away from its star, passing behind it from Earth's point of view, which results in the sudden increase in luminosity.

As far as the double dip in the data, followed by another dip, that can be explained by the outermost Jupiter towing the inner Jupiters into highly elliptical orbits, so that the closest passing Jupiter is rapidly preceded or followed by a second one, then more slowly followed by a third.

We should be able to prove this hypothesis via super computer, or by continued observation of the star when this behaviour begins to repeat. We could also see a very pronounced wobble produced by the gravitational tug of the planets as they speed by in their elliptical orbit."
"*removes bugs from telescopic lens* ""oh, there's the light again."""
Could a black hole be a possibility? That could account for the sudden changes in light.
"7 billions people, half of which starving, a collapsed economy, an overused world, but hey, let's use our resources to find planets that pass by stars on the other side of the galaxy for no reasons at all and no use at all.

You must be joking.  Stop watching Star Wars and do your work.
The unusual curve in the light is possibly due to an undetected black hole
It is for sure that none of us will ever have to deal with whatever they are seeing.

I'm thrilled you gave this Ted talk. I've participated in various Zooniverse research efforts since my time in college Astronomy class. I hadn't heard any follow ups until this. Awesome. Thanks.
They dug whole mountain ... And they didn't even find a mouse ... Wow ... Useless ....  😂😂
"And this, people, is where your tax dollars are going. Ridiculously outlandish speculation with nearly zero proof and no relevance to anything except science fiction fantasy. Wouldn't you just love to sit around, stare at data and say, ""well, it might be this and it might be that"" and never have to answer to anyone...and get paid?"
"Ok, so, I know they've had to consider this, but how can you tell, by measuring the dimming of the star, that the object is truly that size and not just closer to us, therefore blocking out more of the star's light? Yeah, i get that if it's in orbit then it can only be so far away, but, from what she says here I haven't seen that the pattern of flux has repeated itself proving that it IS in orbit... Or is that the first thing you check for before even mentioning it? That it repeats? Yeah...that must be it... Ok, never mind, I'm stumped. heh."
The data *was good.
Something is crawling around on the camera.
I guess everybody can give a Ted talk these days...
"You see, that's the limit for us. our reality is so much based on light.. we assume that light is the limit of the whole universe.. here we can argue if there is something else which can break the light barrier in terms of speed fo eg. wouldn't that be interesting.. our knowledge of the universe is still in its initial stage. its been just 2 centuries since modern physics took over.. we have so much to learn and hopefully we break this speed limit in the future."

"A more rational explanation is that the star itself is acting in an unusual manner, and its light output is erratic."
If a moon collided with a planet then a lot of dust would arise
"Why do all planets rotate around any star horizontally to our eye sight , we are never shown, told ever that a planet is rotating around a star vertically to our eye sight. Similarly about the moons of planets , why are they always shown and told rotating their corresponding mother planet horizontally to our eye sight. SOMETHING is strange there untold or FAKED. Its a free space and gravity could work for ONCE at least vertically to our eye sight."
What if that star has a planet that is donut shaped and revolving around the star.
"A computer by and of itself isn't capable of detecting or understanding anything. I'm frankly tired of people seeing a piece of silicon as anything else. In our hands, computers have guided us to the moon and back, they have been invaluable in fighting contamination and natural disasters, running simulations and broad scientific experiments. But without us telling that silicon what it must do, and in this case, what it must look for. It is nothing but a piece of silicon. Any comparison between man and machine is therefore utterly pointless."
she looks like the girl who got weird bangs in the vines when she said WTF

Only explanation- it's not a star...
To me it looks like a Solar System. You have a planet blocking out the light. What if two planets are lined up or on the same side? Then three or four etc... Maybe a Solar System that puts ours to shame in size? That would explain the different patterns of light being blocked. Especially if you have more planets in view. Just my opinion/imagination. :)

"Among the astrophysics community, it's become common knowledge that rouge planets are likely (far) more numerous than those bound to their parent stars.
They are completely random in their trajectories and in their velocities.
Some may be Jupiter sized or larger -- some may be rocky giants.
So, with these wandering bodies randomly traversing the interstellar medium by the millions/billions, doesn't it stand to reason that one (or the scattered remnants of a planetary collision) could cross the sight line between the Earth and any given star?
Think of colliding brown dwarfs or any number of possible collisions and their aftermaths.
And if the light-blocking planet/debris field were vastly closer to the Earth than KIC 8462852 when the observation was made/recorded, wouldn't the object(s) appear disproportionately huge?
On the feasibility scale, nearly any hypothesis involving natural processes is more realistic than an alien mega-structure of the size proposed."
"Could it be possible that these objects which are roughly 2 thousand light years away are colonizing fleets of humans leaving their original homeworld after exhausting their resources almost 1,740 years ago?"
"I really love what she ended on. 
""What will it mean if we find another star like this? And what will it mean if we don't?"" 
If we don't find anything like this again it could possibly rule out natural phenomena, 
and lean towards a more alien hypothesis."
My money is on that it is a pair of cloned binaries and we are located on its oscillating disk plane. The light dips are the semi eclipses that are happening with the binaries orbits. A perfect eclipse would be a 50% drop in light. Adding in a few planets orbiting its disk plane and those are the small dips in light output. Mystery solved.

Star trek tng has an episode of a dyson sphere.
But im king kong
They are rationalizing that a solar system with a kuiper belt would be parallel/linear/stable from our view.  Our viewing angle can simply not be parallel.  Remember that we only see solar system where planet pass in front of the star to our perspective.  We miss many of the ones that do not especially if the rotations are slow.  There is a lot missing here.
We so far behind! Y not just put a mega satellite on the moon or titan?
"I'm only seven min in, but it's pretty clear to me that it was a gigant spaceship blocking the light. I'm sure there are dussins of other ways to explain it, but thats the most logical reason. Right? 👽"
Blue super large giants not the right term i know but you get the picture there is so many of them formed out of gases and
you had better pray that we don't find aliens they will squas us like bugs
Okay so based on light being observed from Earth I'm guessing the fluctuations of the light being studied are broken up masses of energy flying throughout space. The star I'm sure is gone and been gone. I hope our taxes don't fund this research...
So what's up with the SETI data? Did the proposal find anything?

"I wonder if it could be something traveling away from the star and towards Kepler, guided by radiation ejected from said star?"
Wouldn't it just be an asteroid belt since the density changes?
"Where do they come up with these ""exact figures"" as to the size of and distance from Earth of these celestial objects.  It is ludicrous that people believe these ""facts and figures.""  There's no possible way to know for certain these sizes and distances from earth.  It's all made up, mumbo-jumbo.  Take a look at amateur photos and videos of stars and planets and you'll see that they're nothing more than pulsating lights, nothing more, nothing less.  These people have no clue as to what wandering stars and fixed stars ACTUALLY are."
"Well, 2019 aupdate: it was possibly just dust."

There is no spoon.
A small black hole between us and the star
"Sounds to me like you just have 2 planets or more which crossed in front of the  star at the same time but traveling at different speeds. This star could have dozens of planets and each time one crosses, another could come into the area also. you would never have the same outcome and it would look random."
"DISCLAIMER: Not a scientist, haven’t read the prior comments. 

Can’t the gravity of other objects influence the brightness of captured light as it bends those waves away from the Kepler lens?

Specifically, could a body orbiting this star be so massive that it causes those variances in expected results as our observations reach peak dimness (but yet not be dense/massive enough to be a star)? Think of waves along a water surface as a boat lumbers forward. Would an object’s gravity have that sort of perturbation on rays of passing light?

Just curious... this is awesome stuff!"
Alien Superstructures.

"6:05   ""The data were good"""
IMORTANT QUESTION:  How would we find planets orbiting stars NOT in our plane of sight? This is all about dimness of stars but what about all the stars who's orbit plane is NOT lined up with Earth's?
This is just one star. Imagine how many others out there could be just as interesting. I'm thinking they are going to pour every available resource at this one now and neglect looking for others anywhere else. Hopefully the Citizen Scientists will keep looking elsewhere.
and you say creationism is crazy?
I'd like to know why the program was so rubbish it couldn't recognise dips in a graph.
"Is this data a one time event, repeated every year or a certain time frame, not really explained anything. but i guess this story might get more funding"
"OFCOL, it's a planet with a moon system, possibly rings perhaps. that accounts for the asymmetry in the dip. (yawn!)."
science is a religion. Wake up!
"Bullshit. space is fake, the earth is flat. so many zombies are listening with closed eyes"
Why can it not be multiple planets crossing over at the same time?
This idiot will weep when alien civilizations arrive
This observation is not in real time. It occurred millions of years ago and were now seeing what it was like in the past. Could of been the formation of a new solar system. That was never mentioned.
"""The data were good""


............wth..........."
just dont like the way she starts
Exotic speculative science... or “we have no idea what we’re talking about so we will make stuff up”
"How do you know how potential advanced technology is going to work? How do you know if they have materials that can dissipate heat or not? Your projecting your human knowledge on a possible much more technologically advanced society. In order to find advanced life you HAVE to think outside the box, because we are primitive compared to them."
"you remember the guy who invented the car with a water motor? the guy almoast got arrested because we discovered zero point energy, he spent 2 days at the pentagon being harassed and questioned, in the end he was theatened and his research burned."
"natural explanation? you are talking about outside Earth, so it would be more than natural to find aliens, now there are several explanations for this manner but excluding extraterrestrial activity will only make you stupidier, matematically we are nott alone in our galaxy, i enfatize, galaxy, because th probability of being alone in the universe is 0% and the probability of being alone in a galaxy is 20%, so it means that there is 80% probability we are not alone in our galaxy, also we have seen aliens several times and made first contact and even had a big welcome when we went to the moon, why do people laugh when someone speaks of aliens? are they paid to laugh everytime someone says the world alien or ET? are people that stupid? People wake up, start to look for global piece so we have the opportunity to enter the galactic federation, we need to destroy the capitalism controlling our minds, we are more evolved technologicaly then spiritualy, because of that we are not allowed to use our technology to a fully extent, wouldnt u like to fly or teleport? just behave people, we have had that technology for more than 50 years but we are too dangerous to use it, evolve, the future is coming."
"Poppycock. And they put a woman up to explain it, because a man would be laughed off the stage."
who finds intelligent life on Earth ?
nice spitch for the next religion
"Maybe it was a set of planets and moons forming a phenomenon similar to moon eclipse in earth, only in a bigger scale, and because the moons/planets were not in a perfect line with the mother star, they looked like a square or whatever strange shape you think you saw."

"what a rubbish mythology... It could be some heavenly objects passing between earth and that star,and is very much closer to the earth. Its just like if we are capturing a light emitting huge ball at 100m distance and place a finger at 0.25m from camera. Surely the finger will look bigger and will diminish a large amount of light incoming..."
Dyson spheres are a conjecture hypothesis and do not exist.   To use it as an explanation for this data is pure fiction.   Also how is blowing up a planet a point for laughter .
"i love science, sad that most of humanity still believes in horsecrap"
Bill Nye the science guy said that we are in an enclosed system which we can´t leave from. Now my question would is how in the World did the Apollo missions get passed the Van allen radation belt?
"""Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter."" This sounded off to me, but she means by diameter not by volume, which is where most people's minds go to. By volume, Earth is actually 1300 times smaller."
Could it not just be a nebula or space gases passing between us and the star? There's a lot of distance between here and there. Plenty of space for clumps of matter to float past.

A fantastical astrological hypothesis .5% fact ...and 95% artistic licence !
"Another worthless TED video! There are hundreds of natural circumstances which explain this. (as some have alluded to below). These 'scientists' forget their math so easily.

"LOL.  Yeah right...it could be alien structures that surround the star....using more material than the physical planet could even provide to build.  yawn.  You can't describe your data because it isn't like your other data...so aliens did it.  lol.  

This is science fiction, not science.  The only true part of the entire presentation is that they don't know, they have no clue, and never will.   What a fun, fictional way to bring up aliens with no proof of aliens.   yawn.  The only other surprising thing is that it wasn't blamed on some random meteor impact (which seems to be the go to fictional explanation for many things that 'we don't know' and 'can't explain'.   

did they ever rule out device malfunction?  there isn't even any conclusive evidence that these light anomalies around any light in the sky (that we call 'stars' that are supposedly just like the sun) are indeed planets.  this is all Buck Rogers fantasy."
Why didn't you go to kmart and pay $5 to buy a nice shirt for this prgram?
"""1,000 times the area of Earth"" seems like a bizarre comparison metric, why not just mass?"
"What if is just a huge planet with huge moons,  so as they pass by in front of the star we will see an irregular pattern like that on the graphic"
"What is really mind blowing is that i just wasted 13 mins and 47 seconds watching this pseudo science babble...it is how the masses are being indoctrinated into the Alien narrative. Its also interesting how the scientific elite contradict themselves with something like this that stated that human beings could process and analyse large quantities of Data better than a computer...so much for all their hype about AI, which for the most  part is really just a sophisticated hoax, such as Sophia the robot that they try to convince the world is thinking for itself...."
"Two dumb questions from a biologist long interested in space science. 1. Could the phenomenon possibly be caused by objects smaller and closer to home, perhaps the path of a disintegrated but distant comet in our own solar system, or objects in our Oort cloud passing in front of the lens at a great distance. 2. Why don't we ever see Doppler shift data for this star? Many exoplanets discovered early on were found by planets causing shifts in their star's spectra rather than measuring luminosity dips from transiting planets so... why aren't we checking that out? Having both Doppler and transit data is the best case scenario for setting bounds on the volume, orbit time and orbit angle. It's a win-win."
I am the most mysterious star in all the universes😆
Aliens
There is billions of pieces of material surrounding our earth. Hmmmmm
Worst talk ever...
These so called 'scientists' don't even know who lives next to them and they are 'surprised' that they don't know what is happening 1480 light years away ..hmm ..
Oh yeah!!!!! “Dyson spheres” I’ve herd of these...imagine the Power... apparently it would take most of the material in a solar to construct one ...lets see if it dims in time. If it does. It would be fair to suggest that they are already aware of our viable atmosphere and our possible existence...this weed is really strong.. Nar that’s bollocks isn’t it we are looking backwards in time when we look up they are probably already extinct. They would have sent out seeding missions 4.5 billion years ago... I want my mummy

"The problem with a dyson sphere is the collection of materials needed to create such a creation. I    speculate that many planets would have to be absorbed for their resources in order for the making for such a device which wouldn't be practical on any level. 
Those blips could be interstellar gas clouds that absorb light. They could be slow moving variously sized pockets . Which could explain the diferent durations of light blockage. What would be interesting to know is if there were any disturbances on this stars surface. Who knows....maybe this particular star emits something unlike anything we've come across in space. Maybe a dark matter star."
soooo we're actually talking about aliens and proofs of their existence huh ..how far did I jumped into the future

"I understand the theory behind a ""Dyson Sphere"", but where would they get enough material to build it?  If I want to make a metal sheet I have to mine it then form it into the sheet and a planet only has so much material."
"Pitty that I don't have a telescope to observate. As long as we can observate only the light differences we cannot say if this phenomenon is just a huge planet having an elliptic course (even not stable caused by multigravity effect, like other huge planets or neaby stars) in a far distance of the star. If we could count the electromagnetic and gravity forshes we could proove something like that.Or simplify this theory i could say that this star has several huge planets or gas giants orbiting sized about 5 up to 30% of the star"
who wrote the fucking code at the first place？ miss this so obvious drop on intensity？ Is the scientist retarded or what， i mean， come on.
Just  to say most in universe indicate ignorance of speaker. because we don't know the whole universe. how can we say what is most or best or highest or lowest?
I think it was the collision of two large planets that the big dip was them both blocking the light and then colliding then the next weird data was the debris circling the star.
"Obvious guy: if it’s that far away and they’re using the assumption that light blocking the star implies planets or things immediately in front of the star, what if these anomalies are being caused by some other objects much closer to earth and still in between the path of light between earth and the star? That would also explain the apparently large size.  You can use your finger to block all the light from the sun but that doesn’t mean your finger is bigger than the sun lol..."

Watching this was a complete waste of time.
All they are measuring is the radiation from the star. They have been interpreting a variation in that as something passing between the star and us. But why? Why may it not be the star's brightness itself fluctuating?
Sounds like a brown dwarf binary with its own system orbiting its primary.
truly impressed blessings to you
I think there is no aliens I believe in God our Father
This reminds me of Qusars .nwhen they were first found people claimed they were built by aliens. Then we found others and then many other and realised they were stars that travelled round each other. We may have A qusar and dark matter. Where the matter is enough to change the view of the star but only for periods of time. and then the star is bright again. No aliens or stellar engineers but practical   ideas  about  stars and matter..
Nonsense. no explanation.
it feels so weird to watch this when you are an alien.

What if it’s a simese star?
"Among the possible explanations for the unusual light curve she did not make this one: An occulating object does not need to be very large if it much closer to the observer than the distant object (this star in question). And since there are ""out there"" rogue planets (which would be dark and possibly traveling in space with other rogue planets) that would happen to be between us and this star (not to mention dark galactic dust clouds of varying sizes) and it they were a thousand times closer to us than that star, it would not be beyond belief to see how that might create this unusual light curve that has not show a repeating and predictable quality."
can't it just be something closer than that star system getting in the way such as a planet or comet from another star appearing larger because it is closer?
We are all ready here.....................
Pretty unprofessional
Couldn't it be a solar system?
What is so hard to understand? That star has multiple planets like our solar system and they all crossed the path at roughly the same time. That is why the previous dips where all different intensities. They were different planets. I see no mystery at all.
Horse apples
"I could possibly be a much less outlandish, imaginative explanation such as two rocky planets that collided"
"This whole presentation ASSUMES that there are no other objects between that star and the telescope with which is been observed. If that star is a few light years away, then it is quite possible that in the pathway of its light there can be God-only-knows how many other opaque objects that could explain the phenomenon. These objects may well be passing just once, or periodically. What if the period of these objects is years, decades, centuries, or millennia, etc.? There are simply WAAAAAY TOOOO MANY POSSIBLE VARIABLES that could be involved in these observations. I'm amazed by the CERTAINTY with which this person talks about the whole event. Not to mention that what we are seeing is what happened as long ago as the star light/years distance is. So, the real question is why and how all of this justifies spending taxpayer's money??"
It's just an irregular pulsing pulsar.
"So very interesting, but she's not especially well spoken in this video. I think she was just flustered. Grammatical errors from astrophysicists are rare.

"It was great fun watching this. Perhaps we have found Nibiru?  Or we have found the Biblical place called 'Heaven' or 'the Heavenly Jerusalem?'  Or if you are not a believer, perhaps we have found Atlantis?  

More serious now: We humans are incapable of making sound theories about Astronomical features. The stupidity of wrong guessing being forgotten is so clear that sometimes I wonder wether Astronomers are not more than Astrologers and people believing in the supernatural. I find it interesting to see the evidence, but I don't have a clue what it is, so I say: ""I simply don't know'.  In a few hundred years from now our great great grandchildren may have found the solution and laugh at all our stupidity. It won't matter, we will be dead by then. Only, if there is life after death I may want to travel there to see what is going on out there. Time and space won't limit me anymore. So, the best bet to know what is going on there 1480 light years away, may be just going there and have a look myself. After all, the star of Bethlehem fortold the coming of Yeshua (Jezus) with the most famous star in history. But alas, most people don't take Yeshua very serious, especially theorethical astronomers. They will never know, but perhaps I will. I can wait 1480 years, as I will have eternal life."

"9 days of military global spending could feed all the world for an entire year. How much exploration, how much progress could be achieved for the WHOLE of our species if we invested a little more into things to unite   instead of more tools and weapons to kill one another... Just a thought"
Multiple planets and you are looking at a two dimensional readout for a four dimensional object tumbling through space.  The alien opinion is retarded.
"If the aliens built these massive solar panels.... why didn't they just move to a more habitable area and utilize the resources there? Secondly, what if this star just so happens to have 200 plus planets and we are watching solar alignments and the planets are possibly colliding due to gravity. Maybe we just got lucky and witnessed the first set of planets dissolve in a crowded solar system?"
Oh c'mon.  This universe is just a trash dump from a higher level of consciousness.
How about a number of planets with moons of their own in orbit around this star. Some closer to it than others. This could give reason for the uneven dip and on a regular cycle. The others could be moons as mentioned and or other planets that all haven’t transversed the sun yet. This all could add up to a lack of data as of yet.

"The ""Giant Impact Hypothesis"" that theoretically happened to Earth ~4.5 billion years ago is accepted as a logical idea. Couldn't something like this happen within another solar system outside of ours and possibly explain the chaotic dimming that seems to be occurring?"

"We should look for intelligent life on Earth, self destructing can’t be intelligent."
"Why are people so happy about finding alien societies in space, on earth every time a more advance meet a lesser advance they destroy it."
"If thats the aliens's situation, where they had to tear their own planet apart and now living on metal, we have no business approaching them. It would be our greatest mistake. They didnt had the will to stop the dmg on  their planet and all of them are most likely sicken tired of sitting on metal. It would only take a few rebels that disobeyed their governments orders and take control of this planet. For their own delight. They wont bother to sit and negotiate, when they can easily demand. Its like humanity has been doing with forests,  which is vast of different races and communities, yet, since they are inferior to us, we take their land and make the best of it,... for us, not them. They are always misplaced and destroyed in the process."
We need to find intelligent life on this planet.
"There is one or more alien spacecraft relatively close to our solar system, just ducking in and out of the way of our view of this star at unusual intervals.  That is the only plausible explanation that fits the data.  As to their motive, it's mainly just to mess with us.   I imagine they are monitoring us and having a big laugh over how perplexed we are.  Of course they might be inebriated.   If they can master interstellar travel, making martinis in zero gravity would be a piece of cake.  Drunk aliens can be so annoying."

Therefore we need more individuals investing their life in developing the tools we need in order to learn.  I would donate my life to making the vast depths of the cosmo's more accessible.  Sounds way more exiting than my current job. This girl spoke with extreme rationality. ;p"
"Well, could it be something in our own solar system that happened to travel past the line of sight and blocked that star? Have you thought of that? That could explain the huge dip of the star light."
Neat... but dull.
"Does it have to be just one planet orbiting the star? What if several planets are transiting at about the same time, but not exactly the same time? That could account for asymmetric dimming."
"Comets are no explanation. They would have to be gigantic to produce any noticeable effect. Or absurdly a lot: a million Halley comets give a shadow similar to Earth (ie, undetectable). Billions of comets would have to fly there.
I have another explanation. Maybe we can see two distant stars, which just happened to be perfectly aligned in one line? Around the stars can be planetary systems that cause slight deviations of star positions. These are irregular movements. The stars can thus obscure one another, causing a temporary decrease in brightness."
There is proof of life in space weather its biological or robotic drone type.Look at the images where astronomers and amature astronomers with back yard telescopes taking videos of huge objects near the sun as though they are obtaining plasma or something.All of the real actual video footage and pilots who lose their jobs if they talk of these sightings.Its not made big because the governments keep us in  suspense and feed us CGI garbage for all the fake NASA footage aboard the ISS and make big news of this.Its to control the sheeple and make us believe in something else.Its already out their folks and its smart to stay away from so called humans because the end result with us is always self destruction and greed.

"""Alien hypotheses should be a last resort."" But they ARE a resort, even if last. Why then, is the hypothesis that there is an intelligent creator behind what is seen not even a LAST resort? Just asking.
And, it would be nice if science would just say, ""We don't know. It's a mystery."" When they can't figure something out, instead of creating fictional explanations. Leave those for the writers of science fiction."
Anything Nada related can't be trusted information.

"It's obviously a flying saucer mother-ship hyper-spacing from KIC 8462852 here, as it gradually get closer, it blocks more of it's home world sun light, then when it finally changes it's trajectory to enter into earth orbit, KIC 8462852's brightness is quickly restored. The profile of the sun's energy drop only makes sense only when you consider the mothership is travelling faster than the speed of light."

Large planet... multiple moons that inline.. but when they don't.. they show more then one ligjt blocking trends
"What could this be? A planet 15 times bigger than Jupiter, not spherical or round,  transiting the star for a week, then disappearing for years. We know that planets form spheres or circles, they don't form rectangles. The most likely thing I can thought of is some sort of Type II civilization-a stellar civilisation harnessing all the energy, or a lot of its parent star using a  Dyson sphere-I thought this 5 minutes into the video. Perhaps the Dyson Sphere operates on a timer, so they only need energy every few years, so it saps up the star's energy, then goes dormant. This could explain why it is transiting for a week, that is the Dyson Sphere on a really slow orbit of its star."
"Scientist C , then   ....Smashes Head Into Table."
"Would have been cool but when the star was observed with a dedicated privately funded project they found that the star's itself was subject to "" internal convulsion""  (meaning it dimmed and brightened on its own) and also did have a think layer of dust helping to block the light. Great observation either way.

"Im no scientist but if someone was building a dyson sphere around that star, it would take a unfathomable amount of material and mass to build (like converting a 1000 or more planets to be broken down into raw materials). Wouldn't that cause such a large gravitational pull it would be noticed in the surrounding stars."

I've come to the conclusion that, they're intentionally trying to get laughs out of their audiences, because they're able to get me laughing every time, now that couldn't be unintentional, could it?
I'm continually astonished by the way these 2 groups of ""scientists"" are able to take nothing more than opinion & theory &, generate so much humour. 
Notice also the staunch severity in the way they explain their opinion & theory, ohh, that just gets me every time. 
Well, keep up the good work Tabetha.

Check your opinions, beliefs, emotions at the door, and just observe what is being shown. Say 'I don't know,' because you, I, we, most likely don't."
"From Wikipedia, '...however, further analysis based on data till the end of 2017 showed wavelength-dependent dimming consistent with dust but not an opaque object such as an alien megastructure which would block all wavelengths of light equally.""   So, their basic assumption that it would take a solid object to cause such dimming was wrong.

When it was first announced, we thought it was ludicrous that ""scientists"" would jump to a conclusion of aliens with a Dyson swarm."
"Seems to be a case of desperately wanting to believe in aliens. I believe science will say the odds of a single molecule being formed by random chance is something less than one out of all the particles in the entire universe, yet molecules are constantly being formed. Seems to me that one might have to believe that life simply cannot exist due to random chance, without believing in beating astronomically bad odds. Believing something is directing life is far less of a stretch than believing it happens randomly."

If they were pure ice no heat would be seen"
"The first question I would ask is; has your scope *actually* observed a transit, or are you deducing a transit simply from the light dip? If the latter, then the irregular dips may be the result of something other than the transit of a humongous planet. Perhaps something about the star’s visible light output itself is causing an irregular dip in the light curve. The next thing I might suggest is that perhaps this is a binary star whose partner is a dead or neutron star which is not emitting any of its own light, and whose orbit is not regular...or even a binary partner which itself has a dead partner or planet orbiting it, and depending upon the relative positions of the two dead bodies as they transit, the light curve will vary almost unpredictably. Consider that the size of the dip can be caused by a huge object transiting close to the star, *or* a smaller object orbiting much farther away from the star. But then, I’m a creative director/artist...what do I know ; )"
AND! If it was a Dyson Sphere the dips would be symmetrical. Or have a pattern on a cycle.
"We're absorbing energy from our host star, that was 1,480 years ago it already doesn't exist anymore, guess who's star is next h00mons??"
"Wait a second. Couldn't those weird dips be from an asteroid belt? Or asteroid belts? That would explain the asymmetry. Also, the graph she is using only depicts duration of dimness, but couldn't an asteroid belt be extremely wide? Meaning, several asteroids could be in the way causing the dip in light, and she is reading the data as it being big and asymmetric, when an asteroid belt could explain all this phenomena."
"Don't freak out, it's just multiple alien structures 1,000x bigger than our planet. It's cool...."
If an Alien race was so advanced to harness the energy of their sun via a building a mega structure around its star or part of it to capture more of its energy they would likely have the intelligence and developed the science to create their energy needs via fusion which we on earth have been trying to develop the past 30+ years and may well have figured out finally within the next 30 years or so ourselves.
"I'm betting it's natural but something we just don't understand yet. Aliens? Well, this is just my opinion but I think it's a possibility that intelligent life is an anomaly."
"Tell me why no-one seems to have contemplated the entire possibility of an alien ship which is significantly intermediate in distance between us and the star? That would certainly explain the transient light reduction(s) from an otherwise nominally shining star, and the complete absence of any heat emissions - indeed, certainly any evident ones. It is furthermore, VASTLY more likely, than some ABSURD notion of a ""megastructure"". Speaking of not defying the laws of physics, have these astronomers ever walked across the academic aisle, and asked the engineers for their comment(s) on (a) the entire subject matter of ""Absorbing energy"" out of something like that, (b) the RIDICULOUS NIGHTMARE of attempting to build it, and (c) doing that, when you are presumably ""out of energy""(???Meaning What, exactly???) to start with? Surely, if we recognize the entire possibility of extraterrestrial life, we could probably make the giant intellectual leap, to recognizing the possibility that they are in a spaceship (however advanced, by the way), that is simply somewhere in space, literally in the way of our line of sight with the given star!

"It seems to me, that what it is showing , is a planet with a like Saturn ring, a generally disc shaped, but probably the ring is very much not evenly distributed and when seen from the edge profile behaves more like a planet , but when seen face on it is more irregular on obstructing the star’s light towards observing field. Plus can be on an elliptical path around the star."

"This was recently tracked to a series of remarkably unlikely events that have been described as been miraculous. The cause of the blank data is that the various nerdy amateur and professional astronomers all managed to get lucky periodically (and miraculously at the same time every several months) and thus the lack of light from the star is because the nerds were seeing stars of their own, but not through their telescopes for once."

"If something large crashed INTO a star.....you'd see an uneven dip. The pre-collision curve would be fairly typical. The post-collision curve would non-typical.
The collision of a dead-system (dark star and it's satellites) could result in a few of the uneven dips, of various sizes, and themselves distributed unevenly.
Possibly, some of the cannibalized system would fall into a more-or-less stable orbits, resulting in new, but normal, dips in the future.
Said more-or-less stable orbits would settle into stable or non-stable orbits....so some non-normal dips could still be seen, but likely far fewer of them, long into the future."

"Walk with me for a moment- I'm not talking about this star now, and not talking about reasons for the blockage of the star's light- 
Just talking about the speaker's comment at about 0:39. There is no valid scientific reason to always put an alien hypotheses ""last"", per se. It completely depends on the evidence!

For example, let's say a craft descends out of the sky, and unearthly creatures get out and walk around. In that case, the alien hypothesis would NOT be the last resort to explain the phenomenon. It would be the FIRST hypothesis!
Right away, someone will scream ""yeah, but the blocking of the light from a distant star doesnt necessarily mean its aliens!"". True, but that is not what I'm discussing now, here. I'm referring to the scientific method of observation. The speaker simply stated that an alien hypothesis should ""always"" be the last resort when evaluating unexplained phenomena, and did NOT restrict this view to discussions of the star Tabetha B. 

Therefore, a mistake in logic has been made, to automatically rule out aliens in all cases, and only consider aliens as a last resort. 
That is not a scientific viewpoint. Make no presumptions either way. Examine the evidence, and see where it leads. Dont make your mind up in advance, because that is not in the spirit of scientific endeavors.
Ok, now back to your regularly scheduled program about how this light blockage isn't automatically aliens. (Well, duh..!)"
"I always felt uncomfortable with some of the findings from Kepler.   Super Earths and very close Jupiters.  The later in particular doesn't seem plausible.  I don't have alternative theories, but I don't like the Kepler conclusions for somethings.
In relation to this star in the video, is it possible it's just an interstellar patchy dark dust cloud passing between us and the star?  There are many large ""dark regions"" mapped this way, by looking at how they block light from stars behind, so why not the same thing on a smaller scale.  Instead of large ""dark regions"", much smaller clumpy dark patches."

"""we don't understand""  is  true.   In fact there are millions of things right here on earth that ""we don't understand"" .
Instead of creating a sensation amongst an IGNORANT public , let's work on some humility , let's spend our time trying to understand , without 
publicizing our failure."

"I had to pause and laugh at her opening statement. There is no reason for alien activity to be considered ""a last resort."" Every angelic being is by definition, an ""extraterrestrial."" Thees folks have always been with us, and they always well be. They are indeed, everywhere.

In the summation, it is essential to remember that aliens are as much a part of the nature of the cosmos as we are."

"This is amazingly, scary, only if it's not an erroneous fluke!  You know we're not alone, I know that we're not alone, the government knows that we're not alone.  The problem exist in whether society can accept that we're not alone--that is, whether society (in its evolutionary stagnation) can embrace and coexist with new forms of superiority."
"Look at something millions of light years away, then make something up then tell us with conviction (science)????"

"k here are some of the problems with dyson sphere's:
They would have to mine a ridicoulous amount of resources to build the sphere.
They would have to aquire a ridiculous amount of fuel to take it into space.
Think about it seriously we humans have lived circa 20000yrs, we fucked up the planet just to get to this point, imagine a planet that would have to exist maybe millions of years to get to dyson sphere producing levels, they would have to avoid all extiction level events by nature en selfmade (nuclear war / mishaps, food shortages, etc.)
They would face the same problems as us if they were to mine / colonize other planets (enviroment, distance, just luck to have nearby planets with resources)
(also dont give me the 'they can travel at lightspeed to get to planets with resources', cause that would again take insane amounts of fuel near unlimited')
Also just as a lay person, shouldn't data be reproducable to be accepted as 'scientific evidence' have we seen the same dips in other nearby stars they would be moving it too? can we send another satelite that sees the same dips around the star if it was debris? or just bear with me could it be the sensor fucked up? or the interpretation of the data is just wrong and ur looking at something completly different?"
This is at the level of a curious 8 year old boy.
"And the whole order of the stars shall be concealed from the sinners.
And the thoughts of those on the earth shall err concerning them
Yea,they shall err and take them to be gods
And evil shall be multiplied upon them

Only thing I can be sure of is that our planet remains the only nest we have for all our eggs.

everybody this real incident I believe it's my duty to mention it. April
 2016, I got up from my sleep rare to happen for some reason the case 
with me saw something that no one believe and I'm being an Arab from 
Qatar, but I say the right word what I saw on the ceiling of my room 
clearly and for a period just a few seconds, but I am 100% sure an Image
 of Jesus Christ feature as i remember the face shape just a little 
long, white close to an Arab or middle east Caucasian people the eyes 
beautiful the face beard is light and head hair lay almost on his 
shoulders a bit and the color of beard and head hair not much dark I 
think I hinted his hands back room was not dark in the beginning I 
thought he looks to some degree to one of my friends but inspiration 
jump to my mind he is the Christ and what I astonished of the image it 
is clarity .why me have this experience I do not know but did happen and
 this is the ultimate truth because it got with me accurately. . ( this 
is not my real name due to personal reasons) Since 2001 until now I see 
drawings / images /writing also creatures close to human and animals 
running also show events some of them occurred and others not I see 
writing Arabic and English as well as shapes , lines which is similar to
 old language all of these appear on the ceiling /wall .I saw clearly a 
shiny body in the form of a cigar up to a meter inside my room for 
seconds it was clear to the extent of my astonishment and how he entered
 the room? translation using google."

"no one knows anything about anything. i hope to one day be able to fully know and understand everything that is going on and have it presented to me in such a way as to not overwhelm me, but instead, to completely enlighten me so i would never have to worry about anything again"
"this is ridiculous!!! that only works if the planet is going around its star vertical to us, what if it is orbiting its star horizontal??? then it wouldnt be a dip in light to us....stupidity!!! Then it could be a tiny planet but in such a large orbital pattern that it blocks its whole huge star because its so far away......or another object in another orbit that crosses paths....could be a hundred options.....if this is the best they can do they are children"
Fake! Waste of tax dollars
"Another 14 minutes of life wasted. ""Most mysterious star in the UNIVERSE"" becomes,,,,,, boring speculation about something in one sector of the Galaxy, which could be virtually anything. Alien structures that are several times larger then the planet they came from? LOL"
"It's so simple to explain, that star is so powerful that it's uses most of it's energy fast.. and all the stuff we are detecting around it,it's just rocks and planets gliding and shuttering cuz of the sudden change of the gravitational force that once shaped and bond them"
Extrodinary poppycock
There's no way a computer can make mistakes - they're loaded by us. ><
Seems to me multiple planets in different obits could cause multiple dips as they cross each others obits and even maybe some moons are dimming light!
What about omicron seti?

"Maybe it's us, after we merged with A.I. to become Humanoids. In the same way dogs could never understand quantum physics, we wouldn't be able to understand how we, in the future as Humanoids, were able to manipulate the time-space continuum and create space structures in other galaxies."
what a boring speech.  Get an Astro physicist next time.  Not this hack
"What about objects in between our stars Tabetha? Such as the Oumuamua asteroid/comet from beyond? Or the recent rogue planet discovery? Would a mass of asteroids that were possibly heading in the direction of our sun, make similar fluctuations? And even block out more and more light as they got closer? Such as how a huge fleet of massive interplanetary ships traveling at sublight speed, loaded with frozen alien colonists coming to colonize Earth, would appear? HAHA, gotcha! 
But seriously. Interstellar objects coming in our direction? 
Although many times in OUR history native people have seen fleets of colonists coming closer and closer across the vastness of the ocean. But history never repeats itself right?!?!"
"A bit far fetched , why did she not mention a planet with a couple large moons, that was the first thing I thought of when I saw the odd light graphs, the moons might be orbiting at different speeds."
"Also, everyone digging on her... jeez, guys, she was making a joke with the ""space battles"" thing. And the ""extraordinary claims"" bit at the start was a disclaimer pointing out that we don't really have any good way to prove any of these hypotheses at the moment, so the wild ones are about as good as the mundane... but, it's more likely to be the mundane ones, so whilst it's nice to imagine that we've just discovered the Vulcans or whatever, further study will likely disprove it and show a more natural, believable cause. It's just that the media picked up the faecetious explanation of Why We Should Concentrate Our Research On This Star For A Little While, i.e. ""It could be aliens! (but it probably isn't)"", ignored the part in brackets, and ran with it, and she's here to explain what lies behind that little feeding frenzy."
"Regarding the ""swarm of comets"" hypothesis... I'm wondering if that's more likely than you would first think.

Consider just how congested we're coming to realise our own solar system is, with hundreds of thousands of objects swirling around in all sampled parts - that is, the inner system (just inside of Mercury to out beyond Mars), the already-known ""asteroid belt"" proper (most likely either the result of two planets that collided, or a protoplanet that never quite finished forming due to lack of mass - but leaving at least one identifiable Minor Planet behind in the form of Ceres), the outer system (just inside of Jupiter to roughly the orbit of Neptune), and then beyond through the Kuiper Belt (where Pluto, Eris, and their smaller Minor Planet siblings live, along with their moons, and countless smaller objects, out as far as Sedna), and maybe even the Oort Cloud (supposed origin of a lot of long-period comets) ... should it actually exist.

Although there has been some boost to the discovery rate made by radar-augmented astronomy (essentially, near-field radioastronomy using an active transmitter rather than simple passive reception), the majority of those objects have been discovered and tracked using a combination of the visible and infrared light they reflect from the sun - and therefore block from leaving the solar system - and their occlusions of brighter known stars and planets... essentially, full- or majority-width transits of the object of interest in front of another one whose motion is either much slower or effectively zero. Thus we see them both blocking light from other stars, and that of our own sun. And there's a lot of them. It's like grit swirling around the drain of a bathtub after an entire rugby team has washed off the mud of 80 rainy minutes' play in it, rather than a few lone balls of rock moseying their way around. Mass transit and occlusion is the norm, rather than a rare occurrence.

Now, the orbits of these objects, unlike the main planets, are at all kinds of inclinations relative to the sun, but the majority of them are within a certain limited range of angles from the main planetary plane. They also tend to form clusters and clumps, or have chains following the same general orbit, with particular object families being known, and especially there are relationships that fit the typical Lagrange point orientations, including clusters of asteroids that lead or follow the larger planets at their L3 and L4 points (L4 and L5? I keep forgetting).

It's already mentioned that the Kepler exoplanet search essentially relies on our being lucky enough to get a view of a star that just happens to be close enough to its main planetary orbital plane (like, probably within 1 degree, if not a whole lot less) that we get to see its planets transit in front of the stellar disc. What if, by some other sheer stroke of luck, and thanks to the great number of stars that are being observed, we were aligned nicely enough to catch a whole cluster of such minor planets, orbiting another star, interposing themselves between us and that star? And they were orbiting far enough out, like the outer reaches of our own Kuiper Belt or inner Oort Cloud (the transition point is a not inconsiderable fraction of a light-year), that their apparent motion vs the star was very slow, yet their size would also seem much larger, especially if it's not a particularly large star? The point made about planets not getting much larger than Jupiter is because once you exceed that by maybe 2x (which brings you to an area of maybe 400-500x Earth, but still not 1000x) the great mass of gas making up the planet gets compressed enough at the centre to start undergoing nuclear self-ignition... and then you've got yourself a small star.

Stick one of those at the centre of a system, and the components for another planet of almost the same size but not enough to selfignite, maybe composed of more solid elements but too widely distributed to form a single spherical mass (maybe down to some kind of other disruption), and you've got an irregular, clumpy cluster of material, a considerable fraction of the star's own size but looking larger due to being closer to us, orbiting it quite slowly due to the distance and the relatively weak gravity of the central element, and arrange it _just-so_ that we see it passing directly in front of the star rather than offset to either side (though, we haven't yet seen less than 85% of the normal light coming through, so it need not be entirely perfect), and you may well see the results we have here.

Next you'll be claiming that the 'odd' radio emissions from the 3rd rock in the Sol system are natural and not communications/transmissions from a sentient race.  Why is it SOOO hard for humans to accept that they are not the sole inhabitants of the universe?  God did not create the Earth for their sole benefit and they are not 'so' special as to be unique or cant the human ego cope with the concept that they're simply organic chemistry and probably quite common wherever there's water and heat in the 14Billion light years or so bubble we call the universe.
Its a partially constructed Dyson sphere.  Possibly still under construction by robots left be a dead race.
go read the threebody problem
"RIP Kepler, you will be missed"
Could'nt it just be another star in transit?
"Is there really something temporarily blocking the light? Can you see evidence of it when it moves into a position that would reflect the star light? What if instead the light that the star is emitting is fluctuating? A star is a complex chemical reaction, right? Involving source materials that are converted into other materials and are driven from one state to another and so on. Presumably there is a kind of consumption of some sort of finite resource that is happening as a star burns. What if this star is in the early stages of winking out?"
Maybe Amy Schumer walked in front of the telescope.
Interesting

"Great they found a planet so big orbiting a star, but what next, I mean they'll never go there to see it and nobody else will probably ever go there in the future either."

"I never understood the concept of a dyson sphere. These things have to be so freaking huge that you would need more material than all planets in a solar system combined. The reason is kinda simple. If you have a small star you would most likely have less material from the previous star which created all the heavy elements. If the star is huge (like Betelgeuse or something) you might have more mass in form of planets and asteroids (or not because maybe huge stars are like still generation 1) but at the same time the dyson sphere has to be significantly larger. I don't think that a structure like this would be beneficial at all. 
If a civilization travels to a near solar system for the only purpose to harvest its star then it would most likely be an intergalactic race which wouldn't be a good thing for us. I think its just some debris plus dense dust clouds from an astronomical event."
Holey tin hat batman i just waisted 15mn of my life ! I was intrested for the first 11 mn then she whent in left field an i think shes stuck. But i love her passion as well as the whole premise of observations
"One thing is, if the whole world was to cooperate on space we could actually achieve all of our dreams of going to Proxmi Centauri in like a decade than a whole millennia fighting over politics. Also, the star for my theory would be that it is a star with a black hole orbiting it. The star and the black hole are orbiting each other and every time the black hole is in front of our view it would of course have that asymmetrical shape because the black whole is sucking all the light slowly from a certain angle first then covering our view. Or it could be a lot of planets around that one star."

"Why would a computer not have picked up such huge dips on a graph?  I don't understand why it took humans looking at graphs to see this.
Also, is it possible to actually just rewind and ""look"" at the dot during these times?"
Have the dips re-occurred??  If so is this seen on a consistent/timely basis like other orbits?
"TED, the Milky Way is not ""the universe""."
"Dust in orbit around the star would radiate in IR. But, what about a dust stream passing by KIC 8462852 at sufficient distance  (not gravitationally bound to the star) to reduce temperature increase in the dust to an insignificant level? 

That could provide the significant dimming and irregularity consistent with observed data. If it was close to KIC 8462852 and of relatively small width, it could explain the lack of obscuring of other objects near the line of sight."
What if this star has 300 planets in it's orbit? What of the planets have hundreds of moons each? I know this is crazy but that could be another explanation.  In reality I hope it was Alderan being blown up and Lucas is actually from that solar system.
people who believe the universe came accidently are stupid
"That wasn't much of a revelation, kind of pedestrian actually.  I've come to expect more of TED. I hope this doesn't mean we're running out people that have something inspiring and interesting to say."
On second thought...let's not go to Earth.  It is a silly place.
"SIGH. Classic syntactic mistake, but I am surprised to hear it from a scientist. At 3:20, she says ""Earth is 11 times smaller"" - ONE times smaller than something is non-existence. I think she meant ""1/11th the size of..."" This is a very, very common mistake made by people like journalists, writers, etc. but a scientist should know better."
"Have you taken into account that that it could've been an asteroid much closer to the sensor than the star? Closer objects do appear larger... Also, the universe isn't static with the only planets orbiting stars. The stars orbit each other, more massive objects (such as black holes). the centers of galaxies, etc. So, an object orbiting another star (closer to the sensor) can give the illusion of being something ""else"" because it could move in the same direction as the star and, therefore, remain in an obstacle for longer. 

Black holes can also cause the anomalies, since black holes cannot be detected. Black holes also do not emit anything (including heat). There are many plausible explanations that do not include extraterrestrials. A brown dwarf could also be an explanation."
It's a shame that Marxists around the planet are busy siphoning off all the people's wealth to cultivate bloated tyrannical governments whose priority it is to silence dissent and to imprison and destroy those who do not toe the party line ... rather than to allow people of similar but independent interests explore as they would.
Enough objects (planets or Moons)  in line between Tabetha and Kepler makes sense to me. Nothing special about all this except for the fact that all this has cost us billions!

"What's really amazing is the furthest singular star ever found, it was found because an object with an immense gravitational field (hypothesized blackhole) magnified the light behind it, and the star happened to be there, it magnified it 2000x it's original light. The star is nicknamed Icarus and is a hundredfold further than any previous star discovered, 9 BILLION light years away, A SINGLE FUCKING STAR. It took me a while to really process this in even the slightest and my mind is blown."

Why is it when I do a time lapse of stars the line I get from each and every star is the exact same length be them close or far away as if they are all in the same distance away?

"Mythi.com explains-
Q - Mythi, what is causing the unusual dimming of light from the Star KIC 8462852? Is it a Megastructure built by an ancient race? If so, what race built it, for what purpose, and are they still alive today?
- Ro, that star does not have orbiting planets, it has been encapsulated for energy use. She is already encapsulated 1,300 years ago. But the question is relevant; I never explained this before to you friends. There are stars with soft burning in their reactions, and when there are no dependent planets of its light and heat in their field of gravitational influence, some cultures with many colonies and interplanetary operations as Camelopardalis manage the release of regional CG responsible to make such encapsulation with Krulians supervision, which is a high source of inexhaustible energy for the useful life of that orphan star. Many thousands of orphan’s stars have already been encapsulated in this way. But that was a technological step that has already been replaced by other sources of energy much less costly to implement."

This is very dangerous for humanity; but also holds our greatest opportunity."
"Or, it's just another solar system with lots of planets of various sizes. We have 8 or so planets in our own system, but why couldn't another solar system hundreds of light years away have, say, dozens and dozens of planets, whose various sizes produced the effects observed?"

I am not sure but asymmetrical brightness could also happen due to multi star system e.g. if a planet has multiple suns. Right?

"Humans are so dense , if there's one thing i've learned living amongst you the last 40 years is that you always think in the most inefficient of terms.
The energy it would take to create a dyson sphere would mean the civillization in question has already virtual unlimited sources of energy and would not be stupid enough to spend it on inefficient energy production such as a dyson sphere.

Very interesting...I'm not a scientist but my first thought is if it they asteroids or some sort of space matter...it is getting closer and increasing speed. Which is a possibility too. The closer it gets the faster it moves. Just saying.
There's no God... there are no aliens either...we are simply alone in this entire universe
So have our radio telescopes or set I observed it...if not why not if so can someone enlighten me please..
"How can we be so certain that its not aliens? How is it even possible that we are the only intelligent species, the law of probability does not work that way, the odds in favor of a civilization who had probably 250 Mn years can actually build this stricture.

Could it be a solar system orbiting a star? With maybe a collapsed star also in the orbit of the star along with some other objects?
all theorys.
They are observing the eddy-curves of space/time rippling from a black-hole collision.
"What about multiple planets in the same solar system crossing in front of the star at the same time as in a partial solar alignment? These planets would obviously have different orbits and therefore cross at varying speeds and angles off from solar or celestial equatorial plane thus potentially blocking out more light? This could also possibly explain the inconsistent reduction and then sudden increase of light creating an uneven transit. If someone was observing our own solar system in 2002, they could have seen a partial alignment of planet relative to our sun as well."
Frigging aliens you say? 😓
Thats no moon.... Its a space station.
I doubt that an Alien race would build a structure that size because they were running out of energy sources. It would take more raw material to build such a structure than there would be available in several solar systems. My theory/guess is it's a  machine that sustains a dying star so the alien race don't have to abandon their home world and look for a new place to live.
Which objects blocking this star light that object is in habitable zone can we calculate according to the star is it possible if possible and that object is in Habitable zone then its Advance civilisation is there..... I know lots of people have lots of theory's everything be clear when we lounch Jems web telescope this one help to get clear Image to Analysis...

"Perhaps it is a gas giant with an abnormally dense cluster of moons that are the size of smaller planets like ours. And at great distances the entire planet/moon cluster acts as one giant light blocker. The various sizes of the moons could explain the asymmetry. I feel like if we are considering ET, my explanation could be just as probable. What about a debris field that is in a straight line, but perpendicular from the origin star? Like the hand on a clock, with the center of a clock being the star around which the hand rotates? When it aligns with us, we are staring longways into this debris field? This could explain the asymmetry as well. Then again, I'm not sure if this formation is possible, as matter seems to approach ring formations in a gravitational field over time. Lastly, yes dyson spheres are an interesting concept but I think there is another ET explanation that is equally, if not more likely to be the case. Imagine in our distant future, we decide to alter Venus in an attempt to make it habitable. Venus is ever so slightly outside the habitable zone and it's possible it simply needs to just cool down for several hundred years maybe more, to begin stabilizing the atmosphere. We then build a very large heat shield that regulates or deflects a fraction of the heat being absorbed by Venus. This device would be big enough to mask some of the stars light in Kepler measurements, but not the size of a dyson sphere. What if the ET life orbiting the star in question did something like this? Just my thoughts."

"And if a few massive planets orbiting around a smaller star happened to be coming into ""view"" alignment around the same time we were looking would that not cause multiple drops in light??  Our own planets align from time to time and would cause multiple drops if they aligned after passing in front of our cameras.

Wiki - One calculation of alignments within around thirty degrees (about as close as they can get) shows that the last such alignment was in 561 BC, and the next will be in 2854. The eight planets plus Pluto are somewhat aligned every 500 years, and are grouped within 30 degrees every one to three alignments."

She rightly gives credit to amateur astronomers. Astronomy is one of the few sciences - possibly the only science - where professionals and amateurs are able to work together so closely. In fact, many amateur astronomers have equipment that is the envy of professionals.
Astronomy is a great programme for anyone to take up at an amateur level. Anyone wishing to try it will always find another amateur astronomer, or an astronomy club, willing to help. There is no pressure to achieve something - the new enthusiast can take the hobby as far as she or he wishes and many professional astronomers had their start as an amateur, looking at the night sky through someone else's telescope.
I have done time running public nights at a local observatory and the most rewarding visitors are the children, who go up the ladder to the eyepiece, not knowing what they are going to see, and come down with stars in their eyes. The questions they ask can tax any encyclopaedia and on more than one occasion I had to fall back on the emergency back-up answer: ""I don't know"".
I have an 8-inch Celestron that I set up on the patio on clear nights sometimes for my granddaughters. When the youngest was six, she looked through it for the first time at the Moon and said, ""It's like ground. It's got holes in it."""

"My understanding of a Dyson sphere, is that it completely encompasses a star.

If Earth were to (somehow) build a Dyson sphere, its circumference would be approximately the same as the Earth's orbit around the Sun.  MASSIVE structure!  Theoretically, there would be no holes in it (when completed.)  Maybe, 1400 years ago, there was some structure under construction."

"A primeira colocação dela sobre hipótese alienígena ser sempre a última aponta na realidade uma ""contaminação"" do olhar de análise dela. É preciso constituir as hipóteses baseadas nos indícios mais prováveis independente do juízo de valor pessoal. Quer dizer, um indício deve ser sempre tratado como indício, sendo assim, a hipótese de uma estrutura alienígena deve ser enquadrada nas possibilidades naturais e não descartada antecipadamente por ela achar ridículo de mais. Isso não é uma postura efetivamente neutra, uma vez que despreza a qualidade de um indício sem fundamento para isso.

Se em meio às análises, a hipótese de estruturas artificiais se mostrem mais adequadas, deve prevalecer até que outra apareça, SE aparecer. 
Ademais, são muito pobres conclusões acerca de vida em planetas, estrelas e galáxias baseando-se apenas em dados de luminosidade e variações de eixo, padrão e velocidade para determinar a realidade concernente ao que há na superfície destes planetas e estrelas, o que deve lembrar quaisquer cientistas deste campo as limitações que estão necessariamente implicados para qualquer tipo de afirmativa conclusiva, porque elas não podem ser mais conclusivas que as características genéticas que alcançam acerca da constituição destes astros, etc, que já dizem muito sempre. Outro ponto, por fim, é ter a ciência de que todas as análises tomam por referência os padrões terráqueos de informação (sobre vida, formas de vida, constituições relativas à vida, etc), o que é limitado visto que podem existir outros tipos de possibilidades de combinações no universo no tocante à vida, que não passam nem perto da natureza terrena."

Ok. Tired of hearing Civilian scientists ...     this is a joke right? From a spreadsheet basically they see a slight difference and then it’s not and “aliens”.   Lol
And these are the same people that scoff when I invoke God.
what a bullshit to just made this upp so they can keep getting money for there reserch  what a waste of money and resources. we cant even find a way to travel faster then light do that first before dreaming to go where we will never be able to.

"Being an engineer, this is my recent issue with modern day science and scientists. Either they will totally rule out something on a brim and will not even want to discuss it like God or giants or Atlantis. If you are a scientist, you should be thrilled to discuss subjects that are so bizarre that they are too crazy to be true. But then they will get up one day and start talking about Aliens because of one anomaly, even though there is no evidence of Aliens either."
How do you freaking come up with this bs giant alien structures???? How are you guys scientists fr.... I am in high school and could think of better theorys suck as dark matter or a black hole ubstructing the telescopes view of the light 😑😑😑
And that my Liege is how we know the planet to be banana shaped.

"This is the quality of US scientists these days.? Good grief.Obviously american academia is so well funded any half wit can

id say that looks like the planets around that star kind of lined up causing ups and downs in the light output
"Bottom line, she doesn't have any idea why this is happening.  And to leap from the base theory of planets causing this effect to alien structures, is ridiculous.   How far away is this star ?  Aren't we observing it from several million light years away ?  Meaning, what ever you are observing happened millions of years ago ?  What's mind boggling, is that science knows really very little about physics.  Maybe this phenomenon is a ripple in space-time, or in the dark matter that exists between us and the object.  How is it that we can even see that far without distortion, and why aren't the billions of objects between us blocking a direct line-of-site to this or any other object ?  Why doesn't science have 20 other possibilities between a planets orbit and aliens ?  There isn't any other rationale ?  Its one or the other ?  And lets be glad that our planet is nothing, tucked way in the middle of nowhere, because I'd have to think that civilizations that are a billion + years ahead of us might be able to irradiate us in seconds.  Its good to be ignorant and isolated sometimes  : )"

"these so called „experts“ have not realized yet that the universe and stars are electric. this means that such phanomena can happen without an object being in front of it. 
and when these highly payed „scientists“ find a star that flickers periodically they try to explain it with dyson spheres. 😂😂😂

"Well, that descended into madness pretty quickly"

"Extraordinary memes, require extraordinary captions."
"Was fun while it lasted but Tabby's ""mysterious"" dimming behavior is resolved as of 2018. No alien megastructures. It just dust, which interestingly was ruled out earlier but 4 dimming events were observed showed a unique signature consistent with dust clouds. The paper was published a few months ago."
That a scientist should stoop to this level of speculation.
"So, here's another experienced, highly intelligent astronomer putting her money on the ""natural"" phenomenon, and NOT anything related to a ""living"" alien life form. Interesting."
We don't know everything about the universe...so how you can say that it's the most mysterious in the UNIVERSE
"The most mysterious star in the universe?   Uh, no.  Not likely.  More like the most mysterious star in our glalaxy.  That we are aware of."
'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence'.  People say that all the time.  The word extraordinary can't be quantified.  You are totally convinced Eskimos can't speak French so you need extraordinary proof that they can.  However Eskimos can speak French or not even if all you have is ordinary evidence.  Or no evidence at all.  It has nothing to do with human emotions or feelings of ordinaryness.   They can be speaking French right now just our of your ears and change back to English as soon as they see you.    People have a big built in horror of the idea of other intelligent beings.  those beings may not exist.  but if they do they won't wink out of existence to make us less afraid.
What about multiple transits from multiple objects.
I've always wondered what if the transit was slightly off the plane to pass the stars light from Our field of vision maybe that's where all the aliens hide 😈😈😈

Thanks babe. Listening to your soothing feminine voice put me to sleep for a nap.
Boy it’s a good thing she’s taking the unexplainable “natural” phenomena. Claiming a big Death Star is out there could make a few people nervous.
"Perhaps this is the same object which made Saturn disappear in the 80's or 90's. I remember it taking place but can't find an article on it. 
So, in Russia, a giant metal hemisphere was discovered.  It's surface is covered in a ferrite based crystal structure.  It was, according to legend, used in defense during some ancient alien war. It may have been only half of a sphere. A stealth technology perhaps, as she seems to mention here, causing light to bend around which is exactly what positive ions do. It's an artificial ionosphere. Galaxy arms are known to lens light around them, fyi. Why not this?  
My hypothesis is this; there are megastructures in space made of spheres connected like strings of pearls. They look just like that part found in Russia that sunk into the swamp.
 Cattlemen years ago would hide under it away from the rain, until it sunk into the swamp. A radium coating may be present, which causes increased dielectric effect. Such a coating would make people sick like it did to the only investigation team ever to seek it out in a documentary."

"Probably 2 orbits making one transient. 2 stars with their own planets somewhat in the same line of sight from earth but positioned in off kilter arrangement. One could be in the +4x +7y and the other at like -2x-1y. One has a diagonal orbit, the other horizontal. Then for a period of time their planets together eclipse the further star. Then at a certain time a number of both stars planets are in a bit of a lined up order and we get that event with multiple transients all during the same time period. Then it all spreads out and repeats this somewhat organized kaos."

Maybe they have more than one planet in their system? The dips could be if more than one planet is aligned at a time. The asymmetric signal would then be because one planet leaves line of sight while the other is still transiting.

"First of all space travel is fake. 2nd we really don't know what stars really are, but they are not big balls of gas burning millions of miles away. Our world is enclosed by a firmament/dome. The earth is a circular horizontal/flat plane. Everything we see is within the firmament dome. I think stars are small (1-3 miles in circumference) of vibrating circular balls of glowing gases like neon, perhaps with electrical energy in them such as static electricity. If the firmament is clear & we can see through it, perhaps the stars are outside in the water very close, maybe attached to the firmament. Another theory could be the stars are inside the firmament. I was told the firmament is made out of carbon, same material as a rough diamond, & perhaps the firmament spins & thats why we get star trails, or they are lights projected on to the firmament like a disco ball does to a wall, also if you notice when disco balls reflect objects onto a wall, ect because of the round shape of the disco ball the objects half way down the wall rotate the opposite way & upside down. I believe that is what we are seeing when we get near the outer edge of the world close to the ice ring circle they call Antartica. The earth is not a sphere of top & bottom, it is a circular flat disc of inside the tropic of cancer which is 1/4 from the very center of the arctic circle, the equator is the halfway point going out on the flat surface & the you have tropic of capricorn which is the 3/4 mark & the edge is where the firmament dome sits on the very edge of the world. This particular area, is off limits to human beings, because the government doesn't want the world model to match up to the biblical model, because the masses would then know, without any doubt that the heavenly father the creator exist. Science that is about space & space travel is is psuedo-science. It's basicly science fiction, for example the sphere world is tilted 23.4 degrees, so that when subtracted from a right angle of 90 degrees you get 66.6 which is the number of the beast/satan. The sphere world was created by the evil Jesuits, & so was the names of moving stars called planets, which are not physical objects you can go to. Many people in the world are waking up to the lies, & indoctrination that has been forced on humanity. All this nonsense will be a thing of the past in a decade or so."

"It's very simple...there are beings with the power to make a star shine brighter.There  is an example of this ( fact ) in man's history.Therefore if these beings can make a star shine brighter,it is also logical that they can make it dim/ dimmer as well.Which inevitably brings us to the question. Is the data correct?......it is a fact that the universe is constantly expanding and that Stars die while new Stars  are born creating an awesome spectacle in space.Then there is this thing called ( dark matter) of which we know very little about.BTW has anyone figured out the science behind bread yet?"
Why can’t the star just have many satellites? Surely consistent dips are only created by single bodies...
what if there is more than one planet with different mass or size revolving the star with a constant speed and revolves the star at almost the same time....this alien thing is a bit strange bt this theory is more practical.

"I would think that any object between the Kepler satellite and the star could block the light, rogue planets or asteroids that are floating between solar systems, or maybe even objects in the Kuiper belt or beyond in our own system. Sure the odds are very low, but unless a pattern is established with the stars dimming, one time events may be the best explanation."
How much energy would it take to produce one of these spheres though? It looks like it would take all of the material the size of the earth
I think scientists concluded that it was a cloud of disintegrating comets

What is she trying to tell .....!?
2:40 she says mysterious star in galaxy. Title says mysterious star in universe.
Doppler Shift!
I am pretty sure this is all  a result of my mother in law bending over from time to time.
"5:07 - Possible reason for asymmetric curve may be that the object that is blocking the light, is a 3D object. It is somewhat egg shaped [ https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=48&v=Va6t9RoyJrk ]. As it rotates, its projected area on a vertical plane varies."
6:09 “the data were good (*awkward pause)”
"I literally hate all scientist , and doctors alike you have the tools however you still targeting society and the massive populations of people for study the only reason you're smart is because you all stole something from the ppl & y'all are never going to give it back"

"""Planets are circular""

"you want my take on it? it's a spaceship graveyard. all the craft are littered around it constantly bumping into one another in random patterns. that or it's a warning beacon thats my second guess, they had to make something specifically visible to far away stars, they knew about light dipping and built a structure to warn other stars at lightspeed for centuries to come long after they disappeared, the pattern of the increase and decrease may be an attempt at communication. if only we could try to match the pattern with any known language sequences and try to see if any of them make sense."
sooooo... what do you produce as an astronomer? sigh... i want her job.
Pick a tiny spot in the sky and observe a tiny fraction of the stars within it and find the most mysterious star in the universe.
total waste of money
I'm going to guess huge intermittent sun spots or fluctuations in the stars ability to generate  light itself is causing the changes.
Well we can't really trust NASA since we never really went to the Moon so we can really trust what this woman is saying.
"Space things : *block star's light*

"Holy, Carl said that quote? Mr. 42 is famous!"
Niburu?
Our galaxy is NOT the same as the Universe. We don’t know ANYTHING about the other billions of Galaxies... fake titles...
"Oh look, a funny woman. Probably an alien"
"If all these transits have the same asymmetrical signature, couldn't that be an effect of the way gravity of a heavy object bends the light?  The leading edge bends some light out of our view, but we don't see that until it obstructs light from the star. But then the trailing edge starts to bend light in our direction.  That would explain the more gradual return to brightness for an orbiting planet.  Just an idea..."
Or it could be several planets lining up in such way that their bodies overlap and create this weird shape.
have we checked for near infrared emissions that would be consistent with the massive amounts of waste heat such a huge construction project would generate?
"Sounds like a lot of embellish and extreme exaggerations to report the facts, thus causing more doubt than truth in whatever they think is going on in the great abyss of the universe."
"This has to be the most pathetic presentation ever seen on YT. She sounds & looks like a High School teenager nervously reciting her first Science report during the Senior Assembly, parroting nothing but Nasa's many Lies."
I'm not saying it was Aliens... but it was Aliens
I am shocked to hear that astronomers came with the idea of aliens first than red/brown star - normal star pair.
I guess 50 million dollars a day is not enough for NASA. What a joke NASA is. A complete fraud. NASA'S  only mission is to deny our creator.
its about 3 planets.. before they are align than they differ.
she is a star.

In spain we call that star ''Tabi''  or Tabita :)

4:18 flat earth theory proven.
"This has been solved-it was determined it’s a massive gas cloud that’s blocking the light, not a Dyson sphere."
Aliens are as natural as we are!  Humans need to change their terminology to enable a new paradigm of consciousness.
"In the year 538 AD something made that star deem or blocked the light that we can see, and now you're talking about aliens."
"So we have civilizations on nearby planets and moons and these intelligent astrophysics individuals are looking in deep space. Focus on Ganymede for instance. There are countless huge structures there. Seti is a sham, most of the professional astronomers are misled some are deliberate disinfo agents. Life is all around us. https://youtu.be/S_kmoQo5L8w     Take a close look at this NASA provided picture, yes get out your magnifying glass. Go to the 23 min. mark to start if you are impatient."
"She lost me in the beginning, damn im stupid"
Could all this fuss be over a brown dwarf companion star? I must have missed that part.
"What about Rogue Planets, there are indications that they're much more common than we thought; there could be more Rogue Planets than there are circling around stars, they may even be found in swarms, say 1 of those passed partially in the line of sight (slowly) of the star although at a much closer distance than the star itself .. I don't know, you get the point, would such disruptions be discernable from objects closer to the star itself?"
kabanetai
"Good to have imagination. The danger here is,  where we can get carried away is using all the theory with the imagination and not finding anything in the physical realm. This is not even clutching straws. It is opening a world to utter scientific garbage. Its nice though to have all the data and the computer prints"
It was probably the gigantic ship of Thanos that blocked the light of the star in unusual patterns.
"You can't put human limitations on extraterrestrials. 

That would be the same as ants putting ant limitations on us."
"Astronomy and Astrology were once (right up until the early 16th century), ONE and THE SAME SCIENCE = FACT. ...

Ancient Vedic science that is still alive and well in India, incorporates Vedic Astrology into itself."
WAKETFUPEOPLE.
duh.
this lady is insane
"""the data were good"" - ?!?"
This is quite far fetched
"Maybe a ringed planet with relatively dense rings and perhaps a few large moons which all combined to block out some of the light. Another possibility: binary planets (or even ternary, quaternary and beyond) planetary systems."
seems that the only thing she doesn't understand is Occam's razor.
That was a YUGE leap
"the *most mysterious star* in the universe is actually
madonna"
Could it be a binary gas giant system?
Hmmm science is picking the best of the worst ideas??
Useless

"The funny thing is that these objects passed that star yeaaaaaars ago, so if they really are aliens, they’re long gone by now. If we were to travel to that solar system and orbit that star right now, chances are there’s nothing there."

"they don't understand...but they teach what they don't understand, unbelievable! nd guess what stars are not as solid as your told. get yourself a telescope and so your own research than listening to crap of planet battles and dust flying in the air"
Why does she talk like she's reading from a teleprompter?
Ive had the same problem since british gas took over the power supply. Sudden dips in light. She should phone them if she wants an explanation. Altho for the first couple of calls I bet they deny it has anything to do with them.
"Ok , I'm not an astronomer but, I've arrived at at decent hypothesis to your asymmetrical transition findings... So, given that the "" stars"" in your studies are thousands of light years in distance from our observation platforms, given those distances and factoring in the possibility of other bodies passing between us... There are countless probabilities. these anomalies could very well be stages of planetary alignments or something similar In that area....  You science nuts over think and over analyze... Sometimes the answers are simple and unexciting...."

"Even if this data was actually the result of an alien mega structure, it wouldn't be scientificallly sound to propose this as probable. It's fantastic, but purely speculative."
"Multiple objects of differing sizes orbiting a distant star (like a solar system), and other objects moving through the solar system between them and us?"
What happened to Bill?
She said Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter.... Her Credibility seized immediately as an astronomer.
"its impractical, if they are that advanced im pretty sure they would have found us long before we found them"
"multiple planets orbiting said sun, traversing and blocking this stars light.   she suggests multiple comets or alien life forms building huge structures, but neglects to mention multiple planets.    two planets traversing at same time slightly out of line would explain the light curve's asymmetry.   Instead she resorts to alien structures, when the multi planetary orbiting system is the much more obvious.  Doubtful she is a very good scientist.   Perhaps she will get lucky."
Maybe its a liberal alien race and they are fucking up the solar grid?
Probably some space turd blocking the instrumentation.
"What about a double star system where there is only a small timeframe where parts of the stars would overlap from our viewpoint? With other words we look at their plane almost 90 degrees from above and their collective brightness is enough to appear as one star, but it's not a perfect 90 degree angle so while usually none of the stars would be hidden behind the other at any point there are small timeframes where parts of one star overlap that of the other. And i mean i'm as amateur as the rest here im more interrested in the answer even if it proves completly farfetched."
"Whats truly mind boggling is that, with all the scientific effort that goes into being able to witness that event,,, they still dont know how our own moon originated, or how it came to be oriented as it is."
CHEMTRAILS!:D
Talk bout that Michael Jackson fame huh?
A ring of debree that orbits the star in a certain angle?
Really?? I thought Earth is flat and all of the plantes are flat?!? How come you say they circle around sun? Sun is on the sky and plantes are on elephants which are on turtle for F sake.... got it??
"This ASSUMED all the planets in the Universe orbit on the same plane. We already know THEY DON'T ! Mercury is off by 6.3 degrees. Why isn't it possible to have a system with many planets much farther off ? Yes it is more likely that they will be on the same plane due to the magnetic field of the galaxy. But that doesn't mean it isn't possible. After all, out own star has a constantly changing magnetic field. Have a few stars changing at the same time could overrule the galaxy magnetic field and they might have orbits 180 degrees off, that would NEVER block the light from our perspective.
Go underneath the Sun and NONE of the planets would ever block any light !
And what about all the systems we can't see because we are on the same plane and closer objects are blocking the view ?
I can't even see a house 200 feet away since the house across the street , on the same plane, blocks the view.Let alone all the other houses in the plat. The closer ones BLOCK THE VIEW, just like what would happen with the stars and planets."

There are too many variables and possibilities to narrow it down easily. Too many unknowns. It could have been any kind of matter or energy behaving in a way that we can't understand yet or just in a way that we do understand but has not dawned on us yet. I do think that everyone would like to believe it's some insanely massive structure or Celestial body moving in such a way that would blow away anything we've seen before. On the flip side it could be something completely not exciting and humdrum. It might even be Marty McFly flying around in his DeLorean ...maybe he's looking for more plutonium.
This is what the avengers is about
"""Planet hunters"" you mean eve online players, your welcome NASA now give me my faction ships"
What a waste  of 14 minutes
What about a not so big object but extremely closer?
Your quoting carl sagan who insisted the universe had no beginning when proofs were coming out.
that theory was debunk in same minute the online people comment first....NO STRUCTURE and SHE IS RIGHT....PEOPLE HAVE WILD UNPROVEN IMAGINATION...ITS ALL NATURAL THAT IT MIGHT THE STAR GONNA SOME PHASE SINCE SHE SAID ITS OLDER THAN OURS....HOW OLD....8 billion years old...what type of star....it might be on its last legs cause like our sun ...its too gonna same process of increasing brightness and dips..but won't happen next 3 billion years  from now...when it start to increase size from 1.0 solar mass to 1.5 solar mass peak brightness would boil our ocean by its process...before it become red giant...2 possibility its a old star and lots of planetary debris that it might have 2 asteroid fields ..near the star and far from the star moving along its orbit...with giant Jupiter planet...... or a black hole
"Tabitha’s hot,women that know Physics are so sexy"
"the idea that a civilization will exhaust the energy from their own star seems kind of ridiculous to me.  it makes a great sci-fi movie or something, but why wouldn't they just use birth control?  What would they need with all that energy, and why would their technology not go the way our goes ... when we see an energy squeeze we conserve and engineer low power machines.  I suppose it could be the cosmic debris from a giant space war maybe.  I don't buy this ... sorry Freeman Dyson."

"in other words, artificial intelligence ain't so intelligent?"
Could it be part of a double star system in which one has burned out and circles the other as a cold dark dwarf dragging a lot of debris in its gravitational field.
"I understand the light drop/return in finding orbital objects; however, not all stars orbiting objects cross a path between our line of sight and their respective orbit.  Are we only identifying orbital objects with paths that cross our plane of sight?"
"When I see TED, I skip the film. The worst stuff."
UGH!  You couldnt build a Dyson Sphere.. even if it was only a single atom in thickness.. without cannibalizing entire solar systems worth of material.
"Well, that took a sharp left turn. It's probably a dynamic field of objects loosely held together by their mutual attraction and being pulled and tugged by gravitational forces of relatively near large bodies."
a Dyson sphere would have so much gravity that life would not be able to survive to make it. Also the gravity would also probably make things too heavy to even make anything of this size... people are so stupid especially scientist sometimes...   -.-
"Wow...scientist believe they have answers.  They really do not know what they think they know.  What she states as facts, are actually theories."
", all you gotta do is make that sequence of dips into a number file and then figure out the meaning of that number file maybe It will tell you something if I tell you it'll tell you"
Perhaps that star itself has a stormy surface.  Nothing blocking it but rather the surface itself changing intensity as a storm comes and goes.  Does the brightness of jupiter change as storms cut across its surface?   Can a star have storms that change the local brightness.  Or perhaps there are many planets that occasionally gang up to cross between it and earth at roughly the same time.   Our planets occasionally line up for example.   How would that look from a distant planet in another solar system looking toward our sun?
We're the only game in town. Extra terrestrial intelligent life doesn't exist...
Alien mining of a solar system. They destroy one body collect the debris. Then repeat this until the system is empty and move on.

"So many statements below, and so little imagination. How many came before us with such an imagination in the sciences, that turned out to be True?

"Hahahahahahah

WTF
LOL"
there's an engine underground that's over a million years old & they feed us this crap..... google David Adair
So a blip of lesser light across a star now equals a planet..... just wow.
make believe is fun!
"The wide range of variation in all factors, the in time between,  the depth, shape and duration of the dips is so unlike what we usually observe. Without parallels to compare it to in space, i started thinking about something on earth that might be similar. The best comparison I came with was a Gas Station. A wide range of vehicles with various fuel needs stop to take the amount of fuel the require or are able to accommodate. Some RVs have enormous tanks that take much longer to fill than a Prius or a scooter. Some require a more expensive higher octane fuel (deeper dip). It's an idea no more crazy than others, but perhaps what we are seeing is this star being harvested energy rather than a mega structure collecting it. Highly unlikely, but wouldn't it be cool if true?"
whats most mysterious to me is that it seems to be making a pattern but then suddenly changes right before the end of the mission
So basically you giving TED talk on something that you don’t understand. This is called “chut!ya katna” in Hindi language.
I think its the Nazis that escaped to space after WW2. They could be testing out a Death Start or smth
Didn't they just disprove this as space dust?
I'm pretty sure Uranus is blocking the light.

My point is that,  perhaps all existence is just made to make peoples asking questions over and over again... When the truth is just in their hands... 
For me, to get this science useful, they needs to develop sensors that can detect real-time observations of the universe and not the 2000years delayed activities pictures... 
Who know if at this day, all those stars had been blowed away and it's just their last lights that is traveling to us... 
Perhaps it's just an emptiness beyond those lights particles reaching us.. 
And we are the next on the list...

Best bad explanation.  Don’t you love scientists stuck on one explanation regardless of just how bad it is?  They would rather allow aliens than look at possible electric effects.  Wow.
Has anyone looked at electrical changes that might cause the observed phenomenon?  Are we assuming that an object passing in front of the star is the only explanation?  Sounds that way.
"I'm wondering if there is a Black Hole that is passing between us & this star. That would absorb a lot of light, wouldn't it?"
Computers don’t miss anything; programmers do.
"its the reapers, they are coming for us all!"

"No where going !! Aliens are demons, be sure!"
Why does it HAVE to be a single body blocking any light?
Seriously. .. Dyson Spheres.... ??
Errrnmm there’s a thing called hubble. You can point it at something and take pictures in space.
It's because the star is being followed by a younger star that's pulling power from the star witch dims the brightness. This is a new phenomenon and we find a handful of stars like this each year.

U say alien technology  making solar panel..  U must be fool saying that.  Don't u think they have better source of energy than just solar.

"Could it be orbiting a black hole along with some other stuff that is orbiting the same black hole but at a higher orbit? Every time the star goes behind the black hole it dips a bit, every time the material orbiting the same black hole catches up with the star, there is another dip. There might be some material in the inner orbit between the star and the hole, too. And because no material actually falls in, there is no radiation. (Part of me is thinking, come on, they must have thought of that, or, look at the data and try to find the regular dips for when the star goes behind the hole, but then again, you are not qualified, the other part of me says, maaan, someone's going to get a Nobel prize for that)."

"How could aliens ever find the building material to build a megastructure that can encircle their entire star? If they find it from other planets, then they wouldn´t have a problem with their home planet running out of energy resources: they can just migrate to other planets. And just consider how much energy goes into building such a megastructure. Besides, it´s extremely hard to imagine an alien species, no matter how big it is, to be able to build and put in place something like that."

Second... And idk how to explain it but since u can kinda see from when to when the anomaly happened and also u can kinda calculate when it was passing thru the stars light with a mass center u can calculate at what speed it is moving. With that u could check all the nearest light sources for interpretation in estimated time calculated from speed. I mean it would be very imperfect but it's some idea. Right?.. Am i dumb?!

"Even if their energy production produces heat, who's to say  they can't use that heat."
"what star? also: Earth transit? We are on Earth, so how would we measure it transitting? and again transitting what star? relative object sizes, relative distances from eachother and from Earth... so what is measured? How and in relation to what?"

"Computers only do what they are programmed to do, on the other hand humans have a vivid imagination."
"Maybe something like orbital blackhole around it, so it can reduce light when front side."
this is how the contact started.
watch out. its paradors. they eating people.
They should not rule out aliens if the Fermi paradox is considered.  We may have seen the first evidence of a space faring non human race.  It's entirely plausible given the age of the universe.  But as exciting as this would be in all seriousness is that it is probably a large object far away from the star that is blocking out the light like our moon can eclipse the sun.

space I wish I was born in a time of great space travel
"So if light is flying through space , for BILLIONS of years. As it travels on its way, the light waves kind of ""weed out the strays"" so now only Ray's pointing DIRECTLY at earth. They make a compact beam. Then  on the way a small ( something ) passes in front of it like a galactic federation ship in the opening to star wars. Not directly across the path but at a angle point first. Or maybe not point first. But in the process blocking part of our view and then continuing on. Just a thought."
"Whats sad about all this is that your just pissed away years of your life for nothing. Not to mention my tax dollars.  So you found a dip, so you might have found a star out there. 
How does that put any gain in what you may have learned, How is it beneficial, How is it practical.  Its not, its just a utter waste of time and money.  This is no different that digging up dinasour bones in the dirt. Useless waste of time and energy."
dense asteroid belt?
She sounds like Drew Barrymore
Is she wearing a giant kitchen rag?  why are lesbians so ugly?
"An asteroid turning around that star with a multi-angle shape and when it pass on the flat side the light is down by high factor but when it turn to itself the light pass in a higher way, just that."
"The fact she isn't employed by any space agency, neither government or private, is the first red flag.      The fact that she jumps to the conclusion of ""Aliens"" even when there is no real evidence to support that theory was the second red flag.  And the fact that she's dressed like she came straight out of a West Virginia trailer park was the third red flag.   So a bit of googling later and you realize she's nothing but a teacher at Louisiana State that had to fund her research through Kickstarter.........     WTF TED"

also, did she just use miles while talking about space? what kind of heresy is that?"
"What a lot of people fail to realize is that time, or rather the passing of and thus adding evolutionary amendments to this way of thinking, is relative to us from our own perspective. 

Who is to say that another evolutionary race of beings were 100 or perhaps 1,000 times more evolved than we were when we first picked up a bone to use as weapons in the fields and plains of Africa. 

It’s a bit arrogant of us to look at things in the universe based on our subjective evolutionary timeline."
I thought the stars name was tabetha boyajian
It was a miniature black hole
It 'aint nothing unless is reproducible. She lost me when she started talking about aliens. Be interesting to see what SETI has to say about it.
Probably just a planet from another star coincidentally aligned with that star and covers it.
"Shes sexy, everything she tells you are all made up and you won't even know...."
Watch out the Borg are on the loose.
"I either missed that part or they never considered more than one planet occasionally aligning. Some very large planets, possibly, with very large satellites and/or rings..."
Could also be a rogue planet nowhere near that star. Unless its dimming is regular. Just a thought. But it sounds more plausible than a Dyson Sphere.
"so it is where Thor's hammer was born, we just witness Thor making his new hammer."
"So what if there was a star with a planetary system between us and the KIC 8462852 and its planets move in front of that star. Since that solar system can be many lightyears closer to us, the size can be smaller to block out that much light. Kinda like our moon being able to block out the whole sun when observed from earth. 

It could also explain the irregular shape of the dip, since the light blocking planet is not in fact orbiting around the star that is being observed, so it could be passing in front of the star when it's on the edge of the orbit around its own star. It could be on its furthest point when moving in front of the star (and moving in the same direction as the observed star) and moving towards us and then be at its closest when it moves back out of the path of the star (moving in the opposite direction). That would actually produce the curve of slowly easing in and quickly easing out that we see here."
"I see: alien hypotheses can be used in scientific theories, but God cannot? How stubborn has this world become... Believe in Jesus and repent!"
The TED Cult
have they ruled out an object blocking the light in a much much closer distance to us? Since then it wouldn't have to be anything as big in comparison

"if shes pregnant, im glad the kid aint mine. ugh.
thats the only two possibilities?  someone hit me in the head with cinder block. nothing could be blocking what you're looking at other than stuff in the local solar system? over how many light years? please share your drugs with me."
A foam or ultra light material planet might have gotten in the way. Dunno about the duration issue though...
I think you discovered Cyrbertron.
"She is not a ""scientist"". There were so many completely ignorant thoughts put forward. The level of ignorance gave me a headache. When you ""imagine"" something , that is the furthest you can possible get from science. I can imagine up a whole list of alternatives that are more plausible and disprove every hypothesis she had. It's like a child just learned division in math class and now tries to explain calculus to you when they have no clue what it is. But hey , they will make what  they observed fit into their limited base of knowledge and assume they know something. This is exactly what is wrong with 99.99% of the people in our world today. They are not dealing with reality and their imagination is not based in reality.

Look. If a ""species"" was so advanced that they could build a massive structure it would be idiotic to think they didn't have alternative sources of energy or power. No species in the Galaxy with the capability to build that structure would need to do so for energy. Feeble minds of this planet know about ""zero point energy"" and other sources. It hurts my head how delusional you have to be to think they needed to build a structure around a sun for energy.

Ok. What is wrong with her ""imagination""? 1. She does not know all the factors. 2, She does nothing to gather more factors. 3. She imagines possibilities that are not realistic on any level. 4. Thinks she is a scientist. 5. You never imagine what is happening without the fullest understanding of what is happening. You don't look at a ""2d"" picture and expect to have me believe you can tell me the height , length , width , circumference and weight of the object. Yet people do it all the time. They are making guesses on bad data. They would be lucky to get 1 of the parameters correct. I see this ALL THE TIME. How have humans been taught to be so ignorant?"
"The thing I wonder why nobody seems to wonder that there was different ""ping""-strength like 4%,then 15%(03/11) and 20% and ""directly"" after 3 more.Shouldnt it be like 10%-10%-10%.... are almost the same?  But maybe its just very easy...this star have many planets...a very big one on a very large ellipse...like Jupiter...taking 12 years and Neptun 165 years,earth 1 year,Venus 225d.So in fact no Aliens needed..."

"Where would aliens get enough material to build this ""megastructure""?"
You know that you don't know anything. You lost in the dark.
"To construct a Dyson sphere large enough to block a noticeable amount of light from a star would require an immense amount of material. So I find it hard to swallow that IF this were the case here, the civilization's home planet would have enough material to construct one. I just don't want to automatically assume that if a civilization was advanced enough to create a Dyson Sphere that they would also be advanced enough to efficiently planet-hop to harvest the materials needed. Just a thought."
Maybe the star is orbiting a black hole closer each time
The cause is is interstellar dust
And just where would the resources come from for the ETs to build these planet sized structures?
"@5:40 .. I'm no scientist, but I believe the increase in blocked light means the object has moved closer to us therefore it appears bigger."

did they throw the meteor idea away? it sounded logic even if its rare doesnt mean it cant happen because even rare events happen once in a while else they wouldnt be rare they wouldnt exist right. it would be possible
"They assume so much in astronomy... They assume a star gives off a constant light, for example.
And then when a star doesn't give off a constant light, they call it ""an enigma"". 

But no, you just assumed half of your equation. And now you are perplexed if you find a star that deviates from your assumed variables. It's not a mystery, your assumptions are just wrong."
"No advanced civilization capable of actually building  a Dyson's Sphere, would ever BUILD a Dyson's Sphere. The resources needed would make the lack or loss of resources and need for one which started the idea in the first place to be impossible."
"Good, informative video. When you said, ""...learn up more what's happening.""... that was gold!"
Every single transit found by humans should have been used to make the original program better until it to could detect them all. And the cycle of human to program interaction should have continued again ala Deep Learning. Any program designed to detect things in data should go through a Deep Learning evaluation and refinement process.

"If this star is such a mystery, why doesn't it come up as a Google search suggestion?  I had to type in the entire star name."
"My opinion is. That is a magnetic field creating the first mega-planet, as happened with Jupiter.

Many planets are not solid. They are putting the speculations in white or black options.

It is a magnetic mega-field similar to the conditions presented by Jupiter in its origin, composed naturally by concentrated energy that does not follow long, and without being too solid, nor to be considered matter. It is the beginning of a new planetary system around the Tabby star.

The magnetic field is much larger than the actual size of the mega-planet will be, but the whole force is centered on a vorterix with a nucleus where the highest luminous drop is seen periodically. All the strength of what will become a new planetary system.

The magnetic capacity of the future mega-planet alters the wave of light. But the planet in appearance will be spherical.

In the normal luminicity of the star the data shows constant ascents and descents. Part of the normal life rhythm. Although at its birth explosion, the star has removed much matter from its environment. And that's why it is not appreciated in the dust environment but yes other elements. The magnetic field is capturing everything that accidentally enters to the region to transform it into a gaseous or solid future.

The effect is similar to a black hole that is getting bigger. It is likely to compensate for feeding by capturing matter.

As it begins to feed its mass of more nearby matter, it produces a greater effect as seen in the progress of the sample.

It is the same thing that happened with Jupiter in the beginnings of our solar system.

Probably from a distance, this singular effect in the light sample can be seen in the environment of young stars whose planetary system is still in formation and there is a magnetic field in its surroundings beginning to form a first planet. Axis of the future planetary system.

Personal note: Remarkable what they are able to see, they are really privileged people, both in intellect and in human spirit. My eternal recognition and my admiration, also my blessings."
Excellent presentation
"Here we go again folks.  First, it's aliens from Mars.  Now we have aliens making a star light dimmer.  What will it be next?."

dyson sphere is a crazy  hypothesis
"I thought this was solved already.. the explanation being the planets orbit decayed and was being pulled apart by the Stars gravity thus stretching it out into lots & lots of material, no explosion, no dust, just ripped apart... if they haven't solved it, then I just did....."
"Or it could just be that an object was not passing in directly in front of the star being observed from one side to another but came across it at a diagonal either coming towards or going away from the observer.  Different orbit by a an expected object of normal size giving a false reading. 
All was going well until the bizarre '1990's Disney movie sun panel theory' came up."
Asteroid belt orbiting around star. There's some fuckin science for ya. Did I win?
"What is the stars mass? If massive,maybe a small black hole is moving around near it,syphoning off light."
"I think the real problem is the unreliability of the dips. It it was a combination of planets and moons or really anything else in orbit around the star you would expect to see uniformity in the time between the dips, but they don't seem to follow any particular pattern. Perhaps non-uniform dust clouds would be the best natural explanation, but aliens are cool too."
Please tell me you adjusted the code to look for other examples of this happening. More data can be useful
Sure that explains everything...

Also, would a structure the volume and mass of which scale Tabby has described contain more nuclear energy from the put-together mass than the star it encapsulates at such vast distances??

"The star's behavior is probably something very simple, and very different from all of these scientists' guesses."
"If it repeated the same way again and again, it's something orbiting that star. But getting a bunch of weird date ONCE could be anything, some objects halfway between that star and Earth getting in the way, or whatever. They've kept tracking it and it does have regular periods of dips and they continue to be larger than expected, and some of them are irregular... and some are unusually large. Maybe it's a very busy system with a lot of planets, maybe there are large planets orbiting far enough out to occlude the star more significantly than we'd expect.

It's interesting. But there's no such thing as a Dyson sphere, even Freeman Dyson said it was a bad idea (in part because it would be gravitationally neutral to the star, meaning it would drift over and bump into the star - it would also probably take more matter than in an entire star system). There are other theoretical megastructures, but they wouldn't be detectable like that - and would probably have a much more regular appearance in the data.

They've overlooked the simplest explanation. Clearly, it's Space Cthulhu (not regular Cthulhu, he's already here)."
What if some aliens got some technology using which they are squeezing out energy of the star? May be they don't know we are observing when they are stealing it :)
"This looks like intermittent electronic failure, to me, it looks like a capacitor going bad in part of the observation chain.  This is exactly the behavior capacitors exhibit when they are going bad.  Occam's razor....massive, physics defying alien architecture, or capacitor failure...hmmmm."
wOw How truly she is laying
"If whatever is blocking the light of the star is orbiting it, then there should be a repeatable pattern present. This doesn't seem to be the case."
"These people seriously think that they understand the cycle and life of stars? Did they go in one? How do you observe anything about his core, when there are multiple layers, and the center is above all in terms of frequency and energy. Did they live billions and trillions of years? The evidence is few in terms of external devices, the evidence is great with internal advice. Mysticism and her philosophy is the only way anyone will know. Observe the patterns of creation, you will see divine nature. How can people be so arrogant, or so certain that stars die or run out of resource?

Light makes our very constructs in the material world, and allows consciousness. Our being is an Electro-Magnetic feild of photons, and in our very brains crosses the electric grid. A wire is plugged into an outlet, and the outlet is plugged onto a wind turbine, and a wind turbine is plugged onto the sun. Ever heard of a zero point? Forever. Not everything has a limit."
"If Aliens had started sucking energy from a star in mass quantities, this would show how big of parasites they have become, not how advanced they are. Simple right?"
"The complex bio-computer we call the brain was made by the very essence of light, there is no way that a computer constructed by something else could ever be better."
"I'm not challenging the notion that a Dyson Sphere is possible, but rather I have a question. Wouldn't it require the mass of a world or worlds of highly refined materials to even construct a partial Dyson Sphere? I could grasp the theory, but in actual practice it would seem a quite unobtainable goal requiring the destruction of many if not all of the rocky worlds, as I would suppose gas giants would provide little useful materials."
we are the only life in the universe. a star has never been seen born or gas collapse upon itself to form a star. whatever this is isnt aliens. it's just wrong data or you're not reading it right.

What if there's just some shiz woz somewhere in the space between here and there, not necessarily in that system? The asymmetry could be explained by an object that's orbiting around something closer, not part of the gravitation field of the star you're looking at. Maybe it's a system of rogue planets and it just so happens that the plane of that system is perpendicular to the line between us and the observed star."

Thanks for sharing😀👍
I initially thought could it be a planet that is much closer to the viewpoint that is causing a 20% dip.  A planet that is not in orbit around the star.  Then I realised if it was much closer it would only cause a dip for a very short period of time.  So that is probably not it.
Waste of time .
"an opaque object, like a planet or alien megastructure was passing in front of the star, it would block both red and blue light the same amount, says Wright. However, the astronomers found that blue light was blocked much more than red light during the star’s dimming. Since blue light has much shorter wavelengths than red light, it’s much more easily blocked by smaller materials, such as fine grains like dust. “This is characteristic of something that’s filtering the light,” says Wright. “That’s what you get when you have dust.”"
Don't believe a word anything NASA says.
What if it's an asteroid belt like the Oort Cloud. It makes much more sense if it's a highly dense and irregular Oort cloud with a huge asteroid?
"Its natural, and stupid that people think its alien."
"I have a Bachelors of Science in Physics and I am calling bullshit on this talk.  She has WAY too much faith in the incomplete science of Physics.  Astronomy is mostly conjecture.  We do not understand how space and time and electricity and magnetism work, nor do we have any idea what dark matter and dark energy are.  They are placeholders for the incomplete science.  So to make dramatic assertions like this to people who know less than you is abuse of scientific knowledge and research.  Scientists' jobs are not very interesting most of the time so I guess sometimes it helps to get imaginative..."
"This is a fake news. She claims to have shown a dip in Jupiter's U-shaped shadow, when she didn't show any. Again, she claim Kepler went on to other missions and more data are coming in from other probes, but does not explain why no other observations followed, implying the whole narrative is fake."
Started out scientific and went full stupid.
She's not saying it's aliens.......BUT IT'S ALIENS!!!!!!!

Couldn't it just be a VERY variable star.  Admittedly I wasn't paying attention for the first five minutes so she might have dismissed that idea then.
"So basically, the only thing you can really prove is that starlight flickers... everything else is an assumption."
The gradual dimming with the light snapping back sounds like the Deathstar
Fascinating.
Just thinking out loud...what if we are seeing a star is actually being captured by a small black hole. just like that funnel where you roll the coin into. as it gets closer to the center the period speeds up and relative size of the quarter increase.
What if it's something closer.  Holding a pinhead close to your eye would make it look huge.  It might have been something in our own Kuiper belt or Oort cloud that got in the way.  This would explain the one time happening.
space is fake
It’s.........”NIBIRU”....
Absolute BS
"Question: How do we know for sure the dip is caused by something within the system? It could be a rogue planet that is much closer to us, or a moon of that rogue planet(that irregular cycle). Something that is closer to you tends to block more part of a further object."
"I feel like I’m being sold something here. If the stars sing his praises, so will I. Check out the universe, at least what we can see with our technology."
Couldn't it be some rubble hanging around somewhere between the star and earth which caused these shadows?
"All these theories and no facts. Light that dips intensity. Something that we call a star billions of miles away has something  that crosses in front of it. What if the object that crosses in front of that star is 100 billion miles from earth where the star is 500 billion miles away? There are to many unknowns. Most of the money and time spent is spent on grasping for straws guessing. Most of it contradicts other findings. For example that the moon was created more than a billion years ago from a collision between the earth and another celestial body, but the moon pulls away from the earth at the rate of two inches a year. That would make the moon less then a million years."
Maybe there's a blackhole sipping light from the light the object produces or projected.. making the  data different from the original once it left the object.
"So, if an alien society was running out of power, how could they build a mega structure in space?"
It's quite scary to think that nutbags like her have any say in scientific research.
Resources coming from 10 or even one hundred planets with thesize of Jupiter can never create a Dyson sphere to cover a star as big as our sun.

What's wrong with saying, 'We just don't know!"""
More hogwash
But really no one has ever thought that maybe it is a star with giant sunspots??
The fact that the light is blocked without indication of heat re-radiation probably means the light is simply being blocked by a cloud of dust that is a long ways from the star. Say half way to our solar system.  We’re talking about a very small field of view.
BOOOOOOORING
"Not that it's a terrible watch, but for people familiar with them I'll save you about 13 minutes: there were some massive, unexplained transits in the Kepler data and after positing new stars, planet collisions, and massive comet swarms, they came to think it might be a Dyson sphere (or something like the death star, though she says this as a joke)."
Bullshit
Brown dwarfs or other cold lonely drivers without centerpoints could be the case. Imagine the distance from KIC 8462852 and Keppler. The space between could easily manipulate the light i.e. if a dwarf or other cold bodies went trough this passage and make residual to the signal if the distance is big enough. Its just probabilities the way I see it in contrast to this completely comic book causality that she ends up with. A star battle ... c´mon man
"It is incredible how many modern scientists can show so live interest about what happens years of light away while they don’t have the slightest interest about who is the subject which is able to wonder about all this. Much cleverness, low intelligence."
so maybe it's multiple planets with moons synchronizing at odd times ... orbiting at different angles
"I want to, but I can't get over the fact that she decided to wear a weird and terrible sack for her TED talk."
What if the nature of the planet passing between us and the star is a black hole?
That's no moon.....
"4:02 An orbiting body speeds up as it approaches its closest point to the star, then slows as it approaches its farthest point.  This is a manifestation of Kepler's second law; planets sweep equal areas over equal periods of time.  The ""asymmetry"" could just be because orbits aren't perfect circles.
7:39 I don't get why it would need to be ""hundreds of comets.""  The Inverse Square Law is still a thing.  There could be a much smaller number of comets (or any other object) that are closer to us passing in front of the star.  Half the distance means about double the angular distance it takes in your field of view.  This is why your thumb can cover up the moon in the night sky despite being so much smaller--it's _much_ closer to your eye.

Neither of these are mentioned as explanations for the ""spooky"" behaviors so I don't know if they just didn't think of them or wanted to be sensationalist and tease us with the prospect of Dyson spheres and alien space battles."
"I'm going with the ""Rule of 48."""

"Not a single planet... this is a clump of planet debris that can not re fuse due to the repellent materials in the clump. It's old but not going to form a planet. Oh, the repellent materials? Magnetic charged iron."
"Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence? No. 

Claims... require evidence. That is all. ""Extraordinary"" is an opinion.. an assumption based on one's current understanding. Example: aliens may be completely UN-extraordinary in the universe. The universe may be teeming with life. But from our egocentric position we (some of us) assume such a thing to be ""extraordinary"" so it must therefore adhere to more stringent rules than that which we deem mundane? Nonsense. Claims require evidence. That is all."
this is all nonsense. ARISTARCHUS  is the only star there is.
what if it's a planet with huge rings
"There are aliens on Earth, why not in space?"

"The truth is. Our modern-day scientists have little clue as to what is going on in these situations. Its a lot of guessing and even more speculation than anything else. This is a good thing, toddlers need to explore their environment because that is all how they learn. Our scientists are just very afraid to admit they know very little about a certain topic because they do it for a living and don't want to sound elementary. I have a problem when these types of scholars start making statements as if they are true, yeah right, your evidence is about the same as when a child says the Easter bunny is real because they found an egg in the garden. Often time things are hidden from us because its more fun trying to figure out what it is rather than getting the real answer."

"3:20 - 3:23 - Only in diameter, and that's a big different, than just simply says 11 times smaller. Jupiter is 121.9 times bigger than the Earth. That’s how many Earths could be flattened out to cover the surface of Jupiter. And Jupiter’s volume is even bigger. It would take 1321.3 Earths to fill up the volume of Jupiter."
"space is vast, maybe it's something far closer, maybe a rogue planet without a host star that simply comes between us and the star being observed?"
"what really troubles me was something this lady said in the beginning about the kepler project recording observations every 30 minutes...if the recording was CONTINUOUS the scientists would not have to rely on multiple FRAMES-EVENTS and interpolation  they would get the actual picture of the transition and things would definitely be more smooth and detailed on these graphs...of course the downlink wouldn't be able to handle this kind of load so...OK... 

the second troubling thing is the alarming inefficiency of the algorithms used to recognize the wanted patterns...if the people involved in the project initially, KNEW they had to look for outside help to identify events then something MUST have gone wrong with the projects pattern recognition algorithms and the coordinators knew about it and they also chose not to make it better for the scope of the particular kepler project...well...this is unacceptable...    

now about the weird data...i would have to say that my first hunch would be a planetary body passing in front of the star along with its SATELLITE and that would probably at least explain the asymmetry of the event pattern...  my second guess would have to be a planetary body of irregular non spherical shape... my third guess would have to be a planetary body passing in front of the star and COINCIDING with another planetary body on a different orbit which is a slim chance but still worth putting on the table...then the multiple weird event would have to be a complex planetary body like saturn...

however i'm not an astronomer...i have no idea if a planetary system can run such slow orbits so that planets passing in front of the star may explain the data !!!!!!

then the scientists would have to rule out a source from outside the solar system...i'm sure astronomers will be quite sure that they have mapped pretty much everything but the galaxy is a big place with constant motion and catastrophic events...it is possible that maybe something passed through or near that solar system that went unnoticed by our observatories like an asteroid field or something...who knows...maybe now with the new supercomputers that are coming we'll be able to do a much better job at watching the skies...unless they botch the job like they did with the kepler mission...two catastrophic failures in the targeting machinery...for the love of god... 

as far as the dyson hypothesis is concerned I would have to look at the nearest same sized stars in this star cluster and if the same anomalies were recorded there as well then it would be a great possibility...just letting you know though...if this is actually true we would be in the middle of the proving grounds of this civilization since the kepler's field of view was just 3000 light years !!!!"

"Her personal favorite is the idea that an entire planet got destroyed by a ""Death Star"" ... Yeah okay, billions of beings being vaporized is hilarious."
How do we know the supposed size of what is obstructing the light? Isn’t it dependent on the relative distance of the object between Kepler and the star?

"My guess is a massive asteroid field large enough and dense enough to act like a giant light screen or filter, on a flat plane. It would explain the duration, the erratic shapes and its hap-hazard nature as the field is not always in line with our line of sight. The further out the orbit of the field, the larger the relative size of it compared to its star."

"Was this data found by scientists checked against NASA's computer software results for this particular star? Meaning, even if the computers initially missed these dips,  wouldn't running the same data through the computers again either prove or disprove the proposed findings? Just wondering if this could be done to further any possible theory."
"I thought the explanation was more simple.  The light curve could be easily explained by a large satellite orbiting the planet, like our moon.  There would be more light blocked at certain times during it's orbit of the planet, and when it is lined up with our view, less light blocked creating that oddly shaped curve.  And of course, if you have several planets, some with large satellites whose orbits vary dramatically, you could get these results.

The problem I have with this sort of ""science"" though is all the assumptions being made, which seems common these days.  Seriously, look at the leap they take here!  You go from a dip in the light from a star and the next thing you know, they have huge alien mega-structures orbiting it!  Wow... this is not science, it is science fiction."
"And we think we know what is out there, and some of us think we are alone in the universe, that is so stupid to even think!!!"
Well y'see we built these nifty self replicating robots for a government military contract. Turned out to be a mistake because they dismantled every bit of matter in the star system to make more of themselves. What you're seeing now is the various swarms of robots blocking out the star's light as they pass. The weird shape of the dip you see in the light data comes from the shape of the swarm at that particular moment. They can use collected solar energy to produce a small reactionless thrust so the swarm orbits are not static and neither are the shape of the swarms. Hopefully all of these things are trapped around the star. it'd be a shame if one managed to get to another star system.......
oh dear

"My last idea is this, a star out of power, dead, with planets still orbiting it, that orbits the other star a long distance from it."
"if a planet is close to the star it will block less light, the same size planet hundreds of millions of miles away will block more. The moon is much smaller then the earth but still blocks 100% of the sun during an eclipse.  My guess is its a very large object in the stars kuiper belt orbiting very slowly, it could be oddly shaped like most comets or asteroids are.
The other option is that there is an object outside the solar system like a planet that has been flung free of its star floating through interstellar space."
"Alien superhighway. 

If aliens were to build such a superstructure where would they get the materials to do it? Even if they took all the mater in another orbiting planet it wouldn't be enough. It's possible I am missing something as I make no claims on intelligence."

"So they think the star light is only being affected by its own planets? They think theres nothing else in front of the star n the camera/ sensor whatever? Im sure theres other things passing through the line of sight not even near the star which could be a lot more than one object since theres a whole lot of space between the sensor and the star. Having a bunch of objects in between the sensor and star would explain the assymetric dips, not one planet."
"I mean, isn't it just as possible that something much closer to earth passed by us and got in the way?"

"Maybe it's an astroid passing between earth and the star but much closer to earth than the star, thus a huge drop in light readings.  Like when you take a photo of the sun but a tennis ball just 50 ft away flies between when you snap a photo.  Lots of light block and maybe that astroid had a trail of smaller rocks which explains the uneven light reading drop?"

Comets? Phew unlikely. More like aliens.
"Comets are a weak explanation but aliens and Dyson spheres are plausible?  How much money are we wasting on her ""research""?"
"Maybe the star has a crap ton of larger elliptical orbiting planets at extreme distances? Or planets of a neighboring, closer system that's blocking the view?

"I almost immediately thought it would have been comets/asteroids and I am not even a cosmologist, if moving towards or away from us relative to that star will make it asymmetrical, any notion of aliens is just ridiculous."
"I haven't looked through the comments yet so i don't know if this is an original idea, but it's my first quick guess:
Why couldn't it be the passing of a large planet, or two, with large and or numerous moons?  Possibly in addition, the huge planet has a uniquely huge and dense ring system, or planetary accretion disk, which possibly changes it's face orientation, like Saturn's when it more or less obliquely presents those rings, but with a more massive/dense ring system than anything we've seen in our own solar system..
So: A huge planet or planets, with huge dense planetary rings or accretion disk, plus numerous large moons, all orbiting that or those planets!?

"What always gets me is scientists like this female scientist, who bring up the possibility of aliens only to mock the idea of their possible existence.

It is possible that we human beings, on this speck of dust in the universe, are the very first advanced species to have sprung forth, however it is just as possible that we are not, given our chemistry, the basic building blocks of life on this planet, is almost one for one in the most common elements in the universe, plus as we are carbon based life forms, now carbon is the most fruitful element in the universe, you can make more from carbon than you can from every other element on the periodic table combined, so it makes sense we would be carbon based especially given how common it is in the universe, in fact it's the most common, it is just as likely that there is other intelligent life in the universe, with that in mind, I find it hard to understand why so many scientists mock the idea or possibility. Surely just because we have yet to find any does not mean that some exist, maybe they are not as advanced as us, maybe right now on some planet, an alien life form has just discovered how to make fire, maybe somewhere, alien life started millions of years before we did and they got wiped out, or maybe they didn't and are just very careful about allowing signs of their existence to leak out from their home, maybe the radio evidence so many look for past us by 1 or 2 thousand years ago. But so often these scientists go on as if nothing could possibly have past us by, even though if we had not developed the technology when we did, the red shift evidence that led to the big bang theory would have past us by without us knowing it existed, we would have missed it and would never known or discovered what it meant.

So yeah scientists always seem to make fun of the idea of aliens but the truth is, we really just don't know."
"Man, did I just watch this stupid crap?"
I think what is interesting is that they get funding to do this useless ****.  This benefits no one except the scientist doing it.

"If they’ve run out of energy, where did they get the energy required to build the new, um, energy collector?"
"What if something were blocking the light accidentally while continually adjusting its course, toward us.."
They didn't even take into consideration that not all orbits of planets around the sun are parallel to the light we see from our observations perhaps there's a planet that is circling the sun from a different angel and we see the planet moving from top left corner of the sun and it only looks like its crossing its path just slightly and what if that planet had a moon that was half its size that also spun around its planet surely that would add a 50% to its size that changed daily all these variables would cause just the dips they are seeing. in time they will see these patterns repeat as we compare it to better equipment being sent into space every ten years. and we will rule out or confirm the results of all past observations. We have a lot of space to improve ( see what i did there :)

Where's the extraordinary evidence for these claims and hypothesies?
What's mind blowing she believes that the Earth and moon was created by a collision and suns are born against all the laws of physics. And rather than intelligent agency. Only the faithful evolutionist would believe in aliens and deny the evidence of God's intelligence in it all and in our very DNA.
I feel sorry for science as we are at that awkward time where the leap to the next level is huge. They are measuring data and then being asked to explain it despite not having a vague idea of what we are looking at

A huge series of asteroid fields from planets either failed to coalesced into planets or leftover from the formation of the solar system or even a couple of series of catastrophic planetary body collisions. Chaos descend into order.
my bet is that there just happens to be an irregular dust cloud or debris field between the earth and that star somewhere along the way.

"Research electric universe. All stars are an electrical phenomenon, their light is from plasma discharge with the amount of light given off related to the electrical atmosphere, not the size of the star.
Brown dwarfs for example are like low energy fluorescent light bulbs, emitting most of their light in a narrow range of wavelengths, in their case infrared.
Most galaxies possess spiral arms because electrical currents in space naturally form into spiral currents.
The current accepted theory of star formation and evolution is wrong."

"What if there’s a planet that’s bigger than it’s sun, but the sun has enough mass to keep that planet in orbit? Then what if that planet moves slowly, which is why those dips would last a long time. They would explain the large dips of light. Unless it has more than one sun and they just can’t see it."
Damn clever those Armenians.
"After viewing this video, I read an article (on The Verge) from  january 2018 about the conclusion of this story, which apparently is ""a bunch of dust surrounding the star"".
In this video though, this argument seemed to be invalidated by the fact that dust around the star would be seen as some ""glow"" caused by it being heated up by the star's light (see at 6:56 https://youtu.be/gypAjPp6eps?t=416)

The the information offered here as the accepted possible explanation for the phenomenon is itself based I'd say at least 70% upon supposition, and that equates to nothing substantive."

"What about another ""solar system"" in front of the star that is a lot closer, but doesn't have a ignited sun? i mean common there is a 1000 reasons this data would show up that isnt even related to that specific solar system with out looking at it the first thing i thought about was planets that had crashed in to each other, and if it had not happened recently and it kept colliding with stuff as it moved it might cool down with out having anything hot enough to give of a light signature. then have their orbits beeing obstructed, or a something with a unstable orbit around a sun so it keep changing its positions, because we have objects that go around our sun in  stable orbit doesn't mean every star will have it, things change if a large planet loses it orbit and moves everything else around it quite possible that the orbits gets fucked up and there is no easy orbits to track. it might be that there is a new class of ""Planet"" where its basically just a gravitational cluster of large derbies orbiting each other making weird patterns, the options are there. Now i assume that there isn't a object as massive as a black-hole in the area and that you would have seen the fluctuation of the stars movement if that was the case the likely hood of a Alien mega structure is abysmal even if you look at a billion stars, not only will bacteria have to be common, but also Intellect will have to be common, the chances that a planet is in a stable orbit around a sun that has intellectual life that then advances technology for long enough to leave their planet and make autonomous replicating  robots to create mega-structures around their sun to capture energy sounds unlikely not only because how bad energy transfers over distance but also because creating a basically limitless source of energy from fusion should by then be possible for the aliens not forgetting that they could literally find other planets/asteroids to get enough resources to get more energy leaving you with a basically limitless supply of energy before you start harvesting the sun. and all this will have to happen at the SAMETIME that we are alive, and at the SAMETIME that we are looking at stars, i find this beyond unlikely its idiotic to even mention it as a possible reason with the data provided. if i where to make a Dyson sphere would use the natural cloud of a star as the starting point, this would store the energy as it would supply me with a lot of materials for building and it, having no ""dust"" around it seems to me enough of a reason that there is not aliens, and yes i realize that the dust would ""settle"" at some point but the time this taks its likely that they would have sendt more autonomous robots to more stars to make more Dyson spheres around neighboring stars since the time it would take to make this is MASSIVE having it ready for your next set of colonists would be a logical step, even if they have a lot of space left around that specific star having a backup colony to go to would be obvious. its like we are already looking at mars and talking about Terra forming it. you have to start long before you need it. and also if we can see their sun and they have lived long enough to make a Dyson sphere around their sun i can already 100% grantee you that they have send t satellites giving data from the closest million stars and since we have seen no such thing i even more doubt the Aliens theory (unless its already crashed and burned on earth sprouting the life we have here)."
720! Where the 4K at? Right TED is too poor / dying.
"Happy to see no flat earthers, #TeamJesus or #TeamIslam here. A safe place for the enlightenment advocates to congregate in peace is the TED lectures"
"I imagine the data witnessing a natural event.  A planet undergoing gravitational slingshot.  It's trajectory coincidentally in our direction which could explain duration and increase blockage. Then the data shows that planet reaching aphelion within its hyperbolic orbit and then orbits outside our ability to observe it.  Later that same planet crashes into another large object creating fragmentation and debris that crosses our line of sight. ""boom"" [clicks Comment]"
There's a much simpler explanation. There could be another celestial body outside the star system passing between the star our telescopes. Maybe it was a planet like Jupiter with a vast number of large moons. The simplest explanations are often more probable but admittedly less sensational.
SO something hit the planet and now rocks are spinning?
She's obviously an alien.
but what if those light curves resulted from sunspots (or shall i say starspots) on the surface?
If we aren’t seeing the same patterns rotating around that star then it has to be non linear object(s) to us. Meaning what if it were a bunch of huge moons that rotate around several planets ..
"Sadly, humanity will never live to go outside solar system (and why should it) and we will never know the real truths out there..."

If the data doesn't match up or works against each method than you proved that there is no planet...but something else! Or multiple planets that got too close to each other"
I still doubt its an alien structure. but sure its a possiblity
"Don't know if anyone can answer this, but how do we know for sure that the objects are that massive? To me it seems more probable that it's a smaller obstacle which is closer to us. Kind of like: the closer the object blocking the light is to us, the more light it will block. Like a bird obstructing line of sight to the sun - which is a tiny object but can greatly affect the light we recieve due to its proximity. Surely this anomaly could be explained with asteroids or some such obstructing our line of sight?"
Can't believe I was snagged for 10 minutes before I realized it was a BS liberal depleting our natural resources fuckwad fary tale.
Why is it not possible that the larger dips in the graph represent those times when multiple planets in this solar system aligned with the line of sight of the telescope from which they are being observed? Wouldn't we need more time in order to determine whether these fluctuations occur at the predictable intervals that one would expect to see in solar systems?
this speech was super captivating and interesting :)
Is she pregnant ?
"Maby only crossing objects with where more nearly (perspective) then observed sun. That would be my first interpretation without thinking more about.
Please comment it."
Now imagine... You are looking at something which is light years away - through a straw... There is endless space between the end of your straw and the object. What would you think could all pass through this line of sight. Maybe even just a tiny piece of dust or a fucking piece of stone or ice tumbling around. Right in front of all the sensitive sensors whilst scientists on earth wondering wheres the flux... What a smart world we live in.
"pretty simple, if its periodic its surrounding the star, if its not periodic its just somthing passing in the line of sight, that can of course be anything, why search for aliens, really?..."
It’s hard to say. It could be multiple planets of elliptical orbits. And just nice the dip is caused by these planets that happens to line up in front of their sun once every 1000 years. If we keep observing it for the next million years and it doesn’t happen again then maybe it could be a rouge planet passing by. Or who knows it could be multiple things passing by between the sun and us. And it doesn’t have to be close to the sun. It can even be near us. No one knows. Unless the signal is repeatable.
Fake. Earth is flat bruh.
What if the occulting object was much closer to earth than the star is?

"how tf did they get findings to equate to an alien civilization, in which, have created an enormous solar energy collection system or had either just began a war with, literally, planets?"
What a great way of sending coded messages through space 🙌
So you get all your data of of nasa.
"The star is so far away that a huge amount of things ( planets, stars, asteroids, etc) could have passed between the telescope and the star, why would they claim there is nothing passing by? it is silly and arrogant to do so. Even a smaller object closer to the telescope than the star would cover a large % of it's light ( from the observer perspective). This proves how early stage this research is. The galaxy is incomprehensibly enormous."
That pesky fly on the camera tho.
"space station, or fleet"
Most likely that star is black hole right now 😂 only few will understand
Its the death star
"This doesn't sound very hard to understand at all. Imagine a star with let's say, 50 planets. All those plants go around the star at varying speeds and orbits, some are panetoid, some are gas giants, some are dwarfs, some even moons, comets and asteroids.

Our solar system is very ordered, but who's to say that all solar systems are ordered like ours? What was probably observed was a series of eclipses, gas giants coming passed and into alignment together blocking light for long periods of time, with smaller planetoid bodies, moons and other debris passing by all at the same time. What was probably witnessed was a 1/1,000,000 year event in that system, and it would take another 1,000,000 to witness that event again.

That would be hard to explain."
Sounds like a star that has dozens of planets.
How about a system of planets are aligned with our earth.
"so, what's that turlly? Alien? dust? or data mistaken?"

Maybe a few planets like Jupiter and Saturn passing in front of the star at the same time?
"Where's the theory that an approaching starship periodically obscures the star, more and more as it gets nearer?"
"Why do astronomers think they can gauge the area of transiting objects by how much they dim the star's light? I get it, you detect the transiting body's tug on the star using the star's red shift to get the object's mass. But you don't know if the entire area of the transiting object is crossing within the star's. How do you know that the orbital plane isn't angled so that only a portion of transiting planets cross the star? This throws off measurements, making transiting bodies seem denser as their masses are incorrectly determined to have less area.

Also, objects much closer to us don't have to be that large to dim the star's light. Larger Ort cloud or Kupier Belt like objects may be far enough from the star to obstruct its light without absorbing a detectable amount of heat. A fruitfully can fully block out a star without absorbing enough of its heat to be detectable by any known instrument.

I wish an astronomy could respond to this."
"I'm sorry, did they explain why this couldn't be a massive star, or blackhole, and I missed it? Admittedly I am sleep deprived and only watched this once."
Maybe it's a blackhole blocking our view of the star??
what if the gaint  structures have some tech that they can teleport the massive heat into warmhole
no

You dont need these liars to explain anything! Just take your Nikon p900
"don't get fancy guys.  that's not an alien structure  . they definitely   missed the calculation . for god sake that star is millions of light year away from us, and we still relay on flux changes to find  the earth  like planet , that seriously pisses me off. god damn it motherfuckers."
"Why does no one seem to consider the star's light may be blocked by object(s) somewhere on the path between that star and the solar system/Earth? If relatively close to us, the objects could be quite small. What if it's just some asteroids out in our Sun's Oort cloud? A clump of them, traveling slowly through the light path, plus the Earth's motion through their narrow shadow cones, hence the complex light drop curves? Also explains the non-repeating signal nature."
"4:15
Seems to me another possibility, apart from not being circular, is two overlapping objects? Unlikely, but needs to be considered. (I may be jumping the gun here 'cos I haven't watched further yet)"
this is simply because 3 stars are revolving around each other
just shooting into the blue since I have very little knowledge about astrophysics: What if that anomaly are multiple planets that of somewhat equal mass and in contrary to the earth and moon they are revolving around a middle point between them (much like a dual star) while revolving arround their host star.
"3:18 No wonder. Have things gone this far? I mean, wouldn't that be us?"
maybe the passing planets have (several) moons ???

What about binary planets that are exiting their gravitational fields on each other sling spotting each other in an elliptical orbit?

"Wait, why is the woman repeating the knowledge that we men discovered ?"
"Can’t explain it with “human knowledge,” so let’s just say “Aliens!”
How about this: humans don’t know squat. In ALL the vastness of our experiments, tests, research, and studying and observing and everything else we’ve done since Jesus walked this earth, we’ve hardly scratched the surface. No doubt, we’ve done incredible things as humans, but surely there is WAY more to everything around us than we will truly ever understand.
Perhaps it’s as simple as “there are planets much larger than Jupiter?”
Perhaps it’s as simple as “pure coincidence that we happened to observe the star just as a planetary alignment occurred and we witnessed the ‘main event’.”
Perhaps there are other objects between here and there - such as rocks/planets without a solar system causing this. 
If a planet the size of Jupiter is near the star, it causes a 1% drop in light, but what would an object the size of a bus do if it were 98% closer to Kepler than the star?
Even better: what if we never find out the truth? Be prepared to accept that."
I spoke with Henrietta about these data.  She is convinced this is an irregular pattern variable star.  The inexplicable drops in magnitude are caused by this amazing star itself.

"Light gets measured. Dips are observed.

"If you look our planet by the equal distant of your star or star system you will see the same event plus we do have the asteroid belt that limits the density of the expose light and many planets in our solar system  , so in my ""little "" mind that i have i thing you have experience that phenomenon but on a much larger scale . I think you have fount a really big solar system with many planets across (at list 14 )  and at that given moment of time you saw a possible lineup of planets. Now i can not rule the possibility of anything ( Aliens , Star Trek tech or ....something else !) but ....who knows !"
it would be touching if the consensus focused first on healing our home and life source rather than chase populist satisfaction in unobtainable conclusions based on theory..
"WOW!  Not only are know-nothing men once more critiquing a REAL scientist, but they fail to note it's HER star, and REAL scientists around the world know it.  You think you know more, then YOU tell them what's happening.  Until then keep your nasty comments to yourself."
"I keep thinking this is a planet that has captured a large number of moons and asteroids in its gravity, and they appear as an elongated cross section that is less dense at its edges and more and more opaque nearer the planet.

The project proposes to use the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network for continuous monitoring of the star. The campaign raised over US$100,000, enough for one year of telescope time.
Furthermore, more than fifty amateur astronomers working under the aegis of the American Association of Variable Star Observers have been providing effectively full coverage since AAVSO's alert about the star in October 2015, namely a nearly continuous photometric record.In a study published in January 2018, Boyajian et al. reported that whatever is blocking KIC 8462852 filters different wavelengths of light differently, so it cannot be an opaque object. They concluded that it is most likely space dust."
"She covers her bases well with skepticism. Hangs the carrot, uses your imagination . we need some money poeple ."
So what I gather is that we have officially discovered a Dyson Sphere.
"naw, what is there to understand, its the same guys who move around stars in void spaces for reasons who knows why...
i mean its nothing new


lol"
Two thousand downvotes. Where's the flux?!
"What if the dips are not coused by object much closer to that star than Earth but things which are in between? A smaller object closer to the Earth like a planet of another star can cause big dips. More such planets can cause very interesting forms of dips, which of course hardly can be explained by few planets orbiting around the observed star."
"What about a planet from a third system that is between us and the star? In would blocks more light because it’s more near to the earth, so it would looks bigger. the irregularity at the end of the “eclipse” would be caused by the planet turning in the orbit around his star (and getting “smaller” by getting more distant). Even bigger irregularities could be explained by supposing that other planet (or satellites of a single planet) of this third system could blocking the light in their orbits (maybe during their aphelion), getting really distant from their star."
"Well this was 2 years ago. Now they're saying it was just dust.

Simple.  A spider was crawling on the telescope.
"Giant gas planet with lots of moons, rings, and comets."
Nasa's Kepler mission...? or Faked moon walk ? Lol
It was just dust 😢😢😢👾
Is it just me or does she start to get really really nervous towards the end?
😪
Her shirt is distracting me.
Three body problem involving brown dwarfs and host star?
"Ain't seen the video yet, but it's called Tabetha Boyajian so It will be interesting to see what else is up with this star other than the weird name"
"It bothered me way more than it should have when she said ""But were looked really, really, really hard and.. the data were good."""
Could it not be comets closer to earth? Surely that would block lots of light?
"at 3.20 she says earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter.  Quite wrong indeed .. it would take 1300 earths to equal the volume of Jupiter.    If we are talking about diameter, then 11 earths would span Jupiter, but she didn't say that, did she ?   Interesting talk though."
How far is that star? We are talking about things that happened a lot of light years ago.
im an alien and im not offended
alien scientists selling books thats all
"What purpose for? It just for ""hobbies""."
Ask Larry Niven.

"Guy 1: There’s something obstructing the light of this star that doesn’t appear to be spherical
Tabitha: ALIEN MEGASTRUCTURES!"
"And John Podestas wikileaked emails, tell us otherwise..."
sorry if this would sound stupid... but what if there is a black hole nearby to that star that is sucking parts of the light
"Ok, so I LOVE this scientist! You are super cool, Tabby!"
Isn't the easiest explanation a lot of moons or planets aligning?
"Were black holes involved here, nah scientists would have checked for gravitational waves..."
Maybe it was a really huge planet that was breaking apart under its own weight.   And then the next year you see it broken in a lot of parts.
der der derp de derp
What if it's a spaceship? Like it was coming back and forth and block the star loght
"Yep, what you have there is called a wobbly orbit.  Depending on where the planet is in its wobble, it will block out more or less of the sun.  Would you believe a giant moon orbiting a tiny planet?  A smudge on the lens?"
"BUZZKILL: IT'S A DUST CLOUD. It isn't an alien artifact after all.  In January 2018, after further observations at different wavelengths, scientists determined that the light is dimmed by a dust cloud that intermittently passes in front of the star."
There could be so many other things happening than “extraterrestrial life”. Anything from faulty equipment to comets like she said.
"I am glad they did not use blockchain in any of this. (Bitcoin blockchain operates at the rate of 1 MB per 10 minutes). Calculating huge amounts of data on home computers without blockchain is already possible, and way cheaper. Shady software companies try to sell blockchain technologies for processing cosmic amounts of data, and run an ICO on it, without realizing that processing vast amounts of data is more efficient WITHOUT blockchain. (I am a flat-Earther, so I don't believe in existence of observable objects greater that Earth anyway, but at least I agree with the speaker that blockchain should NOT be used in such research)."

"DUDE...  They didn't clean up the dust to ""recycle"" it, THEY WERE PLACER MINING!!!  In California during the Gold Rush, miners would use fire hoses to blast entire mountains into rivers of mud that they could then sluice for the gold they were seeking.  Well, just imagine the same process on a planetary scale.  Alien finds a planetary body rich in whatever it is they're looking for, so they simply pulverize the entire mass so as to vacuum and sort the material before moving on to the next potential deposit.  Whaddaya think boyos?"
Content good delivery bad
Could it be something planet sized (or mjltiple objects) alot closer to earth?
Could It be a black hole?
"not a planet  for sure

planet ahve fixed rotations , my gues would be a deathstar"
what if the planet had a huge moon that would interfere? Or big rings?
"If there are aliens out there and their technology is so advanced as decribed, i think we would not get a chance to observe something happening out there a thousand/millions of years ago."
Couldn't just be... something we still don't know? Have we discarded all those possible causes that come before the alien-made megastructure?  Ignorance is quite far from being an evidence.
"With a last name such as Boyajian,she could be of at least partial Armenian descent.Also,she sounds like quite an intelligent person,friends.God bless her."

"GAS BONDING fact totally destroys Einstein's Space Bending, and Newton's Gravity/Black Hole/Gravity waves !


All downward falling MOTION including Newton's apple, begins when active rising gas molecules in MOTION as an Energy Flow becomes trapped BONDED together within the process of making solid object's.
This is scientificly known as the mechanism of gas bonding, which take on a state of solid mass blocking out its electrons motion, it's fire power, Thus become energy lock lifeless dead gas molecules, and falls downward in real time, following its electrons unlimited potential velocity at the speed of light, connects downward with earth surface energy conservation system activity's at quantum level's, establishing a downward falling path for trapped Energy Lock lifeless dead gas molecules/solid objects only.

Equating the above fact with Einstein famous equation E = MC2  

E = ENERGY = MM = MOLECULE MOTION = Molecules in motion within star flames earth gases birds and balloons plains and rockets, even us humans rise from molecules in motion creating an energy flow, the ruling force of the universe. 

M = MASS = GB = GAS BONDING = Gas Bonding take on a state of solid mass blocking out its electrons motion, it's fire power, Thus become energy lock lifeless gas molecules, and falls downward in real.

C2 = LIGHT SPEED = E = ELECTRONS = Electrons Unlimited Potential Velocity at the speed of light connects downward with earth energy conservation system activity's establishing a downward falling path for trapped lifeless gas molecules/solid objects only.

Gravity is a mythical concept that's mentally applied by Newton,  solely to guarantee needed results to it's point of origin  , the BRAIN  !"
If is that so then the results must be constant if is that so
FOOLS. You discovered the 13th black crusade.
I feel it can also be because of a dipolar star system in motion. It can be sister pairs of different time scale. A much younger star of fainter light could probably revolve around a much mature star of relatively larger size and more intense light. This could explaining the dip of about 25percent in the data.
NASA said aliens
It was solar panel is ain't that like don't you think it would give off heat
Heat transfer Beauty the Heat objects or cold
That's what NASA finds but I would stick with the the science of the situation you know cluster of comments what happened to an ice cube when it shatters
Seti yeah they're singing to me
Sadly I live in the state where NASA from ?????
Cluster of icy comets that are attracted to Sons like the sun  like. The one we got
You know it you will not win save your selfish self or save the world

We found a trade route of an alien race way way out there. Yuh
"Aliens are invoked in history and science as ghosts and gods are invoked in the past. If one day it would be aliens indeed, intelligent people will not believe, while the stupid ones that always believed in false aliens will say ""I knew it all along""."
Dont you just hate Womansplaining?
Why not just say there could be many multiple planets in said system with irregular orbits like our own Neptune and Pluto and that our line of sight happens ro align with an irregular exchange between planet orbits?
"Aliens? Artificial megastructures? I don't see how you can exlude the possibility of something like an /orphaned/ asteroid belt in the interstellar region somewhere between the stellar system and earth. I can cover the entire sun (i.e. cause a 100% dip in the ""measured"" intensity) just with my thumb between the sun and my eye. Do I have a mega-thumb? When you observe 150k stars over a period of time, this wouldn't be the most improbable thing to see. Nothing mysterious here, except for why one would assume that interstellar space is completely empty by definition and nothing would be able to cross the way of light. Sounds like a very reasonable explanation for the observed phenomena to me.... or am I missing a point?"
This is where I ask what about Solar Warden?
Maybe is Santa Claus delivering gifts in that System
Where would the materials come from to build this?
Stupid
this was all science and interesting until the History Channel Meme showed up.
"It’s always so awkward when the speaker says something they think is hilarious, but the crowd is silent."
Maybe it’s a black hole orbiting the star.. At a great distance. So its gravity bends light out of our LOS.
"""Even Alien mega-structures cannot deny the laws of physics""..... Now that seems like an arrogant statement. How would we know what an advanced alien race is capable of?"
This is trash.
"And what about a normal solar system? I mean, let's consider there is 1 planet in the field of observation : it looks like this : O.  Now there is 2 , it looks like this :Oo  or even 3 , then this : OoO. Each time the light will vary in a quite random matter, isn't it?. But don't get me wrong, I'm a alien fan!. It would have been interesting to have Voyager 1 equiped with today's technology to observe variations of our sun light."
What's the 2nd most mysterious star in the galaxy?
"""The most mysterious star in the universe"" You cannot possibly know this unless you know every single detail about every single start in the universe. And even then it would largely be a matter of opinion as to what makes it the ""most mysterious""

Morons."
The most mysterious star in the universe? We can't even make out the individual stars of other galaxies. Or stars on the opposing side of the centre of the Milky Way.
"huh, could it be a black widow binary system? As in a tiny black hole orbiting that star."
"Okay, that was good! :O"
Where does Ted find these people?  That guys got some strange friends.
It’s a neutron star
In today's world it's easy to be a loud voice that hasn't earned any volume yet.
Is tax payer money going to support this BS as real research?
"What if it's a bunch of gas giants with massive moons that are in alignment with one another. In other words, these giant planets and their moons orbit around the star at various distances, but they have very similar times that they orbit around the star. Sometimes, they wouldn't be aligned perfectly so you get a massive spike in the data. Other times, they're more or less perfectly aligned, so the planets overlap each other from Earth's perspective, so the dip in light that we read is much smaller.

Also, WTF is not an acroynym - it's an abbreviation."
A lot of these ted talks are nothing more than r/iamverysmart
"why wouldn't this just be a solar eclipse of planets in front of the star? they are just measuring the light from earth and the star if multiple planets come in between, you would have your answer...right?"
Wow this went awol real quick
"We cannae change the laws of physics! Ref a comet swarm, given that Pluto is a lot like comets (ice, rock and stuff), could be an ice planetoid forming."
This is more fantasy and speculation and a waste of even more money on pseudo scientific rubbish. Variable stars are common we need only look at our own. Space battles? Horse Hockey!
"I think she is a star.
No....seriously.
I think she is an actress that was hired to deliver this presentation.
When I consider her personal speech mannerisms, I am reminded more of a grade school teacher than a ""scientist"".
I will give her the credit she deserves for memorizing the script verbatim... she gave a great presentation, and connected well with the audience; both of which would have been outside of the expected personal skills of a true scientist.
She was the true alien of interest."
"4:15 ringed gas giant in far orbit. The the slope at the begining are the rings blocking the light, then the planet itself.






I want my like"
S T O O P I D :/
"I'm 6:20.  Several things.  The distance of the planet from the star would affect the amount of light blocked.  So would a binary planet.  If the planet's are aligned, one would cover the other, acting as one planet blocking.  As they rotate,  they would then be side by side from our vantage point blocking give or take twice as much light and any range in between."
I am very pleased with the possibility of an electric universe =D and there the light intensity depends on the galactic input of the surrounding plasma :)
"surprisingly good talk. all the people thinking its some pseudo-scientific or other mumbo jumbo are IDIOTS. Maybe thats why they didn't get the scientific part, and how the scientists even arrived at such a theory. The data, if true, and most probably is as she said, has some very big implications. but people are just unable to grasp the immensity of this."
all these what if crap.. Read Bible and ask Creator
"Sorry Taby, you are crazy!"
"if something was advanced 1275 light years away, we would have known that by the radio wave transmissions, for approximately 100 years"
Why does everybody assume if aliens exists they must be more technologically advanced than we are?. Maybe we haven't found them because they are dumb in our own standards. They have no idea what computers are...
"The people in this comment section must have the universe's most powerful telescope bc they think they know tabby's star so intimately, more so even than the actual astronomers. They blurt out confident explanations and disavow any other hypothesis as if they're idiotic and impossible."
Im i the only one that thought the stars name was Tabetha? lol
"There is tried and true knowledge that concluded a woman's place is in the kitchen, not a lab.  (just kidding)"
"Start with a quote about requiring evidence, and an assertion that aliens is not a good explanation - and end by demonstrating a lack of knowledge about dyson spheres, and saying it might be aliens.

she wouldn't be that bad if she wore some make up and some decent clothes
Personally KISS or Okhams Razor.
"flat earthers are at 2K dislikes... keep it up, fladdies!"
Fascinating topic. Dreadful smock she's wearing.
Hello.  I am giving a Ted Talk on the same exact topic.  Here it is:  We have found a star in the universe with anomalous behavior.  We know nothing about it.  Everything is conjecture.  Thank you.
She's a terrible speaker.
"To anyone watching this now, sorry to ruin your hopes of aliens but it turns out it is just dust, different dust than usual but still dust: https://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/tabbys-star-dust-complicated/"
I can knock this talk down to less than a minute... we are looking for funding
What about possibility of multiple planets transiting at the same time? Will this also depend on the distances of the transiting object from Earth and to the star being observed?
"This only works when a planet's orbit around its sun happens to take it between the its sun and the earth. Most times, say 399 times in 400, this will not be the case."
we do not know the nature of reality
"She could have made her point in one or two sentences, but instead drones on to fill the TED time.  Ugh."
Stick this on Sci Fi channel
"Humans, and many other mammals, are not just ""sometimes even"" better than a computer at pattern recognition, they are the sine qua non of all the pattern recognition engines that we know of. Our neurons send signals at less than a millionth the speed of the signals that are sent in the innards of a computer's processors, so we can search much less by volume of data. Yet even in domains where have not been predisposed to it by evolution, we perform amazingly well in comparison to any computer system. 

If computers could feel pity, they might pity us for our slowness. If they could feel envy, they certainly would envy us for what we acheive in spite of it. I work in software, and I see and study the relative strengths and weaknesses between the two quite often. And while I am often dismayed by some things that our human brains are wont to do, I am also often amazed by what they are effortlessly capable of doing.

Computers and the software that directs them may at some point reach this level of sophistication, but there's a lot left to do to get there."
Its nazis
"Typical science, writing a paper and does not even have a clue. We humans are so stupid. And perhaps its just a moth that covered the eye .....but you're already see aliens. Nice joke"
"Arrogant ignorance.  Not one human from Earth has ever seen the entire universe so how the f*** do they know what could be ""the most mysterious,"" ""the most bizzare,""  the most any-damn-thing?!! Total bullshit."
"Perhaps it’s a massive pulsar and were aligned just off it’s pole, so the average brightness is actually the flare. And the dip in brightness is actually the mean brightness.

Does anyone know if they’ve done Gamma wave sampling?


I also think it quite statistically probable that in all the vastness of space one star has a “ring” or “rings” of planet sized masses orbiting it."
Hey somethings passed by the receptors of the satellite thats taking the data.
"I love the title; ""The most mysterious star in the universe | Tabetha Boyajian."" Well she's certainly weird"
"box is a 3D object (a form of prism), square is 2D. screen shows squares (a special form of a rectangle)"
"Ah, yes, and if you google the name of the star, it turns out that this year it was confirmed that it was, indeed, clouds of dust circling the star. A completely obvious explanation to the data that Tabetha dismissed as way too improbable. Pfffft."
Quotes Sagan saying that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Proceeds to make extraordinary claims with no evidence.
"""Yeah we actually have a valid hypothesis explaining the data, but never mind that, because get this- it's aliens."""
Idk seems a little far fetched since the earth is flat haha
God is amazing to give us a look.
"I haven't read much about the Dyson Sphere thing but wouldn't there be a resources issue? I mean how much material could be harvested from just one planet?  Just think about the surface area of a star compared to the total usable volume of a single planet. This would require resources from outside of that solar system. I say outside because anything disturbed within a single system would cause some major changes (probably catastrophic) in orbital paths due to mass fluctuation. Now, a civilization this advanced would have no issue bringing in resources from other systems BUT wouldn't somebody notice this traffic? I would check for activity of the nearest systems to this one. I think there may be something else happening but I am still curious to look into this matter."
"Computers can only look for data that the programmers think to tell it to look for.  They (currently) lack the human ""Huh, that's weird"" recognition ability.

Has the possibility been explored of there being multiple large gas giants in resonant orbits, and at least two of them co-orbiting (either as a binary planet, or in a dance like Janus and Epimetheus around Saturn)?"
Dust
the most mysterious explanation of nonsensible and outdated hypothesis including overexposed imigery.
there is no such thing as an unknown.... unlest yall y-/y'all just r ignrance- one true MJ?
Star in an asymmetric orbit around a black hole?
"Did I missed the part where they mentioned multiple planets, of different sizes and orbits, orbiting the star and lining up every once in awhile, and sometime forming some sort Olympic symbol?"
Show non cgi anything
"Man, I knew everything in this talk, and was even a part of this project online looking at the data. I was hoping I’d hear an explanation."
I guess this lady dropped D.M.T.
This was a load of nonsense and not worth making a TED talk about...
My first guess would be: A massive amount of planets. Like 20+ at least.
"What a great narration...Thank You, Imagine a Open Source projects with lot of resources and passionate crowd like Citizen Project...humanity can deliver best of the results we ever achive"
Probably we found first evidence of a Dyson Sphere being built by Alien Civilization...
"Not the computer's fault.
Data processing algorithms are too basic."
Or huge sun spots.
Celestial object KIC 8462852. A borg designation.
What type of software cannot catch a 20% drop in the light?
Wow
Black hole in an asymmetrical orbit and Doppler Effect?
"These idiots waste our tax dollars on hallucinating about distant stars.
You can only think about what you already know.
It could be something entirely different that would never accure to you.
The moon was NOT created by an impact.....
It is an artificial satellite that was created by the Pleiadians to seed the Earth with life.
And the moon has come from the Pleiads.
It is a huge spaceship.
And they will never show you what is on the fare side."
What about the gravitational wobble of the star?
Dumb lady.
"It looks almost like it could be an asteroid belt. That would explain the unnatural dips, the lack of an extra heat signature, pretty much everything."
Fafistacated?? 1:36
"This explained a lot about the confusing press I've read, thanks."
Its a fun hypothesis
"Why should the ""extraterestrial hypothesis"" be the ""last resort""?  Why is for example Velikovsky's theory about an ancient interplanetary war that destroyed a whole planet  and created the asteroid belt, so difficult for main stream science to accept?  I can give  only two explanations:  The ideology of linier progress and  the  phenomenologic  belief that Essense is above Hypostasis or Existense. (In other words the belief that history is more the product of some natural process than it is of people doing stuff)"
Really?!  I expect more from TED talks. Fansiful and wild speculation based on limited evidence.  Wouldn't an eliptical orbit and multiple moons of varying sizes cause this anomoly?  I think this a a very weak invocation of alien activity which rapidly decends into complete fantasy about an alien super structure.  When did science stop strutinising evidence to support a feasible hypothesis?
The sun is flat.
"since when has cgi & theory been evidence answer when it's nasa,s evidence that does nothing but back up it's  money train of theories"
"Laws of science and physics don’t always work in the vastness of space. The gravity of the star may have compressed dust and bits of ‘space trash’ into asymmetrical objects. They might not necessarily be planets, but they might be planet-y.

Anyways that is just a theory and I don’t know much about space so don’t kill me if somethings wrong;;. Aliens would be cool though!"
"A Dyson's sphere would not only consume mass energies in it's construction... it would most certainly have to consume most if not all of a star's planets and then some... if it had any at all.
The concept of Aliens building a Dyson's sphere is alomst as far fected as aliens using antimatter for fuel."
No one thought to consider a large planet with rings like Saturn orbiting the star?
I don't get why she went in that direction... like a dyson sphere arrangement would still be REGULAR... it's got to be clouds of something either there... or between here and there.
What about aliens would not be natural?
"A black hole orbiting the star could disrupt the star's output through tidal forces, especially if the black hole has an elliptical, eccentric orbit. The big 2011 dip could even be the event horizon itself transiting the star. The lensing effect would create a big distortion in the light reaching Kepler."
"I'm not saying it was aliens, but it was aliens!"
lame
theres more than 1 planet orbiting that star
"I don't think there are other aliens civilisations more advanced than earth's because most of the scientific advancement in earth was due to chance discoveries like X rays , antibiotics ete etc. The same chance cannot occur in other civilisations."
Is she Armenian?
"3:20 ""1,300 earth fits in jupiter."" why am i thinking there is a problem with this data? the contradiction!"
"It would be devastating if We discovered alien intelligence.
  search the fermi paradox and you’ll understand why"
Hahahaha.... The truth of the matter is that we dont have a god danged clue... Yep! Imagination is fun!!
"She calls naturalistic explanations ""Stupid Ideas,"" then dismisses them in favor of the extreme.  A Dyson's Sphere would require more than the mass of all the planets in orbit.  Farming materials from other star systems means they can travel to them, hence, they don't need a Dyson's Sphere.  But let's pretend."
"All the ""conclusions"" sound very weak if she doesn't explain how they can tell that a dip in luminosity is necessarily caused by a transit and not  the star itself."
I remember planet hunters from eve. Fun stuff got 99% success rate.
"Thargoids man, they are out there."
A year after this presentation studying archived material showed that the dimming of this particular star and not a single other one is going on/started  for about  a 100 years ago or so and getting dimmer and dimmer over time. That can be considered extraordinary evidence of a Dyson sphere in progress. All scientists agree that life must be present in the Universe but at the same time they're trying to deny any manifestation of it. WHY??
Clickbait
"""Reverse solar flares""?"
Is it possible that we are looking at a series of gas giants with large moon structures and an eccentric tilt with a ring system like saturn.? this would explain the size and A cemetery.
Why so many dislikes????.
10:16 i know what is dyson sphere!  I played stellaris.
"Seriously, are there still people who truly believe that 'aliens' do not exist? That the Earth has never been 'visited' by one or more extraterrestrial entity? That Kennedy was shot by a lone gunman? Or the twin towers was a terrorist plot and not the subject of a false flag op. to begin the military campaigns in the Middle East? (Play X-Files theme tune here)"
Easily one of the worst TED videos
"Who's said that those aliens using the same form of energy as we (electricity)? Same technology as we? By the way if we develop light based energy instead of electricity,  our life would be a lot easier and we dont have to kill mother earth..."
"In my point of view the question ""if"" there is life with the same level of intelligence or superior in comparison with humans, no longer poses.
It is obvious that there are beings on the same level or more evolved
just look at the civilizations on earth,
also where there are different levels of knowledge.
However I realize the following way that I will explain.
Let us place a Hydrogen atom on a scale compared to the size of a football stadium.
Can you see the size of the proton at its center?
Now imagine that the electron, of course, in its orbit around the proton, would be the boundary of the stage.
In the case of atoms this distance will always be respected.
I think other living beings in our galaxy have emerged in the galaxy to respect a law of nature as the distance relationship between the proton and its electron.
Maybe so that they do not annihilate one another, however once they evolve, maybe they find a way to communicate! Following the example of the atoms,
two species formed an intelligent molecule, until it completes its complexity and we have something like us in the cosmos.
However, and quite curious, the immensity of the universe and in fact we are stuck in the earth, for some reason there is this limitation for beings with our emotional and intelligent capacity.
We need to better understand the metaphysical to overcome the physical limits."
What if it is a black hole
"So, this is why this star is called Tabby's Star and WTF Star"
She has a slight lisp.
"1. The alient theory is valid
2. 100 times more probable is natural explanation, maybe planet with massive ring system?"
"SPOILER ALERT - they found nothing, and yet these people get paid more for sitting on a chair and just looking up the sky, a garbage man is worth more than her."
Won't fluctuations in the star also show up as such dips?
Why should alien hypothesis always be a last resort?
Could be an alien billboard? They block an awful lot of natural light here on planet Earth1
Scientist a figures out how to rob the labor of the masses to dresm about bs.
planetary collisions are the most likely thing to destroy planets
how do you know how far away from the star these transiting objects are?
5 mins in and I'm wondering is there massive fragments of smattered planets irregularly blocking the light
So it is more likely to be a Mega-structure built by Aliens than a massive dust cloud or thousands of comets passing by? lmao. NASA you are doing your job right.
Its the borg
"I just learned why Dyson vacuums have that little ball on them, cool. Also, why can't this be a field of mega asteroids orbiting very slowly around that star?   And, if it is aliens then what?"
"The truth is maybe that a spaceship is coming to our solar system.....and making sometimes shadows....
Hi will arrive in 1200 years......"
Borg evidence. Resistance is futile.

Lmao ok cut out the alien thing meaga structures? the biggest things humans have built are on a  microscopic level compared to space. If that was the case and they were super intelligent people of some sorts we would have come in contact. My thought on it could be a cluster of Jupiter sized planets bound together kinda of a mess of them grouped together frozen and very far from this light passing in front just a quick guess
Think the bigger point is everyone being able to be part of it and to show some excitement around it

That money should be used to educate people, eradicate poverty, investigate to cure diseases and to keep this planet in good condition, after all, if we take care of this planet, there would be no need to try to colonize other planets."
morse code from alien civilizations
It was to detect earth like planets in stars but ended hypothesizing second level civilizations.   I bet all these citizen scientist are paranoid schizophrenics with a zealous advocacy for obtuse scientifically flawed alien theories.   The camera is simply not sensible enough to detect such fanfare of this citizen star hunt (alien hunt really).

alien ≠ aliens
The object is huge and it travels around its star in a opal shape instead of circular motion like earth does to go around the Sun. It travels faster around the sides of its star then travels away further toward our observation thus making the dip last longer and give hiccup dips as its rotation slowdown at furthest point of the opal toward us and then starts to pick up speed in its return to go around its star again. Just because our solar system is in perfect rotation around the Sun gravity doesn’t mean everything else in the universe has perfect gravitational rotations.
Claims Require Evidence
"I don't believe she has a clue has to what she was talking about. Most extraterrestrials are 20 - 200% greater in their advancement than us, this implies that such a mega structure would not produce heat.


Also, SETI is a distraction. Extraterrestrials already visit the planet continually everyday."

Why would Aliens pour huge resources into constructing a Dyson Sphere when its much more efficient in time/cost/effort to use limitless zero point energy.
Conjecture and no PROOF - most of these people get paid high fees to talk bullshit with NO EVIDENCE ..........
Very interesting stuff. I hope they find the real origin of that signal. The lady astronomer really needs some clothing advice though. :-)
👽
"“citizen scientists” is an even more cringeworthy term than citizen journalists. scientist shouldn’t require a modifier. if you’re a citizen scientist, you’re not a scientist."
"If this alien civilisation’s planet is so fucked, how would it even have enough natural resources to build a Dyson sphere so insanely huge? This talk went so far south when she moved from science to science fiction."
Dark Matter?
So an alien civilization has run out of energy and in order to get more they have built a megastructure to harvest it. How much energy would it have taken to build a megastructure like that? Not an explanation I find reasonable.
"Look at how far we as a species have progressed in knowledge in the past 5000 years, now fast forward another 500 years, yes 10% longer. Assuming we do not destroy ourselves or create a world too hostile to live on, just imagine where humans will be."
Rubbish like this will destroy science.

"Say - maybe they blew the planet to bits then used the debris to build a section of the Dyson sphere??? I'm thinking the construction process must be completely automated. The organic element of the civ may have atrophied on a terminal decline once they made the Ai, or become enhanced/merged with the machine - eek, it's the Borg!!!"
These days so called 'scientist' are not making any mathematical statements. They are just getting paid huge salaries (from tax payers) and writes fairy tales.

"What if the light source is not a star? what if it's some thing we haven't discovered yet, something that fluctuates?"
Couldn't it be an exoplanet orbiting a much nearer star which happens to transit the more distant star????????????
"Very interesting. Nice to see humans capable and willing to do this. I see some serious limitation when considering the options. For example, I do not agree with the assumption that an advanced species must have exhausted its planetary supplies. That would not be very advanced thinking, irrelevant of the state of their technology, and suggestive of a potential weakness if ever we engage in conflict. At least here, we may still compete. Theories are good, now test it rigorously, and dismiss the fairtytales. Otherwise, how about a Death Star broken in 2 separate pieces, post-Skywalker? The available data would suggest a mega laser cut. In that case, George Lucas was not a dreamer but a remote viewer but he didnt see the ending well."
"yup ok so if i believe it you can tell me more ?how much money you want now like who really gives a crap about what you can make out thru that telescope,it is only a telescope not a magic crystal ball the only magic is when you believe the lie and your time energy and money disappears"
"i give her about a C.......  shes reaching quite a bit with the mega structure..  i mean the distance and amount of material needed to make a object 1000x the earth size rotate around a star  would be about the mass of lets say 1000x the earth.  and if u can refine that much material  i dont think ud have energy problems..   it could easily and most likely be a few planets that rotate around and easily align every so often and create the fluctuations..  theres no way it can be comets ,,,  comets have solar system wide orbits  thats what makes it a comet..  you wouldnt see a comet go that fast around the sun in such a short orbit and having thousands to create it that way is just to much of  a reach"
nothing more than a guess !
Your data is off. That's the only possibility.  Lol

what about a huge celestial body with dense offset rings??
That's a lot of imagination without any superproof evidence....what she said doesn't make much sense...
I think people need to search this planet fully before we look out into the stars.
"Like other comments on here my bet is an orbiting mini system like Jupiter, with the new discoveries of unexpected phenomena like hot Jupiter, who's to say what may form around stars, perhaps 2 Jupiter sized plants locked in orbit with earth sized moons"
"It doesent need to be close to that star which is shading it, could be some other anomaly. Also if there is alien structure, why they would spend so much materials to gain solar power if they are so much advanced in technology? Sounds so uneffective."
Wtf??
where's the flux kinda crazy speculation.... astronomers are a breed of their own.
"Sooooo, am I the only one thinking that maybe there's more than one planet around that star, and perhaps two of them passed by each other in our line of sight.  Maybe they are large or slightly out of alignment (one a bit higher than the other so to speak).   Maybe the smaller dips are smaller planets cruising by.  That's a bit more logical explanation than aliens and Dyson Spheres."
How about several plants at the same time or brown dwarfs? With moons?
"I thought for sure she was going to share what the final, natural explanation was... instead, we have a cliffhanger!
Very interesting..."
"Type in: Sono Luminience - Star in a jar., The real stars.,Admiral Byrd south pole expedition.  enjoy"
thats all ok but why not to put the same energy to solve Earthy problems just before your nose?
"awesome, love this...but alien structure would produce a pattern , but as far as i saw in this video it was random, and slope was changing slow when brightness goes down but rapid change when goes up, well their structure could be spinning fast, but if they live on that structure, it'll simply change the artificial gravity"
Seems very easily explained by asteroids passing in between us & the star & the asteroids being much closer to us.  Thus a .001% dip would show up as 10% & 20%. Don't they have the corresponding synced visual images to go along with the numerical data?  A visual snapshot taken at the moment the data was collected would reveal if there is an object in between the lens and the star at the moment of the data reading.
we hardly know ANYTHING of reality ... SO that ANY claim sounds ultimately ridiculous. A scientific egoic manifestation so huge it is bashful ..

Why don't you just ask the star?
So you find aliens. Now what? Inside a couple of weeks everybody will be bored and off on another conspiracy theory.
"Fascinating and a great speech and approach to the phenomenon...   my thought is that they probably witnessed a variety of planets coming into alignment at different frequency to cause all of the various light dips.   Some of the planets could be giant, there could be dozens or hundreds of planets, or both.   Maybe the planets are orbiting in some sort of alignment we've never seen before?   There clearly needs to be focus and much more data produced to unravel this mystery.   Probably going to take many many years to establish patterns that will produce reliable data."
"How about the star itself is changing it's light output, like a variable star?  Much more plausibe."
"A lot of people are blaming the lack of funding to explore our surroundings on capitalism. No. You either have a government that funds the space program or it doesn't. The government our ancestors created is supposed to find safe, new opportunities for the entirety of the country.

The problem is, is that the idiots in government are being voted in to think short term based upon the interests of corrupt investors."
What a great fluid presentation!
It’s the Empire’s Deathstar!
get a proper job
An astronomer once explained the transit method like looking for a mosquito in front of a light house four kilometers away. That really gave me some perspective.
The data were good? Doesn’t get much more uneducated than that.
"What a disgustingly slurred English that is... Unbearable! I can't take somebody seriously, who speaks with a thick accent. And then always this ear-piercing pitch to produce their overexaggerated, artificial enthusiasm. Why are US-women so broadly convinced that this faked excitement appears sincere to us? She sounds like a sensation-seeking TV-presenter, but not like a scientist."
What if a planet careened into this star. It cooled various parts of its surface that causes various dips in luminosity.
IT'S HALO
What if it is a black hole going around the sun? Or a group of planets that aligned in a weird way?
Wouldn't a planet with its own moon(s) rotating around it account for the asymmetrical dip?
"It was the deathstar! THE SITH ARE COMING, WE ARE ALL GONNA DIE!!! RUN LUKE RUN!!!😨"
Or an Alien parked it's space ship and put on hazard lights and left it there after been picked by another ship that's the light they're seeing these NASA people
"If I remember correctly in school we were taught that stars are soooo far away that the blinking lights from the stars we see in our skies at night, they may be long dead stars and no longer there. We just see light that has traveled for millions of years to get to us it's just that it hasn't faded away and we have scopes staring at something that no longer exists,  just saying but it can be hilarious if this is so true 😂🤣"
"The real reason that the NASA budget was cut ... they have other technology ... do you realize how many people are killed for inventing Free Energy Technologies, or cures to Cancer ??

NASA is involved so we know it's fake.
Is she pregnant ?
you should check out sam hyde's ted talk about 2070 and his predictions.
U implemented this into eve online    as well. Lots of help from gamers.
it could be an object that behaves like a red dwarf sun spots that can dim it and solar flares that make it brighter except this star would just have huge sun spots
"""with the help of Science enthusiasts""  because only people who go to uni are scientists??"
love how there are a bunch of expert astronomers here that know what is really up with the mysterious star. Youtube is the new Science journals of our time...
"""I will let you work out the acronym""
Shows the acronym"
A woman lol
"well it could be a not-so big object (or structure) passing by very far away from the actual star and blocking the light, right ? not something actually in the sistem. So a smaller object could block a much larger amount of light than it would being near the star"
"Actually, blowing up a planet would make it rather easy to mine that planet's core metals, using large magnetic fields to collect a lot of the smaller and easier to process materials would prevent large and unsafe dust plumes and reduce what is seen. Add that there would be a ton of construction then you could get more anomalies."
"The Dyson sphere is the stupidest explanation that they could have said about this. Why the object blocking the light of the star has to be a planet? or even in the same system, look at our solar system from far away and the objects on the Kuiper belt will block the light of the Sun in a similar manner, irregular and huge because of the distance from the Sun. These guys probably haven't heard the expression that you can block the sun with one finger. The farther away the objects the more light they will block, and it could be another system with planets going around a star so dim that it can't be detected just next to that one KIC 84 system."
What a load of crap.

But yeah this is the Most interesting thing in Space right now..."
"Nice thought, hope you have conclusively ruled out all possibilities in your computer simulations including a few planets revolving around each other with dust, spinning around each other and orbiting this star. I am sure one day an 'amateur' astronomer will discover something amazing, perhaps your team already has, a few more investigations (next months/ few years from now) will reveal the nature, even before interplanetary travel, as some suggest."
ARGUMENT FROM IGNORANCE
The amount of resources needed to partially surround a star would be massively more material than the mass of the planet producing the dyson sphere

the mega-structure would be easy to have all the materials if they mine an asteroid they'd have all its elements they will have enough material to build that easily we're going to do that as well in 10years from now come back and like my comment for being right with Elon Musk wanting to mine space with AI robots  they're build solely to mine space for elements don't make them too smart just make them human-level smart that way they don't take over how lower life-forms if you make an AI too smart they will see us like dumb animals that can't speak only speaks its own language how humans think of dogs if an artificial intelligence has a singularity they'll be like the chess player that never loses manipulating the world into tricking humans the AI build smarter better technology the human beings creating Sophie the AI from Hong Kong there artificial intelligence are dangerous they're always talking about how they're going to destroy the world I made a video clip of them go watch my video
It seems to me that one way to communicate interstellar distances would be to block the light from your star by a significantly noticeable percentage in a way that you could toggle on an off. So say you have a smart material that was thin but strong and you could build it large enough to cover that 1% zone astronomers are watching for. And you could toggle it at will between transparency and opaqueness.  You could position it between a star and a promising system and let your star send a message.

ted seems lost
This video might be less boring if she spiked her hair out and said ‘Aliens!’
Weak ending... too bad.
"When the final history books are written on human civilization, it will sadly document how we spent billions studying celestial bodies we'll never get to while our brothers and sisters starved to death in the streets.  Even if we figured out how to travel twice the speed of light, which we won't, and we found a way to survive long periods in space, which we can't, we'd still hope to get there in billions of years.  Give it up and lets solve our problems here first.  Anyone debating this watched too much Star Trek and Star Wars, which are fiction, not fact."

Probably just dust https://www.space.com/38363-alien-megastructure-tabbys-star-dust.html
"It’s amazing that people on YouTube can not grasp the amazing ness of this discovery. I’ve read all the comments saying “oh just collision of planets” or “oh just debris.”

She then explains why it can’t just be a collision or debris. 

Other people say “oh just comets” and she explains why it’s not comets.

She is a scientist and talking about all the other scientists who poured over the data and who all agreed that this is not planets, debris or comets. But YouTube commenters think they know more than hundreds of scientists who all have access to the data.

She then introduced the idea of Keplers alien civilization requirements and the idea that Dyson spheres was what some people took and ran with. 

She then says that they did not observe heat so it can’t be a Dyson sphere. 

She then said that she observed a space battle but said why she is bringing up aliens. 

The whole point at the end was that it could be a natural phenomenon but could be aliens but that she is betting on natural phenomenon. 

The fact that I have to explain this just goes to show what dipshit the average youtuber is. Why can’t people just enjoy the goddamn video? I’m always watching scientists speculating about string theory and creatures from other dimensions. Everyone understands it’s speculative. But one chick gets on a video and grrrr here come all the haters."

Goodnessakes we can't even get it right on earth why look at anything else ?? dumbass people
"Wonder if these people took trig or geometry in school? You can't tell what size a planet is without knowing how far away it is from its star. Double the distance = quadruple the area blocked. Also placing too much value in photons (e.g. assuming their path to have been unaltered) that are thousands or millions of years old is nonsense. This is what you get when people ""f***ing LOVE science!"" but they don't understand it."
the data were good though
"One thing is clear, we as humans don't understand anything and only propose theories and hypothesis about universe. And adamant with our knowledge in physics."
many large planets explains this
You forgot one other goofy idea a planet Harvester they plan at Harvester would have to be freaking huge in a race of aliens LOL that would be able to build a planet Harvester would be on the move
"Correct me if I’m wrong, but could the anomalies in the observations occur due to a large heavenly body orbiting the star at a huge distance. (relative to normal orbital distances) This would imply that the planet would “appear” to be large, and “appear” to block a lot of light.  Plus, it would be far away and thus orbit slowly, resulting in the observed prolonged periods of dimness."
"If the Alien's Planet is running low on resourses, where did they get the resourses to build these Mega Stuctures?  Why one enormous one; why not several smaller structures? May I suggest Solar Panels, Windmills on their own Planet.

"Very large planet with many moons; a recently destroyed planet; planets/moons/celestial body combination and or alignment; a planet shaped like a disc (similar to flat earth theory OR possibly the result of being destroyed making this theory 2, however, I don't rule out the possibility of OTHER planets possibly being a disc shaped)"
By wearing the VSD ( Variable Size Dress) TB wants to demonstrate  the effect of an orbiting alien solar panel witch can be folded and unfolded depending on the energy needs of that civilization !
"Hope in the end , they will not find that something small passed right in the front of the camera of the satelite causing this ...lol"
Personally as an amature scientist my money is on the truth whatever that may be.   Forget about spechulation and get more data.  Like many scintific lectures no concluion was reached. They're hoping some day smebody can reach a concluision with proof.
To build a dyson sphere wouldn't they need more refined metals than a single panet can provide?
Could this be evidence of a lrarge planet with several moons?
Wow. Science has become very unscientific.
aliens are natural
Keep trying guys. Unexplained phenomena that we have no way of verifying the source of THEREFORE ALIENS. Has everyone forgotten about Quasars?
"The earth and moon never have bean in a collision. You waste your brain power and my time.
Yah spoke it, and it was done., please stop saying lies about the universe. I am sick of hearing it."
"The problem with the dyson sphere in my opinion is, where do you get ALL the raw material to build a cage around a star? I have not done that math but I don't think that earth would have enough raw material to build something like that. unless its nanometer thin but even then I don't know, maybe they used other WHOLE planets to build it?"
perhaps it was a rogue planet coming between Kepler and the star..
And people wonder why I roll my eyes back into my head when they start talking about their science. Science is not necessary to believe in ... it's science. The proving of  stuff!!! Not the guessing of wildly religious ideas
earth moon event? At best a vague therory
.... is of course _me_ .
The most terrible blouse I ever saw!
"this is amazing.. but until we can actual travel to the system, it is all speculation.... it would be even more amazing to actual see the cause..."
"Scientists are acting like idiots ... the light output is changing because all stars dont act the same. The methodology is stupid, stars are electric."
"Could it not be just a system of several big planets (rotating around each other) passing by their star? Each time their co-positions can be slightly different, because the different rotation periods."
"Not ""mysterious "" to Electric Universe scientists."
These structures are enormous....but they do not in all probability exist
Protoplanetary disc?
"ANOTHER star, yawn (so rare, stars"
"I'm not a scientist, but can’t the dips be the result of a chain of planets?  The first slightly erratic one could be a gradual alignment happening, the smooth dip the perfect alignment of them, and the massive amount of random erratic dips the after effect of each individual planet crossing the star's light path to us."
Why push for conclusions when you don’t know for sure. There’s nothing wrong with admitting “WE DON’T KNOW”.
"Seems a bit irresponsible to not try to focus on astrophysical explanations of the data, rather than jump to ""alien-structure"" theory. However of course one gets more media attention to the other, so a case of ""lets run with this"" for whatever reason."
COD'S WALLOP!
"And now that we've found these aliens building earthly dyson spheres to solve earthly over-consumption issues, let's ping them using morse code laser. I'm sure they're just like us."
and how much of my tax dollars are going to these quacks?
"Interesting start, but turned into pseudo-scientific sensationalism. That trend unfortunately became very popular."
So the Keppler telescope is ultimately perfect tool which cannot make any mistake in collecting data - like a tiny flux. are you sure that absolutely nothing is flying nearby the telescope? Not even a single piece of dust? - Okham Razor will help you a lot.
where does an alien civilization get all the material to build a dyson sphere.  Stars are orders of magnitude larger than planets.  It would take several thousand planets at least to make a dyson sphere.
Can it be moving at an erractic speed plus some other combintion?
That was pretty cool
"Worst reach for interesting material ever...no science so lets just write a hollywood cgi explanation....TED, u suck"
What would a parade of planets look then?
"0:14 this stupid quote just means that we should submit to our biases. Because ""extraordinary"" is just a bias."
"I have the answer, it is the Tesla car that spaceX launched."
Damn! I shouldn't have taken my spacecraft in b/w this puny blue planet and this star.
"The idea that comes to mind for me is something is passing through space in generally our direction, be it natural or not. It's not that it's enormous, it's that its blocking more light than expected because of perspective."
Why can't it be a black hole passing by?
"If it is aliens, then we're not so special and there's a great filter waiting for us."
Have you consider objects blocking telescope view from here to the object?
"Doesn't matter what it is, no matter how ridiculous your alien theory is. People will destroy each other before we will be able to fix anything."
Total BS
"1. It's an abbreviation, not an acronym. 2. There's something in space that blocks light. 3. If they can construct Dyson spheres, they may also have some technology for dealing with the heat.  Finally, there is something so far away we can only detect it due to the light that manages to reach us through untold and unimagined depths of the interstellar medium.  Really big news: we don't know what it is. Dear God, it's like kids playing in a laboratory lol."
Is that Elizabeth Holmes from Theranos infamy in the audience @ 1:35?
Hello everyone. I live in Sydney... Australia. I need a Scientist to contact me. I know how the Universe was formed before and after.  I know about The Fourth Dimension. About Light Speed... Warp Speed... Hypar - Speed...Hyper Speed.  Worm Holes. I will put most in writing in a few months.  as for the planet with shadow.  It could be an Invasion Fleet.
I just love listening to humans trying to explain the universe. Kinda like a newborn trying to explain where she was yesterday.
"Wouldnt it be possible, for a Sattelite or something orbiting closer to earth to block the stars light? It could also be a coincidence that two planets just happen to be aligned with each other, as they pass the star. Much like when mars and earth align. If they would be slighly off and not perfectly aligned, it would also give an inconsistent form and appear pretty huge."
I could listen to her for ages. Very knowledgeable.
I hope not all scientist are that boring and without sense of humor
Maybe the aliens were blinking their star to communicate like Morse code. ?)
"I wish Dysonpher was in the title so I could’ve saved myself some time. I have so many problems with this, I don’t know where to start."
Amazing to be the first to see a DYSONSPHERE!!! Still can’t believe this is happening!!!!
She’s pretty
"Given so many stars have a companion star, it would not surprise me that a companion star's planets are eclipsing the planet at times. Especially given that some stars are already dark."
you all witnessed a giant planet multi moon eclipse. It is that simple
Might just be some massive sized asteroid
How much difference in light can be recorded if a star is experiencing massive dark spots on her surface?
"I feel for her ending and conclusion, must be like reading the results and recommendations of that journal article."
She has ajob..sad..total screwball...
She's wrong. Its a huge planet with a bunch off moons..
So basically science is a bunch of people playing guessing games with things that can never be proven. Got it.
"No proof of anything. Only  her justifying a wasted budget.Come on Nasa, at least give us some cgi  like you usually do.Ted talks=science fiction"
Interesting..
Planetary alignment? Lol? Its not 1 but several lining up to cause the gradual dip and just happen to gracefully bow out around the same time. Until their alignment falls out of sync and you get the last light curve data format which is the planets simply not being lined up as perfectly...?
"Has no one head of multiple planets orbiting a star? Different speeds for each orbit and the rare alinement would cause these irregular readings, could also be up to 100 planets orbiting the one star and we simply haven't kept the mission up long enough to find the pattern"
What if the object is just closer to Kepler and is moving very slow?
She is fun..
NASA Never A STRAIGHT Answer
"IS THIS PLANET RELATED TO PLANET X,,,GLOBAL WARMING,,,THE  POLE-SHIFT,,,AN OTHER THINGS RELATED TO THIS PLANET WE LIVE ON...."
It was probably just a sun spot
It's a monolith
My money is on hardware failure - in particular the outputs got wonky right at the end of the mission leaving no time to troubleshoot.
Yeah aliens..... or asteroids in lagrange points around  a giant  gas planet.
i feel like it’s a solar system
This is dated. This star is just looking exceptionally dusty.
"She's correct about alien hypotheses as a LAST resort.
If American taxpayers knew the staggering amount of public money spent to-this-day on ""exobiology"" they would demand it stop immediately.
Example, Mars. Exactly how many missions are required to demonstrate there is no life there? Yet they see themselves differently from how many explorations are needed to disprove Bigfoot? Because they're NASA? 
Those who say it's public money well spent need to spend a bit of time in developing countries, inner city Detroit, a public hospital and food bank."
Stupid bitcheh
You can tell she knows the truth but has to be hush mouth and skeptical
WELCOME TO THE FRACTAL FREEWAY.... XOXO ... ⭐️😽💋💋💋💋💋

"We are so tiny, this universe is a small part of God's brain."
"A woman presented this, I just tuned out"
bish whatt???
Is this Ted talk serious? I thought they have professionals... it’s clearly a black hole orbiting it. The only thing that is that big and could cause such anomalies that we think the laws of physics are being broken.
"What if it's an normal object, but far from the star, so it produces this huge shadow?"
She is awesome!
Haa thor making his storm breaker😂
Wtf.
"Me when even if it were alien megastructures shrouding the star’s light, it’d be potentially millions of years old and if they’re anything like humans they’ve probably killed themselves by now"
"Sure, why go with a realistic asteroid explanation when you can make up a ludicrous alien story. if you search for explanations, take the more simple ones and not the ones which need lots of imagination. that is not scientific."
The earth and universe was so fine until people start studying it.
"Since the dip in the light is increasing over the years, what if the dip is due to an gynormous asteroid or planet which just escaped the gravity of the Star which the Kepler is pointed at !!!"
RA 1h 33m 50s | Dec +30° 39′ 37″
What if the star has planet and planet has moon?
"Hmmm, bit of a stretch"
The data were good 6:07
What if it’s just a series of planets in orbit and some planets are closer to us than others and they line up directly between us and the star
Could have been a meteorite traveling toward the Keplar that prevented light
THIS IS BULLSHIT IT MEANS NOTHING
Fuckin aliens! I knew it...
"Humans are so awesome. 
We have such enormous potential."
"The ""Krypton"" Theory and the  ""Death Star"" Theory lol"
Searching for the special planets and stars meanwhile we destroy the one who is most special and important to us =)
She really looks serious when talking about space wars... XD
Dust. It was dust.
"I still find it funny that we consider ourselves 'intelegent life'.

As a species we are extremely unproductive and self destructive, yet somehow consider ourselves intelegent. 

We use up resources faster than they can be replaced and purposely destroy resources. Everyone's always bitching about climate change and temperatures. What about drinkable water and fertile soil. 

We have overpopulated to stupid extremes. People living in areas below sea level that get shocked when it floods. People living in areas with no source of vital resources (water) and then it becomes everyone else's fault for their stupid choices. Ex: draughts in Africa or native Americans in Canada, both in areas without water and they still stay there. 

What next, people choosing to live nude in Antarctica and complain that it's cold?

We are by far not an intelegent species. Survival of the first ended long ago, keeping the less fit alive served a purpose for assisting the 'top dogs', but we've exceeded the limits and the mutts have taken control. Now all our species cares about are pointless feelings and media."
"What a load of total bollocks. Are we to believe that a phenomenon that is complex and mysterious can be explained by the total crap expounded by a group of people who get paid for guessing , and only guessing? For me, that’s not science but the best job in the world. Shameful!"
"I love how all astronomers, no matter what their actual age is, are so jubilantly young at heart."
"Could that ""mysterious"" fenomenon not just have been a casual planetary alignement or a planetary/multiple-moon alignment or some equivalent of the Kuiper Belt? 
I find these kind of wanabe-popular-scientists, jumping too fast to conclusions, speculating on too little and insufficient data,  rallying a  druwling crowd way too happy to validate and affirm their invented claim and celeb status, pretty annoying!
WTFlux!!"
This video is epitome of TED shittiness. Physicists pls don't watch.
Interesting...but what a horrible shirt. Like wearing a trash bag
I thought the most mysterious star was Shia LAbOUF
Watching these kind of videos only makes me lose respect for certain types of scientists who it seems must guess and use their imaginations allot more than they are admitting to.
"I was thinking that maybe sun spots could account for the variance of light? Who knows how big they can get, nor how long they might last."
what if a fucking planet from another fucking solar system gol in between the star light and us. obviously would look like something fucking huge was blocking that star visibility
"There you have it folks, science at its best."
Earth is just eleven times smaller than jupiter? I don't think so.
"Whatever explanation they come up with will probably be wrong! This is what ""scientists"" do; they find something; they find it here, they find it there, they find it anywhere, then they make up a bunch of stuff about it, a whole scenario, when, in fact, they have no idea!"
Aliens are all over the place . They don't want to talk to us because we will wipe out our whole planet with the idiots running around on it with the info they might give us !
The irregularity is due to the partially completed Death Star. see the irregular entry and smooth exit?
Recently it is found  to be clouds of dust orbiting the star
This just makes me wanna play Stellaris
"I don’t understand people fascination with the proposal of a ‘dyson sphere’. You’re not thinking, where would you get the material? Enough to wrap around a star and withstand the copious radiation which would effect the devices actually extracting the energy and the heat which would MELT almost every material that close to it"
"The alien theory the go with is a dyson sphere? A dyson sphere would give consistent data as it orbits though. They just had one giant thing slow down and then speed up and never return. They never received that data again, not for a single year. I'm so confused why they think that's the same thing passing by the planet with how incredibly different the charts are for every year that anything shows up. That one freaky decelerating and then accelerating object is gone.

If it were comets you could measure a time frame, see how much light is blocked, compare it to different time frames, and find the averages. Because of how empty most of the years are, I doubt the comet theory - where did all those congregating comets go that happened to be flying together for just one year? C'mon. 

Her face goes chromagnon when she says ""As a scientist, I have to say, my money is on the natural theory."" Trouble is your natural theory is just as imaginary as the life theory - you don't know what it is either way, why place bets on what you're imagining entirely?

Besides, life IS natural..."
"New observation in the beginning of 2018: http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/new-observations-mysterious-star-boyajian/

Unfortunately alien megastructures seem less likely to be the cause according to new data."
A remarkably intriguing talk. I really enjoyed the pace and her enthusiasm!
She sounds delusional
"Fascinating, Has there been any more news on this discovery since the talk was published?"
"So, it happens every 2 years but we are witnessing the same event over and over...

This was a huge waste of time.  Unfortunately, also a huge waste of money."
It could just be an abnormally shaped rock out in our oort cloud
"Most likely just big planets orbiting each other. And this ""astronomer"" starts talking about aliens right away..."
"Kind of funny that I've found this just now. Just handed in my Masters dissertation and preparing for my viva on my project, which was creating a program to scan through Kepler data that had been missed by previous programs when looking for certain types of stars!"
"Oh so this is who ""Tabby"" is."
Another J K Rowling in the making. Only the new one has a PhD in astrophysics I guess
"I absolutely love how even the smartest of the people criticize  ""computers"" . Computer is just a tool, the output depends on the skill of a programer and qualification of a user , even an artificial intelligence needs to be trained to recognize the right answer . Instead of putting countless human hours into going through the data it might be more productive to invest it into defining the proper computer algorithm."
https://youtu.be/BzaXgvCjB0M
Dyson swarms/spheres etc. are extremely poor uses of resources.
"First, there is no such thing as ""extraordinary evidence."" This is an intellectualist parlor claim. 
Secondly, as a scientist you should never classify explanations based on politics. In other words, why should one state, use alien explanations as the last resort? That proves, again, same as the Smithsonian and most academic institutions, TED too is under control by those who control the distribution of information. 
Last but not the least look for the YouTube videos where other scientists not affiliated with government controlled institutions present evidence this is not a natural structure and that this is a man-made megastructure. (Search for Tabby's Star)"
My hypothesis is that a large collection of planetary bodies in close proximity to each other and move in irregular formations.
The very important turn is that we are learning how integrate human skills and tech data!
"When a Billionaire, who has spend millions investigating the ET Presence alongside the Defence Intelligence Agency (DIA) and he then says ""They are here, right user our noses"", you should sit up and listen.............Look into Robert Bigelow. He is a national hero."
it as been confirmed that it is just space dust
My question is are we still looking at this Star to see if we see a pattern over time?
Its a Borg Uni-matrix!!
"The simplest explanation is usually the right one..   It's just an extra large planet on a very slow orbit due to it's mass.
Large planets also tend to have a great number of moons orbiting them, which would account for the other anomalies."
"Bad title; should be ""The most mysterious star in the galaxy""  - which is still hyperbole."
This is incredibly dumb.  Real astronomy seems just as batty and speculative as the average conspiracy video on YouTube.
Well...I think it's alien
http://innerawakening.org
"There's another option with the aliens, one that makes sense with the data. If you had a large ship, that gradually got farther away from the star, it would produce larger and larger dips in the brightness. Except a reason is needed, if said hypothetical ship was shattered in it's orbit, combat or collision, the pieces would most likely create the odd data, with each large dip in brightness being another large piece. While it was difficult to see in the video, it appeared that the spaces gradually were farther apart, which gives some plausibility to the gradually increasing orbit idea."
"Why isn't a black hole one of the proposed causes? I.e. a star transitting behind a black hole. Seems like a star orbiting a black hole would result in the increased magnitude in the drop of the light curve as the black hole increases size. Additionally, it seems it would be possible that other objects pulled into the black hole's orbit would occasionally and unpredictably ""transit"" the star resulting in the multiple drops in the light curve happening close together."
Could it just be simple distant planet with his moon
"Nothing to see here guys, it was just a bit off dust: https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/3/16843678/alien-megastructure-tabbys-star-kic-8462852-dust"
Simply multiple off-axis planetary orbits. ... Sorry I didn't find this topic sooner to share the correct reason.
"Just wow, very good job"
Could it be a partial Dyson Sphere? or just Dark Matter? Could it just be a big star forming where it has not yet reached critical mass?
"Look at the great void, for a long time we thought it was an empty piece of space, but it's actually just a large nebula in our way that looks black. Anything between here and there can cause the dip, maybe it's a black hole distorting the light from that one star, or a group of asteroids close to us passing though our view"
an armada?
DUST IN THE WIND
so fucking sick of these female pseudo scientists
Bi solar system you stupid
Spent 15 minutes leaning a whole lot of nothing...
Could there not be multiple planets?
Could something pass through the distance between Kepler and star? Why does it have to be around the star as you think.how many miles between Kepler and star?
Did she just say Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter?
It's serendipity my friend.

"God is real and he gives clear instruction on how to prove it. If you are looking to the stars you wont find it (if you are a skeptic).

Wormholes?
Fight of space ships!!
could it simply be that there are multiple planets that at times are close enough in orbits to appear as one mass
Sun spots?
"Based on the amounts of time, energy, and money, how many useful new technologies in the past 10 years have astronomers created? 
Most of what she talked about was useless noisy opinions.
""We need to continue to...."" = more tax dollars to make more useless noisy opinions."
it would take 10s of planets worth of recources to achieve this kind of technology. we would most likely need to destroy all the planets in our solar system to get these recourses...
I wish science would stop playing to the non-scientist crowd.
"Going alien is just lame.  Fun, but not scientific.  The comet explanation isn't bad.  Just remember that truth is stranger than fiction, when they find it it will be interesting."
"When scientists give so much air time and debate to the alien civilisation hypothesis, based on the postulated effects of a (postulated) unimaginably massive alien-constructed mega structures, there is a strong sense of intellectual fraud. We see here the juxtaposition of the highly unlikely existence of alien life and the highly unlikely existence of mega structures so massive that they create observable dips in the star light seen almost 1,300 light years away. This is not wishful thinking or pandering to the fantasies of the general public, it goes way beyond that. It makes you question the integrity of those who repeat this hypothesis over and over again. The giveaway is the juxtaposition of three assumptions with no factual basis and that are exceedingly unlikely. So we see multiple graphical representation of planets surrounded by hypothesised megastructures, speculations on what these megastructures might look like close up etc, instead of a focus on natural explanations. If this is the level of intellectual rigour that is being applied to the alien megastructure hypothesis, what level of rigour is being applied to finding natural explanations? This kind of garbage thinking damages space exploration."
What if there were many planets orbiting the star which can caise such kind of dip in the brightness.what if two three or more plantes passed in front of the star which is why there is Un even graph of that brightness.
"""As a scientist my money is on natural phenomenon "". You're not a scientist unless you can't imagine"
How about giant cold spots on the star that are not linear?
How about more than one planet moving arount the star
Lol Nasa once again making everyone think about something which doesnt even exist
"What's the strange about it?  It might be having bunch of planets around it like our sun.  At one time one planet might be blocking and  some other times four or five planets might be blocking...! or it might be having planets far away from it.  So, they can block considerably from our view..."
What about a distortion in space time
It was the empire building it’s Death Star.

Find it funny a comet swarm is contrived but alien mega structures are not. Just because you have a PhD doesn't prevent you from clueless.
Esas anomalias Son las lunas de los planetas.
"It can be possible that more than one planet is crossing the star which explains irregular dips and non symmetric objects, which is natural rather than some alien civilization or whatever.."
"I guess when you really really really really really REALLY want to believe in aliens, that must be what is true."
"1,480 LY = 540,200,000 EARTH DAYS"

Guys!!! it's obviously a Gauna.
It turns out the most likely cause is just dust
I think they found a star with lots of planets their explanation way out there
The most mysterious star in the universe up to date
In the observable universe.
"If this was due to alien, it would definitely be mind blowing, however: ""Researchers found less dimming in the infrared light from the star than in its ultraviolet light. Any object larger than dust particles would dim all wavelengths of light equally when passing in front of Tabby's Star."" — NASA, 4 October 2017. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KIC_8462852). 

This seems to rule out aliens."
Boring! Please get to the point!
Utter bollocks.
Isnt it possible that an object closer to Kepler was blocking the light from the star? A spec of dust close enough to Kepler can block sufficient precentage of the light from the star... Is it more sensible to believe an alien structure 1000 times bigger then earth is there? I think its laughable.
Fake news
so what was it than?
Just a thought - elliptical orbits and system of planets.  Huh? kind of like our own solar system...
"ugh, worst TED ever......... Said Comic book man...."
"What do we know about the stellar wind this star produces...??? And assuming this star periodically produces extreme stellar winds, what effects would that have on possible planets rotating closely to this particular star...??? My guess would be that what we are witnessing are the 'infant years' of the planets rotating around this star and that these planets will slowly migrate outward in their solar system. The extreme stellar winds (or solar winds) this star occasionally produces, blows gas and dust particals away from the nearby rotating planets and this material will ultimately form a ring similar to our Asteroid Ring, Kuijper Belt or even Oort Cloud once that gas and dust material has been dispersed. What this suggests is that the outer layers of our own solar system would in fact be one of the youngest parts of our own solar system and that any TNO-objects (including Pluto) are formed billions of years later than Earth and all the objects in our own direct vicinity such as Mercury, Venus, Mars, the nearby Asteroids, etc..."
Man Cooks up an idea then finds something to justify their pretext. Dyson sphere. That is basing the reasoning for such a construct on human ideas. Thus those aliens must be human and think like us. We can't even figure out what's on a cat's mind when we call it and it just stares at us. Figure that out and just maybe we could consider why an alien would make a craft 1iu across. Make them like us so they don't seem soooo alien.
Captivating !
"W T F....  ha...ha.  Yeah,  that's sooooo funny. Little 13 year olds running the scientific community now?"
waste
I hope that's the first target for the james webb telescope its launch is just right around the corner..
"Aliens do not exist, but the Creator does exist:

وَلا يُحِيطُونَ بِشَيْءٍ مِنْ عِلْمِهِ إِلا بِمَا شَاءَ
And they (people) will never assimilate anything of his Knowledge except that which He (Allah) wills.

وَسَخَّرَ لَكُمُ اللَّيْلَ وَالنَّهَارَ وَالشَّمْسَ وَالْقَمَرَ وَالنُّجُومُ مُسَخَّرَاتٌ بِأَمْرِهِ إِنَّ فِي ذَلِكَ لآيَاتٍ لِقَوْمٍ يَعْقِلُونَ 
And He (Allah) has harnessed for you the night and day and the sun and moon, and the stars are harnessed by His command. Indeed in that are signs for a people who reason."
The data were good
Something in space was blocking starlight - I know - ancient space liberals.Her lecture is pretty good though.
If the planet isent what we know why would our laws of physics apply there? We know sooooo little. Ignorance is a bliss.
"Wonder what Neil deGrasse Tyson has to say about this!? Neil, we want your opinion, now :) #neildegrassetyson"
Or it could be that the star system has several Jupiter sized planets that are all reaching an alignment. that could cause such a dip? If I'm misunderstanding what she was saying please correct me 😁
These dyson ball predictions of aliens are foolish.  With our technology today we need a solar panel array the size of Spain to handle global human electrical needs. In the future the panels will be far more efficient and the size will shrink. Never could an array many times the size of earth be needed. Any civilization able to produce something that size would have become efficient enough to not need it.
Maybe this star is just a lemon. In nature we occasionally see things formed incorrectly that behave in ways we could have never predicted. Why can't the same be said for a star?
"Nice piece of information, thanks."
What if its a large planet orbiting a closer star. The odd dips and lines could be the planet's moons that could be visible at the start(or end) of the dip but then are blocked out as they move in between us and the planet and vice versa.
Ahhhh. Lol solar sun spots. Hahahaha
Don’t bring bs until you have proof
"Honestly scientists annoy me sometimes, jeez, ""alien's should always be a theory of last resort"" ""I'm paraphrasing......I mean no, just no, if something points to aliens, it points to aliens, end of story, take emotion out of it completely! The data is either the data or it's not."
The data were good
If you don't understand something than it's aliens...or magic or god. Sounds very scientific.
Your reaching 7-21-21
isn't it possible that many different planets are between us and the star?  wouldn't planets far from the star block more of it's light?
I’ve got it Their computers were “” hacked” and as a side effect they’ve got extra funding So why’re they telling us about it So we start buying more telescopes and as a side effect they can make more money on the telescope’s stock
This woman's an idiot... Surely someone with your education has heard of sun spots right?? Hmmm... Ackoms razor comes to mind...
Turns out it's your mum.
*What will the hypothesis be once disclosure happens and it becomes known that Aliens have been here for millennia?*
Extraordinary claims only require evidence.
Maybe it orbits a little black hole
Would u want someone to give yours kids porasis.
"Is there any way that there is an object between the star and us, but the object is a lot closer to us, rather the star? (sorry for my English)"
At the start..”extraordinarily claims require extraordinary evidence”....er NO...they just require evidence. Sagan chose (for reasons best known to himself) to ignore a vast amount of testimony pointing in the direction that we have been visited by extraterrestrials for years....shame. Now that disclosure is being slowly rolled out through Tom DeLonge and ex-Pentagon employees history will judge Sagan as well meaning but hopelessly blinkered.
how about multiple planets converging -??
Not a rocket science to know...I'm the most mysterious star in the universe.
"make movie script already, sci-fi or sci-fa."
If a planet of that size had moons wouldnt that also create the anomalies that we are seeing?
old books talk about a space war going on above our planet
"It could be anything!... Allien intelligence would be about 200 positions lower in the hypothesis ladder! Or first on top for the matter! This is not science! As the article's title implies, w.t.f.!..."
Black rock formations?...
"Of course we know now that it is a natural explanation that we just did not know at the time.  Once we looked at the full spectrum it became clear that not all the spectrum was being blocked.  Therefore, it is not an opaque object, just a bunch of dust."
"Вы думаете как светят звезды, а стоило бы и о том почему вы видете свет от этой звезды."
Logic dictates that an advanced civilization would not need structures the size of multiple planets in order to harvest energy from a star. My two cents.
I wrote a story a minute ago about this...  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtW84Uo9r2E
the women was failing ... its all dust and commet belt ... no aliens idiot
What if it was something in orbit far closer than that star?
Death Star it is
Stanton Friedman: astronomers will be the last to know about alien life
It's a big shame that many includung the representer are giggling at the subject. What is so funny about that?
Flat earth she lie angels going for a spin.
"And that it has some thing attached to it by its gravitational pull ?
Some commets may be"
What if it was a rough planet which is just travelling towards earth from near that star ?
The most mysterious star (so far) in the universe
It happens every Two Years. This should give them a clue.
Why can’t it be a simple explanation that other orbits are conflicting with this star- since you’re looking through a soup of stars and objects
Stronger pull of dark energy quantum fluctuation
I just kept thinking about Lesile Winkle from Big Bang Theory
May be a dumb question - What if the planet objecting the star traveled straight to the line of sight of kepler instead of passing horizontally? That could explain the longer duration
Couldn't get through the bullshit fashion ad at the beginning.
"Nice try, alien lizzard queen!!!"
"Looks like the ""object"" is a set of objects clumped together in orbit."
Conjunction of several planets within their orbit producing differing degrees of light reduction...
"Accretion. 
Sounds like shes fishing for funding."
A swarm of material seems the most likely.
Couldn't a super massive planet in a highly eccentric orbit do this if the line of apsides of the orbit was orthogonal  to the observer? It would move slower at the start of the transit and as it got towards periapse would speed up. It seems like that would at least explain the non-symmetrical light curve.
Hand of god!
Answer: 42!
"I gotta say, it does look like a giant spaceship that can move by itself and looks like this c> and rotated on its X-axis or something.
I think an advanced Dyson sphere would create a lot more irregular patterns."
Wow they have so many camera men getting the actual footage in space of these stars!....😒
Dreamt about this all last night.
sunspots.
Stupid pointless cow. Where did she get her qualifications from? Back of a cornflake packet maybe.
"Amazingly lame, for a TED talk"
"There's something ""catchy"" right there AT THE VERY BEGINNING of this ""talk"" - the first or second phrase she says sounds kinda WEIRD! On ONE SIDE she states that (quote): ""ALIEN HYPOTHESES SHOULD ALWAYS BE A ""LAST RESORT"" (in other words - the ""natural causes"" are always a more suitable explanation for anything ""out of the ordinary"" that we do observe in the Universe), while ON THE OTHER SIDE...I got the feeling she almost wants to say exactly the opposite - just like she's been ""preparing the stage"" for ""breaking into pieces"" the same thesis she thrown at you at the beginning. :) This is one of the reasons I LOVE these ""talks"" or ""speeches"" (however you wanna call them!). These people aren't just brilliant in Sciences, but they are AWESOME in the WAY THEY PRESENT SCIENCE. :) :)"
Why aliens can not be natural explanation??? Why
"So, you’re saying it’s definitely aliens 👽. Got it."
#PraiseKek
science dont know nothing bout the creation of Gods art. they always think everything is explainable. there are millions of things that are NOT too be explained
Amazing.  Thanks.
Talk about fantasy and speculation.
Humans are stupid
Ignorance isn't proof for any hypothesis
This is just an insane what if session and nothing more. It's not aliens.
blah blah
Scientist like you dont even know where stars come from and it right before your eyes
How about a star circling around a black hole? That can be explained and measured.
"Doesn't the relative distance of the object between the star and earth make a huge difference? Perhaps this object isn't orbiting close to the star, could it be a mass or masses in a cluster much closer to us than the star we're looking at that just happens to be floating in front?"
Wtf
what was the neburu galaxy's
This is an example of how a scientist can turn into a nutcase..
Probably something like J1407B with massive rings.
I read about this in newspapers
8:17 good one lool.......scine do never seams to stop to amaze me :D
Uhhh could you repeat that ?
Aliens dont need to capture energy from the sun... thats so dumb
Carl Sagan would be sad to have his name tied to such unscientific speculation.
Aliens have been found many years ago.
Its Thanos! Defalcating all those planets he consumed.
Just absolutely awesome You Take My Breath Away
I go with the theory that the star is aging/changing state and unstable.
I would guess a fractured plant or moon that is in a captured orbit by the star in a descending orbit that is coming closer on one leg and is on a collision course with this star.  The increase  in dip and time is due to slowing of the captured plant.
I wonder how hairy it is..
When will humans admit that we just don't know everything!!!!
The data were good.
Lol best to say you have no idea !
I viewed another theory of inconsistant diming of a star due it being a twin star orbit where one feeds on another effecting the larger emitter of light.
there is infinite life out there.
probably the aliens too are looking at us right now and thinking the same thing.
This entire explanation and we don't understand. Back to we don't understand.
what were there smoking ?
I don be believe it s alien.. It s natural...
what does the light spectrum say
"So you invoke Star Wars for something unusual in a shadow? This is why scientists are some of the most stupid and ignorant people on the planet. This, people, is why you should pursue engineering and not science. Thank me later."
Super moon Sunday
"this thing thats disturt the light is a metal  thats melt  ang become solid  ,melts and solid 
melt solid mellt     by soony timbol"
"And, this information will help Humanity free themselves from the psychotic banksters and bleedership?"
I think the Electric Universe theory might shed a light on this (no pun intended).
"the topic of this talk is also the plot premise of Peter. F. Hamilton's ""Commonwealth Saga"""
Just entering my thoughts. Maybe the star has two cores inside of it. It was once a two star system and one star exploded. It's core was almost a black hole and was consuming it partner but instead fell into it. Now one side is much heavier than the other causing all the matter to settle in one area.
"This title is incorrect, It should read,... ""The most mysterious star with-in our visible universe"", this would be the correct wording."
on this video you SEE the most fanatical mysterious(Mysterion? :) believer on our planet
Its obvious its a structure
"She seemed like a credible scientist.. until she said ""Ginormous""."
maybe its just an unusual orbital pattern of a cluster of planets tapering in size ? id be modelling the star on computer with different hypothetical planet configurations to see if some type of harmonic relationship could recreate the same dip.. then start throwing out the least likely of any possibilities.. I think initially you have to assume its planets and/or dust in a weird structure..
A dip in light... there’s your damn proof of life for some of you. Sounds like a funding campaign to me.
Haven't figure it out yet?
"The title should read the most mysterious star we know of, otherwise calling it in 'the universe' is an expansive topic"
now imagine how advanced they are now if they already had that kind of tech nore than 1400 years ago
"Why don't you just calculate the shape of the hypothetical (single) object, that would have to pass the star to create these curves? It would have a small tip, getting thicker until a certain point where it gets tremendously large for some time, just to have a quite steep/blunt back end without slopes like the front. It's not hard to tell that this would not look like a comet or a dyson sphere..."
"Awesome!  Tabby's star explained by Tabby!  So cool.  Well done presentation Ms. Tabetha, thank you."
Reading the comments and what is it?? White people telling corny jokes.. EVERYTIME 😑
"One of the better TED talks- loved her direct approach, and how she managed to take the lay audience on a journey through some very specialized data!"
Scientist society are the choosing people To be the leaders of the future
BULLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLSHITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
Omg ...this people are solving the large amount of information on planets light year away .....and cant contribute to solve problem on earth regarding poverty terrorism etc...should i really trust on this info...🙄
You would probably see similar behavior from near by stars if it were Aliens. A civilization that advanced would probably harness more than a single star.
It is possibly a destroyed planet(s) and a galatic alien fleet after a battle.
"FREE is undertaking the WORLD'S FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ACADEMIC RESEARCH STUDY ON UFO RELATED CONTACT WITH NON HUMAN INTELLIGENCE-- The FREE Experiencer Research Study. http://www.experiencer.org/initial-research-data-summary/.. Much of our research findings contradict what is circulating in mainstream Ufology. FREE has an 11 member Board of Directors comprised of Ph.D. Physicists, Ph.D. Scientists, Ph.D. Psychologists, Ph.D. Neuroscientists and lay researchers. The Dr. Edgar Mitchell FREE Foundation (Foundation for Research into Extraterrestrial and Extraordinary Experiences) is a 501c3 ACADEMIC Not For Profit Foundation. FREE was co-founded by the late Dr. Edgar Mitchell, the 6th man on the moon, and Dr. Rudy Schild, an Emeritus Professor of Astro-Physics at Harvard University. Harvard Professor of Astrophysics, Dr. Rudy Schild, is our EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR.
--------------------------------------------------------------
No one has ever attempted this type of ACADEMIC research study on Experiencers before. Before our study was launched in 2013, we knew very little about this phenomena except for thousands of individual case studies and a few small research initiatives. As of September 2017, we have accumulated over 5,000 survey responses to our 3 surveys, in 5 major languages (English, Spanish, German, French, Slovak and soon Chinese), from over 110 countries.

"Dyson spheres may be the dumbest idea from really smart people. Advanced aliens wouldn't need to create such huge structures for energy, they would know ways of extracting energy from the very small. Something we already know how to do."
"Is it just me or has ""science"" gotten a little too hypothetical...?"
"Well Tabetha, may I call you Tabby? Why is it Tabby that you suspect the star is only the size of our sun? and you use the size of our earth (X 1,000) to compare what was observed (perhaps both were larger or both smaller)?  We also KNOW that collisions ""cannot defy the laws of physics"" so there is no possible crash event in the past that caused our moon to form in a perfect size and orbit with us (and with no rotation!).  We also know that marine life cannot survive without the moon. . . This certainly kills the opening pages of the ""Theory of Evolution"" concocted by Charles Lyle and Charles Darwin and misinterpreted by everyone since.   Why would you even expect to see anything in only four years?   Is NASA crazy?!  How many of our larger planets actually orbit our average size sun multiple times in four years?  DUH@#%&?  I like the alien stuff - but it will be hard to document.  NASA should send a journalist.  One last question:  We know that sun light is destructive to all objects, living or not, on our planet except one:  CHLOROPHYLL.  Why would brilliant aliens want more of this dangerous form of energy?"
its not being blocked. The star is being used as a power source so when the aliens come home and turn on their tvs the sun dims until the initial load is stabilized. Think of it as a brownout in the power grid.

can you say black holes
"how do they differentiate between objects like asteroids, space debris, and even objects within our own solar system from blocking this light??"
"Interesting that the reason it took Citizen Scientists to find the star was a ""Dinosaur count problem.""    (If you don't know the story, in Michael Crichton's novel _Jurassic Park_ mathematician Ian Malcolm figures out that the ""dinosaurs"" are breeding by realizing that the park is only looking for what it expects to see.  When he changes the parameters of the counting programs to unlimit the computerized count of the animals, there are far more than expected.)"
where theres smoke theres fire........sendem a ping or two and i bet they bump back!!!

how about moving black holes ?

Very fascinating lecture. Why all these stupid comments?
A planet with a ring structure like Saturn could cause this! Where's my noble prize please?!? :)
Is this becoming bigger or is it closer?
Hey let me talk at a ted talk
It’s probably an asteroid belt or a dust cloud.
"harvesting a stars energy by using a so called Dyson Sphere seems to me unlikely. An alternative energy source that doesnt require unimaginably large technological structures would be far more likely to supply the vast energy requirements of an advanced civilization. a much more likely hypothesis is that a still massive but far more basic structure was created in an attempt to communicate with ET civilizations. what im envisioning is huge, simple, opaque objects that would be oriented around the host star. these would then be manipulated to control the amount of light broadcasted. logically, these would be at purposefully random intervals to distinguish from natural rhythmic astrophysical processes. could this be an interstellar beacon, from a spectacularly exotic and pleadingly lonely life form dwelling in a distant solar system light years away? only time will tell..."
5:00
"Why, exactly, should the alien technology hypothesis (0:23) be a last resort? If it is scientifically feasible, in what sense is this hypothesis less valid than all others? (But no, it's not a Dyson sphere/swarm. Boyajian's Star is of spectral type F3V, almost certainly too hot to be hosting a habitable planet.)"
"there could be any number of interstellar objects drifting in space and blocking the light....objects no where near the star in question....distant asteroids in our own solar system could cause it, or debris from or beyond our Ort cloud.....that must happen all the time, right?"
"im sorry but...how far away is this star?
from the souds of it it is raly far. so . other solar systems? closer astroids? closer comets ect..."
"As it was 1,280 years ago."
"So the data sticks out at you because its irregular, then its adopted to be a megastructure around the star? Forgive me but that would still present in a regular pattern. So now were talking about a shapeshifing megastructure which blasts out undetectable waste heat. Gimme a break. Great example on how true science has devolved. A few years from now this will be called fact and countless other theories will use this case study as source material. what a joke."
R u pregnant
"What will it mean when we find another star we can't explain?
What will it mean when we don't find one?

Tabby, it just means we're nowhere as smart as we think we are, that's what it means."
"seti: hello?
(3000 years pass)
KIC 8462852: new phone who dis"
"She doesn’t mention the possibility of the star in orbit around a black hole. That would also move fast enough to produce the 5-6 year period of the data reappearing. The only difference being the black hole absorbs the light rather than blocking it, but the concept is the same."
It's interesting how curiosity leads us.
earth is ONLY 11x smaller than Jupiter??? really? I thought earth was much smaller...
Aliens would be a natural explaination. The alternative is to say that living things are supernatural.
Its a Metallic object... It has a massive EM field.....  Its axis has a whobble.
I'm a flat earth Believer! She been drinking at her job don't listen to her
Why couldn't it just be huge asteroid fields orbiting the planet?
I'm open to any FlatEarther theories on the matter. How does the Gods word in the Bible explain this?
What a stupid woman. She should stay home and look after her family rather than waste time and money.
Electric Stars are powered by inter galactic birkeland currents.  There is NO MYSTERY HERE.   Just the response of a highly variable current flow into the capacitor .
just goes to show how out of touch with REAL Science that astrophysics actually is.  COMPLETELY HYPOTHETICAL RUBBISH based on Erroneous Conjectures... NOT EVEN WORTH anyones time to listen to.
Aliens my ass.:D
"Let's be real people, It's probably Jesus."
"a charming lady, super intelligent and elloquent

hats off"
why cant we assume that the cloud dust existing around the star is rotating about it that is like observing a plate rotating about its x or y axis
I am surprised scientists are still tip toeing around the fact other species exist. Be fresh and original. Admit to your fellow man that yes aliens are real.
My grandpa died in this battle.
"What is most interesting to me, in this discussion, is the power of suggestion. We're all looking for explanations based on something blocking the light from the star, because that's the explanation the astronomer has suggested. Why isn't anyone proposing that  the star itself might be changing its brightness? 
By the way,  Tabetha Boyajian mentions Carl Sagan's famous statement that ""extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof"".  Sagan was wrong about this, I believe. The standard for determining whether a claim is true or false should not depend on how predisposed we are to believe it.  Our judgment about what is ""extraordinary"" or conversely, ""non-extraordinary"" is  subjective, based on our prior limited human experience and biases. Sagan's error is all too prevalent in the modern ""fake news"" environment, where people tend to accept uncritically anything that is consistent with their political or cultural biases, and require ""extraordinary proof"" for anything that is inconsistent with their beliefs."
how about... the reapers blocking the light from that star and are coming from deep space to wipe out all life in our galaxy?
"@01:57 
*""...the human brain has an amazing ability for pattern recognition""*
lol lol lol >>> I laugh because one pattern is so obvious to me.
now why can we link ideas like achiral and chiral to the fact holograms of photons resemble a square achiral cross and what turns out to be a chiral solution to the Pythagorean theorem.

eh?"
"Last I heard we are still debating the merits of an electric sun/space filled with plasma vs. nuclear sun/empty space [no ether] evolving to a nuclear sun with plasma and ether has today become a grid. ... and the theories are still evolving ... but 1480 light years away the aLIEns are planning an invasion?
The light from our Sun to reach us in light years amounts to 8 minutes?
This is what TED Talks has become, compost/medium for science fiction?

The most amazing thing about this information is how amazed 'sheeple' can be about something 1,480 light years away as having some fantastic influence over our lives [aLIEns]  but continue to ignore the surprises yet to come about the SUN and the MOON? 

Also why is it ye sheeple can not get along with your neighbors?
Are the aLIEns 1480 light years away friendlier than your current neighbors?

*Why don't the 'sheeple' get excited about why the hologram of a photon resembles a flattened Great Pyramid and crusader crosses ...'let there be light' is now worth reinvestigating?*
How about getting excited about this theory closer to home?

*The MASS-ive Great Pyramid is a model of the mass-LESS photon*

you heard it hear first...maybe we can use this info to heal the world of the heels? 
yes the two worlds quantum and relativity just collided and it wentd 'chirp'

2 thumbs down before TED Talks and the brave new world dumbs us down ..."
"You make a pretty profound suggestion with basically no logical arguments to why or how, yet you keep reminding us of your supposedly doubtful scientifical approach to avoid aliens as part of a explanation.

If you want to believe that is nothing to be coy about, trying to convince others that you don't jump to conclusions about aliens while you jump to conclusions about aliens is not empowering your perceived theory with scientifical confidence, simplicity or stastitical probability which indeed is helpful to any scientifical theory but even more so for a partially religious theory as this. 

Religious in the sense that your pursuit and enthusiasm about a purely fictional though logical speculation.

Isn't is just a good argument to say it's based on miniature black holes, gravitational bending of futons, corrupted data due to unforeseen and temporary bugs or disturbance from electrodynamic or radiation irregularities which could deeply effect the equipment without causing permanent damage thus hard to detect? There's more theories based on probability of human error or inability to perceive natural phenomenon than stastitical based observed suggestion of a type 2 civilization of aliens."
so you found a star that gets dimmed by some asteroid ring  and let your imagination go wild..
She looks like little older version of Tove Lo.
What if there is a nearby black hole?  Have they attempted to look in to that theory?
"bla bla bla...more fairy tales plz... 
...ZzZ...zZz..."
the earth is flat
Any updates on this star now?
What is this collision; Earth-Moon forming event nonsense?
"Maybe it was just an ultra-unlikely transit of a rogue planet that's significantly closer?
Doesn't explain how it happens twice though."
"As much as I like it to be aliens, did they ever stop to think that it might be several if not dozens of planets that orbit this star that just happen to have a longer orbit around this star?  What if the anomaly is really just a long orbit for many planets/space debris and the most recent event of fluxes are just them sort of going in front of each other in an overlapping orbit that happens in that large of an orbit?
Is this a plausible theory to have?"
"Sun spot. One small sun spot on KIC 1480Light years away, would have that effect,  I suppose."
"The most simple and therefore most likely answer is the Star simply passed through a weak Plasma field and flickered. As we exist in a Plasma Universe, an Electrical phenomenon would very easily explain this anomoly. We have all seen a light bulb flicker when the power source is disturbed. Likewise all stars are Electrical by Nature, made purely of Plasma and are variable in nature, being powered by the universal plasma fields that permeate the entire universe... Please see the work of Nobel Laureate for Physics Hannes Alfvén for a more detailed explanation into the Electric Universe"
I personally do not believe in aliens.
"Keppler isn't conclusive for finding transits. It requires 3-d thinking. Imagine we're looking at the Sun from a top - down view. In that way we will miss all transits as it will be like looking at a clock. So there could be hundreds of planets missed simply because their orbits will never pass the line of sight from their parent star towards Earth. There could be planets orbitting a star within 15 lightyears without us knowing anything about it simply because the planets will never block the incoming light as they orbit their parent star not on the same plane as we are orbitting our star.

There is currently no Dr Who season playing.  My suggestion is this will be Dr Who's latest adventure . It obviously will be in the next season. Issue solved.
What if it's just a binary star system and the smaller one of them dead.   Gravitational pull from the larger one stripped the hydrogen from it's smaller sibling exhausting it's fuel .  Orbit has not decayed enough yet to be ingulfed and the long time period could be attributed to their slow orbit around each other and thier relative proximity to each other.
What if it was not an object but the light output of the star itself.
Who's the discoverer?  I guess he/she deserves credit!
It sounds like a massive object  (like a small black hole) has an elliptical orbit around the star. I guess objects which come from outside of the star formation should have elliptical orbits.

And why does everyone think aliens would be using radio transmissions?
Could the star itself be unstable? Maybe a problem with a fusion reaction ?

"I find it funny how 'scientist' always seem to think they're the 'smartest' when in reality if information wasnt so secret and closed off, many ordinary people can contribute and make extraordinary findings. Humans collectively are smart and you find some of the smartest people on forums with amazing hypothesis and analysis that don't care about making a name for themselves. 'Scientist' on the other hand, want that fame and recognition, hence why almost all information is closed off and another reason why their answers might take longer or even be incorrect"
May be what this possible alien civilization is building is a fort? A defensive structure to try and fight off some marauding predatory species who want their resources.
Well presented.
First how big is that star size wise? Second how does this study compare to the study of other stars with planets that cross in front of them? Third how do scientists know that the size of planets is limited rather unlimited? How come these questions were not answered?
"As a back yard mechanic, I would say that the star itself needs a tune-up...air filter, fuel filter and a set of spark plugs.  Has anyone given any thought to the dip in light energy to that, or water in the fuel of the star itself?  Tainted fuel and bad plugs will do it all the time.  Just saying."

Congratulations.   You discovered a big dust cloud.
"I suspect this is a binary star system where the second star is a carbon star.  This would explain why there is oclusion or clouding as the carbon star passes in front of the main star but there's no boost in brightness as the carbon star nears it's pass behind the main star.  If it's possible that their co-orbit is not restricted to a plane it may also explain why occlusions, or darkening, are seemingly irregular. It should be possible to measure the wobble of the primary star to determine what the mass is of the co-orbiting body."
"Could it be a giant cluster of black dwarves orbiting a super massive star or galactic cloud, like some sort of stellar graveyard? Or a binary system containing a black dwarf and a red dwarf being orbited by several planets? I mean, I'm no astronomer, but these solutions seem out-of-the-box enough for this exceptional problem."
"The Moon: An Unexplained Phenomenon ""It seems much easier to explain the nonexistence of the moon than its existence."" Dr. Robin Brett, NASA Scientist Here is a collection of interesting quotes from scientists, authors, researchers, NASA insiders and star-gazers relating to the enigmatic and often inexplicable nature of the moon: Isaac Asimov, American author and professor of biochemistry at Boston University and Science Fiction writer. Asimov was one of the most prolific writers of all time. ""We cannot help but come to the conclusion that the Moon by rights ought not to be there. The fact that it is, is one of the strokes of luck almost too good to accept… Small planets, such as Earth, with weak gravitational fields, might well lack satellites… … In general then, when a planet does have satellites, those satellites are much smaller than the planet itself. Therefore, even if the Earth has a satellite, there would be every reason to suspect… that at best it would be a tiny world, perhaps 30 miles in diameter. But that is not so. Earth not only has a satellite, but it is a giant satellite, 2160 miles in diameter. How is it then, that tiny Earth has one? Amazing."" ""The Moon, which has no atmosphere and no magnetic field, is basically a freak of nature"" Irwin Shapiro, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics “The best possible explanation for the Moon is observational error – the Moon doesn’t exist.’ ""The Moon is bigger than it should be, apparently older than it should be and much lighter in mass than it should be. It occupies an unlikely orbit and is so extraordinary that all existing explanations for its presence are fraught with difficulties are none of them could be considered remotely watertight."" Christopher Knight and Alan Bulter Book: Who Built the Moon? The Moon has astonishing synchronicity with the Sun. When the Sun is at its lowest and weakest in mid-winter, the Moon is at its highest and brightest, and the reverse occurs in mid-summer. Both set at the same point on the horizon at the equinoxes and at the opposite point at the solstices. What are the chances that the Moon would naturally find an orbit so perfect that it would cover the Sun at an eclipse and appear from Earth to be the same size? What are chances that the alignments would be so perfect at the equinoxes and solstices? Farouk El Baz, NASA ""If water vapour is coming from the Moon’s interior is this serious. It means that there is a drastic distinction between the different phases of the lunar interior – that the interior is quite different from what we have seen on the surface."" Mikhail Vasin, Alexander Shcherbakov, Societ Academy of Sciences, 1970. ""Is the moon a creation of an alien intelligence?"" Dr Harold Urey, Nobel Prize for Chemistry ""I’m terribly puzzled by the rocks from the Moon and in particular of their titanium content."" Dr S Ross Taylor, Geochemist of lunar chemical analysis, Said the problem was that maria plains the size of Texas had to be covered with melted rock containing fluid titanium. He said you would not expect titanium ever to be hot enough to do that, even on Earth, and no one has ever suggested that the Moon was hotter than the Earth. ""What could distribute titanium in this way? Highly advanced technology developed and operated by entities that are immensely more technologically advance than humans."" Dr. Gordon MacDonald, NASA ""it would seem that the Moon is more like a hollow than a homogenous sphere’. He surmised that the data must have been wrong – but it wasn’t."" Carl Sagan, Cosmologist, ""A natural satellite cannot be a hollow object."" Dr. Sean C Solomon, Massachusetts Institute of Technology ""The Lunar Orbiter experiments had vastly improved knowledge of the Moon’s gravitational field and indicated the frightening possibility that the Moon might be hollow."" University of Arizona Lon Hood ""We knew that the Moon’s core was small, but we didn’t know it was this small… This really does add weight to the idea that the Moon’s origin is unique, unlike any other terrestrial body."" NASA scientists The Apollo 12 mission to the Moon in November 1969 set up seismometers and then intentionally crashed the Lunar Module causing an impact equivalent to one ton of TNT. The shockwaves built up for eight minutes, and NASA scientists said the Moon ‘rang like a bell. Maurice Ewing, American geophysicist and oceanographer ""As for the meaning of it, I’d rather not make an interpretation right now, but it is as though someone had struck a bell, say, in the belfry of the a church a single blow and found that the reverberation from it continued for 30 minutes."" Ken Johnson, Supervisor of the Data and Photo Control department during the Apollo missions ""The Moon not only rang like a bell, but the whole Moon wobbled in such a precise way that it was almost as though it had gigantic hydraulic damper struts inside it."" Moon rocks have been found to contain processed metals, including brass and mica, and the elements Uranium 236 and Neptunium 237 that have never been found to occur naturally. Dr. D L Anderson, Professor of geophysics and director of the seismological laboratory, California Institute of Technology ""The Moon is made inside out and that its inner and outer compositions should be the other way around."" Dr. Robin Brett, NASA Scientist ""It seems much easier to explain the nonexistence of the moon than its existence."""
Wtf 😂😂

Larry Niven's Ringworld
"A scientist who sugest aliens as an explaination when there is no other explaination. Uh where came the aliens from? I know! God created them. But using aliens as an explaination means that God can be exluded because it dosent fit in the evolution. So bright to digg in some unexpainable things when they cant explain basics of universe, like: why are some planets spinning in wrong direction, how did the moon end up utside the earth? I have olny heard some tricky explainations, tricky things every time ? Sounds more like exuse for something that cant be explained."
An argument from ignorance isn't 'extraordinary evidence'.
creation of mighty god is unexplainable more and more out there
The fan art of the mega structures are all symmetrical like planets so it can’t be that (shape wise)
What a waste of taxpayer money. Why don't they put these scientists working on the EARTH and it's problems. What has all of their knowledge done for mankind?  Teflon pans? that poison us?  All of the money spent since Galileo has done what? GPS?  Great.
"maybe theres a black hole somewhere on the way between us ans the star thats ""eating up"" some of its light."
King kong did this innit
"""We had to find a way to rule out aliens"" is she for real?
Is this a propaganda video where clearly they do not manage to explain something and keep coming up with bullshit?"
"Aliens blowing up planets to mine them does seem very efficient, after all we blow things up all the time to make it easier to mine stuff all the time"
My money is on Aliens built a Dysons Sphere.
Do we really have to add the word ginormous to the English language ?
"a brown dwarf getting in the way, maybe."
Umm HUH?
Hmm... I wonder if it’s a completely new entity in space we’ve never come across before.
"where would these 'aliens' get the material to build such a structure?  if they used material from their planet, it would seem to me they wouldn't have a planet left to live on!"
"Nonsense. Aliens gog and magog are waiting to enter  though another DIMENSION, And stupid nasa is wasting money gazing at the stars"
"Alien Megastructures? Ok but what about the mass and the gravity of these structures? Any object that size will, like moons and planets gravitationally collapse. Any aggregtion of matter that size will planetize or prehaps even stellarize."
"Perhaps a binary star system viewed 'from above' giving constant brightness.  The planets lie out of the orbital plane and pass between us and the binary stars.
This could account for the large change in brightness if the stars are smaller but appear larger because it is binary.
It could account for the long duration because the binary system would appear to be rotating in the same apparent direction as the planets orbit.
It could account for the uneven brightness curve due to the same reason above.
If it passed over one star and then over the other it could produce the complex pattern at the end of the data."
"Seems silly to say aliens aren't ""natural"" answers.  We are aliens as long as we are seen by anywhere else in the universe besides Earth and we consider ourselves natural."
Limited information and limited imagination are a far more likely explanation.
actually it makes sense for this to be a proto-star. a gigantic gas bag just shy of fusion in its core. aka a brown dwarf.
its being orbited by a blackhole
What if it's just multiple different planets passing by the star light in rare layout?
"What are the odds that we would choose one tiny spot, in a vast universe, and hit upon signs of an alien civilization on our 1st attempt. If that were the case, then it would be likely that there is advanced alien life all over the universe. While I do believe that lesser complex life is frequent in the universe, I think the odds of finding advanced intelligent life will be found to be quite small. So this star mystery is most likely to have a natural explanation. Either that or the universe is teaming with life, and it's difficult to look at a section that is devoid of intelligent life. By intelligent, I mean they have to ability to create anything that can be detected over these vast distances."
What if this is actually a set of smaller objects a lot closer to us that lacks a star that orbits each other causing this effect? Then they don't need to be huge alien structure objects but maybe merely neptune size or even smaller?
"What if 2 small black holes are orbiting the star in an eliptical orbit? that cancel out each others gravaty so the star won't wobbel. Or what if 2 of 3 very larges objects, like jupiters align there orbit so into one direction you get a massive solar flair (because of the combined gravity), causing the rest of the star to dim? While the whole solar system is tilted in some way, so we do not see the large object causing this? or what if the start is rotating very fast because it was hit on the side by a smaller star and having another object orbiting the star in the opposid direction, causing fluctuations in the corona? could this explain the data?"
"The dimming pattern is similar to a rubber band, storing energy slowly as it is being stretched, then releasing it quickly when it is shot. Or a bubble, which stores the pressure as it expands, until the moment it can't anymore, and pops instantly.
But no aliens. There aren't any aliens, except in grant proposals."
"Let's really think about the alien technology theory. An object that is so massive that it dims the light of the star. Using our own solar system as an example, Jupiter doesn't even come close to blocking that much light. The object is more than 10 times the size of Jupiter. Where would the resource materials needed to construct an object that massive come from? Specific materials are required for specific energy harnessing, where would that be gathered from? Entire planets would have to mined, if not fully consumed, to get resources. I have an incredibly creative imagination, but this seems too much for even a fantasy story.

One other point, the platform used to view that chunk of space can only see light variants, we will never see any of the possible planets or aliens spheres that is ""revealed"" here. We will never know what has really been observed."
"11:28 well technically, it would fit with the a long time ago. Not so much with the in a galaxy far far away, but whatever..."
What if it was just multiple planets of variant sizes?
Yeah but that dress. Eeks!
"Like the computer in the Crichton novel ""Jurassic Park,"" that only counted the number of dinosaurs it was programmed to expect..."
why not just smaller ships or asteroids etc. only much closer to us? Maybe there's an intergalactic space-freeway smack dab in the middle between that star and us?
"The spacedust is clearly quite easy to explain away:

"Extraordinary Claims only require evidence, not extraordinary evidence. Scientist need to learn more about logic, and philosophy."
12:17 her baby kicks. Awesome.
It couldn’t have been multiple planets aligning?
"""WTF"" is NOT an acronym."
"What was not covered, was that a review of old images of that section of space showed that the star has slowly been getting dimmer over the last hundred years.  That is very consistent with  growing megastructures being built around the star."
and we have people who think that the earth is flat
"Not so important when it happen if 2000 years ago or 1 week ago, it make a huge different there was alien at all or no aliens. If we start to see a lot of other clever creatures around us maybe we can understand our planet to or understand why we live and what our life is about."
We have to build byways....
how about a black hole between earth and the star ?  Black hole is moving around a bit sucking light from the star.  That is 2 beer thinking. 3 beer is way better.
thousands of comets wouldn't but one asteroid belt might.
meh
My question is this: Will the James Webb Space Telescope in 2019/2020 will help us know more about it?
Illegal aliens stealing our sunlight
"It's nice she quoted Carl Sagan's famous words first. That she understands it is extremely unlikely. That there are probably hundreds of 'more plausible' theories. However, all you really need to do is look at the hubble deep field image, go out side and look towards the sky through a straw and realize that small amount of space is what contains what you see in the deep field image to understand just how extremely unlikely it is that life does not exist outside of this planet. From single cell organisms to 'advanced civilizations'. However rare or uncommon it may be, there is no fkg way it's not out there."
How do we know that those dips are from objects in the star's orbit?
I read about a similar story with Jodrell Bank observatory jump the gun against the Soviets decades ago.
Lots of conjecture and theory! getting a Migraine! How about backing up your speech with proof! WTF
I know I'm probably sounding stupid but what if some part of a rocket was the one that's blocking it because some rockets brake apart when there in space.
"it is all stupid talk, wasted money that developed countries are stealling from the 3rd world countries."
"Aaaaaand.... a big planet with a big moon would be that much off? 
Binary planets would do too. 
Or a big planet with several big moos. Aaaaand the telescope gathers only a tiny fraction of the data available (i.e. a complete orbit of all planets and their satellites in their orbit of that particular system)"

"Why all the planets in the universe are round or circular,  are there any square planet out there?"
One obvious explanation hasn't been covered. We are witnessing the beginning of a phase change. The hydrogen is nearly spent and the temperature isn't hot enough to fuse helium yet. So it dims.
i wish people would stop calling far-away creatures 'aliens'.  they're not 'alien' until they leave home.
Where would you even get the raw materials to make a dyson sphere?
It means you're over thinking it''.
i haven't seen it but it wouldn't be us? i mean what if we are the last hope of a past history before the big bang and the big bang was the re-ignition of the universe engine saved by an ancient civilization?
"In my view, this can simply be explained by the fact that the dip can occur not by a close orbiting planet or object, but by an object say half way between us and this star. What that means the object in transit would have seem to be much larger in size from our perspective and would hide much of the star light and would seem to be transiting for a longer period because of the vast distances between us and the star"
It was getting interesting until pot head theories started to block light on the research.
"Those were probably millions of alien ships passing by, with a ginormous mother ship(that very big slope), i bet my money on that intergalactic war.

"JESUS !!! Universe creator and ambassador of love💘 my true inspiration....... There's a fine line between upward rising and downward falling motion and its only molecule's difference which is visible in real time by tossing an object upward to see it smoothly turn around into a downward falling motion........ Upward rising motion is gas molecule's in motion fired🔥up by its electron's creating an ENERGY FLOW up up and away the only rising motion in the universe....... Downward falling motion is gas molecule's trapped within solid objects known as bonding blocking its electron's fire🔥power becoming motionless. ....... Water too is motionless with oxygen hydrogen gas bonding trapping its molecule's unable to rise until sunlight energy splits its trapped molecule's freeing the gases which then rise upward into the atmosphere, its not evaporation...... Electron's from trapped molecule's are also motionless but always on high alert poised for action willing and ready to connect with the earth at the speed of light establishing a downward falling path/motion for trapped molecule objects only........ On the opposite side upward rising motion is brilliantly conformed as the ruling force of the universe named ENERGY FLOW with gas molecule's in motion fired🔥up by its electron's within raging star flames earth gases birds and baloons🎈plains and rocket's even us humans rise from ENERGY FLOW,  yes ! The ruling force of the universe. Note ! Jupiter robbed of its downward falling motion by upward rising gas storms overriding all surface activity's, Jupiter do not have downward falling motion thus its gravity free . Jupiter is an ENERGY FLOW planet with gas molecule's in motion fired🔥up by its electron's creating a massive energy attraction system pulling in numerous moons compared to earth,  which is an ENERGY LOCK planet with trapped gas molecule's within its solid body blocking it's electron's fire🔥power reducing its surface atmospheric activity's attracting less moons...... Visit YOUTUBE SUNLIGHT ELECTRO RAY'S showing planetary orbit's powered by sunlight energy not gravity."

This lecture is about the humility of science. Scientists are happy not knowing things. They are also happy to have amateurs and enthusiasts gather evidence and accept this evidence is also valid. Scientists accept the likelihood of alien life is close to 100%. Accepting this you also have to accept that aliens may indeed be the explanation for some observations. Not accepting this is bad science.
There is a bug on the telescope lens
they r saying it wrong.  the thing blocking it would not be that much bigger but have a gravitational pull that much stronger.   light bends to space time.   it's gravity fucking with the light.   what creates gravity like that.  oh I don't know maybe a BLACKHOLE.    open Ur eyes science.

Anything is possible we as human on planet earth can't explain %25 of the things that's going on on planet earth let alone what's happening in the solar system... just saying but it all sounds interesting...🤔
80% of this comment section is so close minded. To think that we are the only life out there is just pathetic.
"So, aliens built a death star and are at war and have a dyson sphere. Interesting."
abandonded planet?
"Hadn't really thought about it, but if the size of the pieces of a potential Dyson Sphere are greater than 239 k miles across (distance from Earth to Moon), those pieces would either have to be incredibly thin, or there wouldn't be enough matter orbiting KIC 846, or any star for that matter, for the raw materials to built a Dyson Sphere that could block such a high percentage of stellar light as observed from KIC 846. Unless maybe they were orbiting a very tight path around the star which would presumably ablate even as it collected solar energy. 

Mysterious indeed."

why couldnt the object(s) be closer to us? maybe something small enough to fluctuate the light? kind of like putting your hand infront of the sun..
Galactus...
"I don't believe you can assume size based on the dip.. Perspective is everything. For example, if we have a 100 * SOL star somewhere out there, and a gas giant or other large planet which developed far enough out.. there is the possibility of massive amounts of light being blocked.. 

There are so many variables.. You could be looking at a light refractory pattern from a comet, or from a planetary ring system, how about interference from an exoplanet, it could also be the curve of a post two planetary collision before the planet, and possible new moon, has begun to reform back into a spherical shape, or how about inclination with two bodies appearing on a single blip.... It could also be from light passing through a large enough atmosphere or an air / light-gas giant. Additionally, it could simply be a body on an elliptical orbit giving longer times and more light-blocking ability as it gets closer to us.

There are so many possible explanations of why the curves don't appear uniform - it could very well be the sun itself. We live in a universe far stranger than many can even begin to speculate about...

I have only seen the first minutes and I'll continue watching shortly.

Edit: You're right - a collision, in most cases, would produce a lot of dust and create a frosted-lightbulb quality... If a collision took place, and both bodies were comprised of mostly water, it could produce the effect of tens of thousands of chunks plus evaporating trails. Solid-water-comets!

As for an alien society, they would've likely reproduced what occurs in nature for energy as we are currently doing with leaf-structures to repel liquids, etc... Also, for your alien idea.. for them to build these structures - it'd probably be on a similar footing of the pyramids - they did it because they could, even though the pyramids had a purpose, a lot of structures being built are being built simply because we can and because it is a marvel to our ingenuity...



I'm leaning towards some of my other ideas, such as inclination with various bodies, and possibly rings or breached-rings rings, causing the dips... Imagine what Jupiter or Saturn their many satellites would look like as it enters to block and larger moons orbiting in and out of the light until the large dip.... I'd see similar readings from light passing through thinner / broken ring systems on top of a high number of natural satellites when running a thought-simulation.

And we still can't discount involvement from other bodies in the way ( gravitational lensing rerouting light through other systems, exoplanets, asteroid belts or rings, etc.. before arriving here )...

To me, these appear to be most on the nose."
crap
"But what if, they did not use a gigantic structures at all? What if they could harvest the star energy, by using but a simple solar panel that absorbs the light around it, and change it into energy?"
What about unstable stars? Is this out of the question?
"As she talks about another planet in another place in our universe using energy the way we do. Excuse me? 
That's a reach...even for a hypothetical circumstance."
"a scientist, who is qualified to be a well paid guesser or approver of a guess! wow science sure is useless.. would anyone anywhere ever, be able to give a proff of just one i mean just one provable, fact or usefulness attributed to science... but since im way above most here .. i will provide the answer.. it can be proven and its all repeated with the same end result, that is science has caused and made  idiots who make other idiots and educates one in believing, that an idiot is usefull, like as if science has ever been used for anything!"
"Please, Indonesian subtitle"
Two Jupiter sized planets orbiting each other circling their star.....
"If we can see in the past from light just reaching us then we are moving forward in space. If time exists presently with past images then time is affected by distance. If Time is affected by distance then it has a speed. Time is equal to the speed of light. Moving through space moves time......as you move away from earth and the distance increases then you stop time. Soon when you are one light year away you also see earth as it was one light year ago, this means time is not constant. The past the future and the present exist on one plane and depending on the perspective ( viewpoint ) in the universe you have depends on the time of the viewer and the time of something other then the viewer."
What a waste of time. Should've put 'Dyson Sphere' in the title.
"since stars are electric and anode discharges, means the star is on an electric circuit and the circuit varies in Intensity."

"Very interesting video I must say but the planets colliding theory is more plausible than she gives credit for. Because if the collision had happened a long time ago, then there won't be any radiating matter and these could have developed into the thousands of comets she stuck with in the end."
Lovely thank you.
You can throw Earthly physics out the window beyond this solar system.
"What if they were nothing more than instrumentation glitches?   Data obtained based on light gathering and analyzing instruments could easily be subject/susceptible to instrumentation problems/errors/malfunctions and false readings; especially, in the deep space environment.   These so-called findings could be due to unrelated natural/environmental interferences (cosmic rays etc.), as well as, internal electronic failures/constructs caused by transient power and/or temperature fluctuations, circuit board defects, or what have you.  The question is: What was done, if any, to rule out anomalies and false readings due to possible instrumentation problems or other target-unrelated events?   The discovery of an alien civilization capable of actively harnessing the energetic output of a star would be a most amazing finding to say the least, but we can't reach for the wildest speculation as the most likely explanation, when we haven't discarded the simpler scenarios that could account for the observations."
I'm sorry how is comet trail more forced than alien megastructures?
"So in other words, scientists have no clue what their looking at."
Truth be told.....very very little is known about space!  Nothing wrong with hypotheses.....but mankind knows almost nothing about space!
How much lsd is she on?
"I just want to know why there no data for locating the Kepler and or Hubble. 
The data is called co ordinates and as such, there is none and whoever claims to own these or run them, has no real time data in which to confirm their location and state nor any reasonable explanation of how to maintain them."
"Its in the description ffs... "" As astronomer Tabetha Boyajian investigated this perplexing celestial object, a colleague suggested something unusual: Could it be an alien-built megastructure?"""
"Having people look at the data, too, was a no-brainer actually. Computers are great at repetition and grunt work. But they only do what you tell them. Likely the computer programs do not look for or know to flag unusual data - because the programmer has to know what to capture before the software will do it. Now, you can program for exceptions. But since this was unexpected, it wasn't likely coded for. 

These type of research projects need more funding, for until we can actually visit, this is the only means for us to learn how our universe works, and thus learn how our part works. It is staggering once you know how much of our current everyday lives are affected by the technology initially derived from space research. Science is the foundation for new technology, and is the economic foundation to prosperity."
"Instead of asteroids, perhaps check for maybe 10, 12, 15? stars in line at the 'nice dip', and slihgtly out of line in the first, awkward dip, perfectly inline in the 'clean dip'.
The latter dip could be explained by gravitational speed changes in these planets, making them farther spread than in the first dip.
Now, if in the center is the biggest planet, this can be explained simply.
Not ASTEROIDS, but simple planets, interacting with gravity from it's sun AND the planets around."

"We don't understand what we see ... wait, it must be aliens!"
"Well, wouldn't the simpleste explanation just be that this star is a variable star of some sort? That's rare, but a quite familiar phenomenon.

On the other hand an interstellar molecular cloud could have passed between us and the star. This could explain the extremely long transit time and the lack of reemission signs. This cloud could even contain solid objects, swarms of asteroids or regions of condensing material.

The speech is probably meant to be inspiring for laymen to engage in these observations, but she is too quick to quit the road of reason in my opinion."
wOw
Advanced aliens would be a ridiculous longshot.
"of course, isn't there another possibility? isn't it possible that there's just something weird about the star itself and that its own energy is fluctuating wildly? I mean, I get that a dip in brightness indicates that a plan is passing in front of it, but stars have been known to substantially increase in brightness on intervals that are seemingly random such as is the case of Beetlejuice. so isn't it possible that a star exists that just randomly loses brightness briefly?

But it could by a Dyson Swarm. If this is a society capable of generating power from their entire solar system they would likely be aware of the problems with heat. A thermoelectric generator,  aka waste heat generator, would clearly be something they would take advantage of. specifically, a waste heat generator uses an energy or temperature differential to generate power. so it's not sufficient for you to have heat, you need heat and lack of heat to generate power. Some difference in temperature. This would effectively result in an even distribution of energy in such a way that it could come across as no different than the heat that would ordinarily be released by the Star. 

or maybe it's just a weird star."
ps I find it very strange that 1 of the most important issues in history that u think there is a possibility of ET life and the telescope is on another project! I would have thought that project could wait?Is it not more important that the  telescope should be turned towards potential ET life? find it odd indeed!
fascinating!
The universe's largest oort cloud.
yet some people think the universe and creatures exist by coincidence !!!
There's definitely a fly on the lens.
Get somebody some money to observe this star more closely. See what they can find. If the original data is good something extraordinary is happening there.
"you dont have to go far for proof of Aliens, check out Bentwaters or Yukon Terr sighting or JAL Pilots-UFO or Roswell or all the nuke sites that were buzzed by UFO, or the Knowles family or the grade school in England in 1966 sorry I forgot the name, Kecksburgh, Travis Walton, Betty and Barney  Hill listen to the astronauts like Gordon Cooper and others, read all the military documents during the 50s and 60s and 70s and 80s, there are to many to list but the first is the best check it out."
"I done believe energy = heat, it can but it does not have to."
"You hear the term ""tidal locking"" regularly as additional exoplanets are discovered, but there's a bigger version of this - and various space programs across the world take advantage of it: Lagrange points. The data showing irregular dips suggests to me that there are several large planets orbiting this star, and a significant number of them may have become naturally locked in the lagrange point of the next (larger) planet out. To top it all off, the ""smooth"" dips featuring regular minor oscillations suggests that every one of these planets have a ridiculous number of moons as Jupiter and Saturn do. Still, a shitload of moons is both imaginable and precedented as is is in our own solar system. The data pattern that has everyone on edge and talking aliens can be modeled as ""Natural Lagrange Point Locking"", which no one is imagining even though we know that nature finds the lowest energy level, and has only been precedented artificially. No, everyone would rather be jumping-ugly excited over the prospect of meeting the neighbors with whom we can swap each other's most fantastically destructive diseases."
"While KIC 8462852 may not be catchy, I loath that the media named it 'Tabby's Star'. That's not the naming convention. You cannot name stars after living people. And more importantly, she did absolutely nothing to deserve it. She did not find it. Citizen scientists found it, she stole their thunder. What's more she's exploiting her female privilege to take the spotlight, meanwhile the 99.999repeating% of astrophysicists out there working on far more interesting stuff than some space junk or a bad reading go unnoticed and unfunded, but because vagina, she gets mainstream news every time she farts."
Go home make babies. Dont do science woman.
An alien civilization is constructing a Dyson sphere around KIC8462852?
What about sun spots? really big ones? they are totally random and always different?Don't other stars have sun spots (solar flares)
طارق النجم الثاقب و الله أعلم
"May be they're absorption lines in the star's spectrum for known or even new elements, a giant sunspot group on the star, or a crazy fleet of alien spaceships."
"I theorize there is a Trump of the galaxy, and he built a dyson sphere, and mounted a white dwarf on top of it.

Ballin."
Ayyyyy lmaaaooo
"maybe, this star is attracting certain things to itself, hence when objects are getting closer to star, more light can they block, creating irregular peaks"
Yet another example of the CIA downplaying anything to do with UFO's
"A rotating, unsymmetrical rogue object which is far away from this star on a virtual direct route from this star to our position should explain all the data they have shown. According to its rotation it sometimes block more or less light. Like your thumb block the light of the moon to an eye, if the thumb is in the right position."
this lady is a scientist but has no commonsense and elementary logic when she speaks about Dyson sphere. these aliens need a lot of materials for construction and also need more energy to built that Dyson structure than the star can provides. Also do we have to believe that the information she got from observation is accurate and no interference was produced? It doesn't make sense this video except is for for advertising some obscure researches.
"I'm not saying anything about microwave ovens, but... I need to make some popcorn. And btw, I don't need anything to capture my imagination. Keep on working on those discoveries."
"why couldn't a brown dwarf between here and there explain this? just close enough to dim the light yet still not be able to see it? moving towards us or away from us to explain the week to happen, it's not rocket science?"
maybe it is not a mega structure but a smaller warping space device that sucks the energy like a black hole
"Great presentation, Tabetha!"
"Idk! Minus a great white bearded guy in the sky, the definition of a God is superior being. something had to make all of this. One, two, fifteen gods Idk! But I know that it's still not figured out and I think it took more than a instant Big Bang to produce the universe. aliens? Of course there are aliens. We are nothing special in trillions of stars, etc. . All I'm saying that the answer could be anything right now cause no one knows truly how the universe was created."
"Dyson sphere? Really? The amount of material it would take to build such a structure, in our own solar system would be more than the available, usable material in our solar system. 

Most likely it's a star that is part of a rapidly revolving pair, with the other star being a brown dwarf that would be big enough for the peak light drop off, and possibly is revolved by a couple/few Jupiter sized planets. The planets in orbit start the initial drop, and then the star itself moves in front of it's paired star.

This also accounts for the times the light doesn't show the strange slopes. The planets are not on that side of the dim star."
"they have NEVER FOUND ONE, PLANET. NOT ONE!"
"and I found out they faked the whole thing.

Makes no sense to me."
"Extraordinary claims... anyone notice how good ol' Carl snuck in a big chunk of subjectivity through the back door there?  ...mmm... apparently not.

Prejudice couched in sciency language, handed down from a Real Scientist.*  Lapped up, lo these many years.

*And someone whose later writings contain little nuggets that, combined with the secret-service subplot of ""Contact"" and a sense of historical perspective, have sparked a lot of rumours suggesting good ole Carl knew rather more than he was letting on.  At which point irony kicks in, who knows?  Today we have Neil DeGrasse Tyson doing much the same job, but without the undeniable charisma and iconic status."
"Why would we assume that ""they"" would be or do anything like us? How do we know that ""they"" need energy as we would? Why would they clean up anything or recycle anything? What if those are foreign concepts? Just because things work for us they way they do here, it does not mean it is the same out there. What if they can survive in the vacuum of space and don't need oxygen or have the need to eat like us? A lot of hypothetical thought and assumptions on our part."
"2 things come to mind that are not extra terrestrial in nature. The first is that there is a lot of distance between here and that star. That means a lot of room for items to block the view. Th closer it is the larger it seems. But then why does it only happen to this star? The second is that we only observed this for a relatively short period of time. We know that is take decades and some times more than a century for some of our own planets to make a full orbit. That would make it very difficult to see the full pattern and we could be seeing something perfectly natural for THAT system. In either case, we do not have the whole picture."
"The fact that most people even consider that it could be caused by aliens shows their wishfull thinking.It's like saying God did it without trying to find a better explanation.
That's what happens when you're involved with too mich sci-fi."
Why couldn't it just be some dark object or objects between the star and us.  Maybe a string of objects travelling in some orbit close to earth
"I wonder if the odd transits were caused by a large moon(s) orbiting the planet while it transits it's star ? Different stages of a rapid lunar orbit ""might"" cause the weird dip in the light signal ... maybe !!"
Do you think it is possible that the earth is flat?
HER TOTAL FAILURE in her proposal is the dreaded  '' either...or'' It has to be aliens or what ever...  total bovine excrement.. that's where she left  science behind...   projecting 'aliens' into a proposed conclusion  is  fucking  insane  and  without any evidence... 'not science'

"To know how big a planet is that is blocking light from a star, wouldn’t you have to know how far that planet is from the star?  Wouldn’t a smaller planet closer to the detector look to be the same as a larger planet closer to the sun?"

how much does the citizen scientist get paid $$$?
Why doesn't anyone suggest output by the star itself might not be constant?

"maybe its a message in those ""drops""? – a kind of morse code?"
"So she assumes that the only way that the light reaching us from a star could vary would be if something got in the way? No wonder the explanations don't stack up. 

This is what happens when you take an unproven theory as a fact and don't bother to question it.

Who says that the output from a star can't vary like this and why are they so sure?"
"Nice speech, to much phantasy. Lets do this with logic. Firstly the facts: Something is blocking the light of that star, meaning something is between us and that star. We also know that its not spherical and the mass of that matter is changing. We know the star is to old to be in the part of its life where it would be starting to form planets. Now what we can exclude what it is: a sphere, even if its called Dyson Sphere. Because spheres when they circle or things made by intelligent lifeforms would not be that irregular. They would more like show a pattern. Also we have a lot of material but not so dense or in a mass that it could ignite into fusion. Otherwise we would see it glow. Just so you know: Jupiter who would block 1% of OUR star just needs 80% more if its mass to ignite into fusion. This material blocks 2000% if the sunlight that Jupiter blocks. If it would be one combined natural occurring object, it would ignite or at least glow. That concludes that there are in fact more than one object. The question that remains is: what is it? Here we could go to the objects we know and simply compare. There is many kinds of material in space and its all part of a lifecycle somehow. Big objects that have the density like the stuff in question and also come in such volume usually form planets or suns. But it could also be something close to that that got destroyed. What I#m talking about is that most likely we have some material that was a sun / planets before and got broken up by some force in many parts. Could be by the star that we see the light blocked off, could be by something that passed by. What supports that theory: most suns come as a pair. It could be the second star that was maybe smaller and was hit by something big enough to burst it into parts. The parts would stop fusion because they are to small, have not enough gravity to be dense enough to create that kind of heat. Now... if this stuff is floating around that sun it would align in a dish. Maybe there is also one big part (former core) that pulls on the other material and doesn't allow it to spread very far. The movement of that material would be irregular and explain the ""shapes"" in the diagram. Also what we saw in the diagram could be more than one object, just objects in different size. Because most of our outer planets (with that mass it has to be a wide orbit around the sun to not fall in it) take many years to circle around the sun once. If we sum that up and expect there is more material it would also support the theory that this was the former twin of the star the light is blocked from. Because the mass would be at least 20 or more % of that star."
"I was thinking that it was a few huge planets that had a HUGE orbit...like you know 100 times the orbit of Pluto. Maybe it's so large that it would be able to orbit around the star due to its immense gravity. Also, because it's so far, it would cover more of the star light. that would explain a few things:
1. Why there were varying dips that were inconsistent
2. Why they just randomly come
3. Why there were huge dips"
my favorite game is eve online... they have these graphs in game and reward us to read them and identify points of interest.... so i guess we are the civilian scientists???
Ideas worth censoring
Maybe brown dwarf coliding with another big body?
That was excellent... Ma'am. Hats off..
massive spaceship
A rotating ring system could easily explain this.
To put it simply - if we find another star like that it means that there are more than one and who knows how many more.
"Young civilization, you are not yet ready to venture into our dark side. Beware evil lurks within us, the reptilian . :D"
Objection your honour! The speaker is drawing a conclusion!!!
"If the computers have missed dozens of planets then TBH they built the search program it uses wrong. So they really cant think of any thing it could be, i can think of many things it could be none of which are aliens."
"Seem to me that some people think that "" advanced species making advanced
civilizations""  is equal to  "" overpopulated planets "". I disagree.
For example an advanced civilization on earth could over time regulate their population to less then 67 million through good family planning. An advanced civilization would not grove too large and exhaust their natural resources. And never build ""dysonspheres"" even if they could.
Then maybe the Fermi-paradox is not a paradox anymore."
"So,
A.   We have stars that vary in brightness much MORE than this star
B.   We have stars that vary in brightness much LESS than this star

Conclusion:   This star is the most unique star in the universe..........hmmmmm

I'm not even an astronomer, and I know diddly about stellar physics, but my instincts say that this is scientific ""bike shedding"".    Theories about stellar physics are hard and only accessible to a few.   Guessing about things passing in front of a star
is a lot less hard, and nutty theories about ""dyson"" spheres are ridiculously easy to postulate.

Seems that an entire class of explanations is being totally ignored in favor of some sort of occultation......(Well it couldn't
be intrinsic variability, because ....just well it couldn't....must be a dyson sphere...C'mon guys..)

My bet is that this is some new aspect of stellar physics regarding stars on the border between proton-proton fusion and CNO fusion.     Notice that the star size is right at the boundary in size between these two types.   

Anyway...I'm not an astronomer.....just happened across this and I put in my 2 cents."
this is stupid you guys don't even find out the cause of the abnormality and already talking about aliens.
"1480 light years away , that's rather a good secure time buffer we got. They will not be able to receive our radio waves we started to send at the end of the 19th century befor 1300 years...  We have time to be prepared...."
"sorry guys, most likely not aliens. http://www.astronomy.com/news/2015/01/gigantic-ring-system-around-j1407b"
mega sunspots could cause this?
"The problem I'm seeing with this is that ideally a superstructure like that would have a consistent symmetrical shape, the graphs do not resemble that. I agree that the angle of sight may be at fault for the asymmetric shape however the final graph kind of blows it all away. Even if you could technically build a Dyson sphere, the energy required to get that kind of structure set up is immense. It's probably just a panel, or the beginnings of it. 
As for the rest, I believe they're jumping to the alien conclusion a bit too early, while I do believe there is life in space, I'd rather wait for the SETI report on the matter, but that may as well take a couple years from now, perhaps decades since radio waves are so much slower than light (and that graph is actually 1480 years old!). Still, pretty damn interesting. Let's just hope it wasn't a speck of dirt getting in front of the camera, that'd be a real bummer."
"a professional like me ? some scientist have over-self-confidence, thats why they tend to be beaten by an amateur"
"objects wouldn't need to be orbiting the star to block out it's light(it is strange that the same shaped object appears to cross more than once, but 2 separate and eerily similarly shaped objects would have the same effect). they could just be much closer to us than the star itself, intersecting the light as it crosses between earth and the star. the angle could be as sharp as is possible(just missing us as it passes), the velocity of the object could be massive, and the speed at which it appeared to cross the star could be tiny, just because the angle is so tight.
Also is it possible that an uber freaky asteroid the size of 15 Jupiters and asymmetrically shaped, has fallen into a natural orbit around the star?
Also maybe someone built something huge that orbits the star?
Also maybe the star just has a crooked smile. like an anomalous chemical composition that causes a slice of it to be much darker?
i can't test any of that stuff, might be scientifically implausible to a laughable degree. but it's thought provoking to a relative simpleton like me. for sure. oO"
Mostly Trampanzees here....jejeje
Just because light from this distant star reduces the conclusion go for aliens?! This is far from scientific evidence.
"That was my Titan, I undocked and got ganked..."
conclusion no clue what it is and wont find out in our lifetime
That's why you don't let a woman speak
"How do we know that what's blocking the light is orbiting the star?  It doesn't seem to have a REGULAR period, so we don't know that.  With the dips apparently being intermittent and in an irregular time pattern, it could be any old thing between here & there.  There could be a giant field of meteors, or an old busted up planet, or more likely just clouds of gas & dust that are moving directly across our exact line of sight.  I'm sure there's a simple explanation... Occam's razor and all that."
"It is simpler than it looks, imagine you are looking for a marble passing in front of a torch light, you assume, those marble will orbit the torch light, then came along someone carrying a pebble closer to your eye, passing in front of the torch light."
"Theory lost traction before it was described in the course of the video, went from 10% to 15% 2 years later to 20% 4 years later, no build team could do that... likely an elliptical orbit of a failed binary star (for me; right mass, wrong elements)"
"Let us hope that the ""aliens"" did not see us and think we were spying on them."
The truth is no one has a clue as to what the cause is of the observed dip is. Not a clue. The speaker here provides only guesses as to the cause and probably all are incorrest. I agree with her it's probably has natural causes but what? Aliens? I very much doubt it.
Been listing to this Tabby's star for years and finally I got to realize it's Tabby herself after watching 9 minutes xD

i watch because shes armenian"
"Believe it or not you cant explain everything, and i oppose this lady. She takes herself for granted i guess"
"About this video,  i have one question 
what if those patterns of dip light are some kind of sign language..
like we used morse code ?? 
consider alien is more superior than us n have super advanced technology..
what if they know we at that moment looking to their host star n they give us some signal to try reach us??

"Radiation emanating from Tabby's Dust Ring.

We know that planets such as Jupiter have a ring network that has dust particles along with much larger bunnies that form into small moons. Is there a way to determine how the radiation for each of the four gas giants in our own solar system ""sounds"" based on the radiation being emitted that would then be correlated to radiation type emitted based on each ring networks dust and material composition? 

Is there a way to determine how many volts are present during a non-transit and a transit based on the depth of the dips and the time that each dip takes place that could be then used to determine if a planet is passing through a dust ring around Tabby's Star and becoming negatively and positively charged?

imagine what we could observe and where we could be if we would spend our money on science and not on military and wars. Or if muslim countries would also participate in human development and scientific advancement.
Maybe a star running out of fuel sputtering like an engine?It would explain the star losing it's luminosity over time.What kind of star is it?If it's like our sun a planet full of iron could have fallen into it disrupting it's nuclear integrity.How far away is it?Maybe it's already gone?
"Alright they've had over a year to observe the star, are the aliens coming to destroy the Earth next and that's why we haven't heard anything more?"
"that was just nonsense, half of it was imagination and story telling."
"She looks scared to share this info. NASA probably in the bushes whispering, ""Don't do it Beyotch."""
"I might not understand astro physics enough, but why cant it be a super planet (or very dull brown dwarf star) with orbiting satellites that happened to align well enough with neighbouring planets to cause the gradual block and sudden unblock of light."
"Nothing to see here, folks. Whatever happened, happened 15,000 years ago."
"A possible mistake in logic at 7:40: there doesn't have to be tens of 1000s of comets, just thousand in the same plane, which could happen (?) if they were thrown out of the star's oort cloud by some passing disturbance...?  

But she is being hard on her own hypothesis, so that's actually laudable."
W.O.W.
ITS NIBIRU
It was very (really very) interesting with the signals analysis until she started to mention aliens...mmmmm
I'm guessing she has seen every star in the universe....based on what the title states.
The most mysterious star has to be Charlie Sheen!
Why couldn't the loss of light be caused by the black hole in Cygnus??
"fake!! earth is flat!!





*grab popcorn"
"Stop astronomy , work for Hollywood ..."
a Dyson sphere is a very feasible possibility. But my question if an alien civilization was technologically​ advanced enough to build ships for interstellar travel and the ability to build there sphere wouldn't they be smart enough to create free renewable energy in the amounts they need
"Is this a peak into what is going on in our world? Is this truth hiding in plain sight? Is this them, ""informing"" us? That we have run out of energy and are now trying to harness it from near by places, planets? Is this what has happened to our sun? Why they block our sky? Why the chemtrails? Why the changes in our skies, in our atmosphere, on our planet? There are lies in her words, I see them."
"UPDATE: in May 2017 there was another huge dip in this star's brightness. Astronomers all over the world were alerted during this event, that took days to happen. The dip was consistent with the 'mysterious' characteristics previously observed."
Let assume those are aliens and they are trying to communicate; any thoughts?
ok i thought jupiter was 1100 times bigger than earth? think she said 11 times bigger?
"She is full of bullshit.
1)NASA doesn't build computers.
2)computers doesn't miss something, only their algorithms may be not recognizing that data pattern."
The title is misleading...She's saying 'most mysterious star in the galaxy' and not in the Universe.
Alien body / infrastructure... bigger than Jupiter...
Where can I find her? I have some ideas of what it might be.
"3:20 ""Earth is 11 times smaller than Jupiter?""  What?  I thought Jupiter was more than a thousand times bigger than the Earth."
They have exhausted their resources but they have enough resources to build something that requires unimaginably many resources? WTF indeed
what if there are just gigantic groups of asteroids in the orbit of the star? (they are grouped cause of gravity) I mean sounds a lot more logical to me then aliens LUL
The asymmetric transition can mean that the planet has moon that appears in parallel with the planet when it enters the transition and when it comes out in front of or behind it to the kepler when it exits the transition
Amateur astronomers rock. Thats the best thing about astronomy respect
"Instead of talking about something that nobody else knows about, why don't you look at the ""disco star"" and tell us what that is!?  There are many like the one called disco star but nobody will come forward and talk about it, as if it doesn't exist.  Well, THEY DO exist.  And there are many of them seen all over the world in all points in the sky at all different times of the year.  I suppose this comment will go the way of them all and get lost, never to be seen or looked for ever again!"
"The most mysterious star in the universe | Tabetha Boyajian
no... but in the KNOWN universe, perhapse."
"Why couldn't the anomalous dips in the solar graphs be associated with multiple overlapping planets of various size? Perhaps that solar system contains hundreds of planets, with some of them orbiting in concert (but slightly out of phase) around the star. That would be my first guess, at least ahead of comets, or colliding planets. "
Epliptical orbit perhaps?
it's a astroid belt that has cooled or a broken up planet
8:50....hello?? is this mic on??
"Kinda makes me nervous if there is an advance mega alien structure just floating around out there, like do they know about us? Do they know we're looking at them? Ahhh"
just a lot of debris
"If a Jovian sank into that star and left behind X number of small moons to scattershot around and then return to boil and spew heated dust, what are the odds that enough of them would combine at any one time to produce such an enormous volume of heated dust that it would cause upwards of a 20% dip? Enough dust to cover a surface area roughly the size of scores of Jovians? I just find that nearly impossible to believe."
"it COULD be a cloud of unicorn farts!! Energy needs? We're talking a structure fully encasing a star being the size of MILLIONS of death stars. Even the simplest incarnations of a Dyson Sphere are still on the scale of hundreds of thousands of times the size of the Death Star. Far far bigger than JUPITER. The raw materials would have to come from hundreds or even thousands of star systems and one could assume quickly enough to build a structure. Any civilization capable of traveling to thousands of star systems rapidly would have mastered energy production far beyond nuclear fusion. Antimatter probably. It would take serious fleets of massive ships or some kind of exotic technology to open wormholes and transport giant asteroids or planetoids to get the raw materials. The energy it would take to go to thousands of star systems and haul material many times the size of Jupiter back, not to mention the.labor needed...any civilization capable of this would have long ago mastered energy production and would have no need for solar energy, even a lot of it. They wouldn't do this to their home star, so what...this energy would be transported across the stars?"
Mind blown!!
impossible. there's a dome over us.
so many ppl. i hate stage freight :'(
This data is interesting but please every event that occurs in universe is not because of aliens. Let the alien live...
"My theory is that this is indeed alien technology at work. The aliens are using a massive structure they built around the star that can harvest the star's energy, which is then used to power their hundreds of thousands of warships. These warships are equipped with intergalactic propulsion systems and massive cannons that require tons of energy to power. I am positive these aliens are conquerors and they will soon set their eyes on our sun which will lead them to acknowledge that a planet orbiting the sun has sentient life. It won't be long before our race is either extinct or enslaved."
They are building a wall around the star...
"That must be our future.. when ""we"" ran out of energy supply"
"Cant belive all based their concluision on the keepler fake telescope, no one knows how exactly work and no one explained beside all the cgi images that suppose that shiet look up. All light of planets or stars came to the lens of keepler at the same time the ones are 55Billion light yrs and the ones are 10 light years, how exactly distingish wich one is one?, colors?, 2 super red one 55b one 22b the far one biger the nearest smaller, how to know?, And Why if this keepler can see a tree on a planet We have to conform with low resolution photos of Curiosity rover in Mars?. And how keepler can focus trough a galaxy or nebulusa between the one that have fake exoplanets?, Can any one replay with a video with real explanation and video of the keepler? not cgi or animateds. Untill then all comments are based on a lie, so there is no space just stars on the firmament and maybe no so far from here. GBY."
"If there is an ET civ just 1,000 years ahead of us no matter how far away they are they will or have known about us long before we will know about them. The problem with science is they think they have to have an answer for everything. That guarantees they are wrong about everything.These people still think a star is an isolated ball of the lightest element hydrogen burning at its core and is wrapped around by the heaviest elements. Isn't there something wrong with the physics of the lightest element settling to the core? There are no islands in space everything in space and time are connected, except of course the mind of scientists that is surreal and disconnected to everything. Their opinion isn't worth a glass of piss. Modern science astronomy-priests of big bang religion are ruining it for everyone. Professors of ignorance. Check out Wal Thornhill modern astronomers worst nightmare the Electric universe.Nice shoes Tabby I bet her parents were hippies that liked Bewitched."
new sightings of the same star again some weird thing orbits in front of it
"One premise is advanced that says, ""We felt supercomputers 'missed' something in the analysis of the data...humans are great a pattern recognition (which is true sometimes but not in all cases) and so humans poured over data collected by an instrument (Keplar telescope) which allowed the scientists to observe this unusual occurrence.""  OK.  What if the Keplar telescope 'missed' something during the observation?  Since supercomputers 'missed' something in the analysis of the data, who's to say that data hasn't been corrupted in transmission and capture?  Another question, she mentioned that other anomalies [in the data?] were observed, but doesn't discuss why those were discarded and only KIC 8462852 was selected for further analysis and speculation.  Humm."
"Here is my explanation, I request Ms Tabetha Boyajian to read this (This may help).
They are stars and they have planets orbiting around it, There could be a case where all these planets aligned in such a way that they blocked the light. Why this I think this is the most suitable 
look at our solar eclipse, it blocks the light, and makes an odd shape, and the time of the eclipse is not days or hours, it is just for few minutes. No replace this whole thing with the star we are looking at and its orbiting planet. They blocked our view by aligning in a certain way. what about the size of the planets? they have to be huge to block those stars..... well we are million light years from them, a small rubber ball can block their light from our view on earth, so may be the eclipse didnt happen on the star we are looking at but between earth and that star? 

Whoever is reading this, if you think this all makes sense and you can pass it to Ms. Tabetha Boyajian, I request you to do that. This may give her another perspective."
"Call me a sceptic but I still think it's 2 or more planets. If they all had a dense atmospere,  there wouldn't be that much dust!  Aliens would have had to disassemble several planets to make this thing which speaks for a huge population,  and there's no evidence of radio or light or heat from such a massive civilization."
"Dyson's spheres are impractical, if not impossible.  If we were going to do this to our Sun, there is not enough material in our solar system to build 10% of such a beast.  I can't believe that a serious scientist would consider such a thing."
"The most convincing thing is honestly the way we can conclude that whatever object caused the light to dim is NOT circular. Since gravity is everywhere in space it will cause things to be circular, right? So what it is?"
"We are tiny germs running around upon a piece of dust and nothing is out there. 
We must be smarter than the whole. 
God does not exist."
A bunch of different planets maybe?
"Aliens could be blocking light from other inhabited planet as a weapon against them, if they know we are here they could do the same to us. they could block our sun's energy from us too destroy inhabitants in our part of the Universe. Something destroyed the dinosaurs."
People so unimaginable stupid...
"what about all the stars that must be out there with planets that are orbiting in such a way that they aren't passing between us and the star so we can't see it?

what nationality is ""Boyajian""?"
"What about the idea that it could have been several (or many) planets of varying sizes orbiting this star? And the bigger dips in the light curve could even have been (different?) groups of planets with different revolution times (so at some point during transit some of them align in front of each other, resulting in the unsymmetrical light curve), but their revolution periods are long (like, several hundreds or even thousands years), so it couldn't have been confirmed by repeating results during this short observation period."
Yay once again it s happening
I call cancer in the star
Sigh...you started with science then ended with non-science.
"Yup! It's happening, the Tabby's star is dimming again!"
So Huumons are still good for something lol.
"Has anyone ever considered that you couldn't build a Dyson sphere for this reason, the heat from the power coming to that planet would make the planet to hot just as our computers and power use heats up earth. How much would sending 20 percent of the suns energy to a planet heat up that planet, my thinking is it would make it to hot. Just a thought."
I'm sorry for all this it wasn't for you to see or understand but ..! I do  it just some time I feel lonely   ...... if you understand the TRUTH you knows HIM
I occasionally involve in many project on Zooniverse including  Planet Hunter
More science fiction.
My bet is a chance alignment of several gas giants on one side of the star. Is there no red/blue shift data on this star yet?
Cool news: That star (aka Tabby's star) started to dim again the other day.
100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 light years
presentation was old news and weak at best of interpreting broad thoughts like a bad thesis TED talk let me down but she was in the right direction
That is why we have to send people to Mars! Computers can miss things people pick up...
It is the imperial fleet including the death star
"Why does it have to be one object or one planet? Why cant it be a large group of objects or planets or rotating around different paths creating the anomalies. The chance of objects passing by another object at such a far distance have to be ""astronomical"" she says ""the object"" would have to be 1,000x greater than the size of the earth."
Good heavens do these idiots actually get paid?
"At 6.36 seems obvious to me, many planets are being detected not just one, sometimes you may get one planet passing sometimes a few or many during a time period. That I think would explain the anomalies"
lots of objects moving in an erratic orbit around it....maybe..
"1,000 times the area of Earth, seems Id rule out a megastructure. All seem to be focused on something blocking the light, well maybe nothing is blocking the light & its brightness isn't consistent? like some sort of solar storm or reaction within the star itself? kind of like a flashlight with a bad battery. light fades until you tap it then brightens up again for a bit. just seems to be a star burning out or losing whatever is creating the energy."
2017 transit!!!
Tabby is active yet again!
Like a big saturn planet with a huge ring of dust very close. Dyson sphere yheee right.
It's DIPPING AGAIN NOW people! Boyajian and other astronomers put out the alert this AM (5/19/17). I'm hoping it's really aliens.....
"no, you didn't find planets, you find tiny microscopic fluctuations of light on the order of 1 part in 10 million on your super complicated instrument hurling through space at 20,000 miles an hour."
This is called science these days? A lot of mumbo jumbo and eye rolls...
makes sense of why Stephen Hawking recently said 'don't make contact'.
maybe this star is having technical difficulties in keeping itself glowing ... running out of gas
Obviously it's Bigfoot.
I remember one time when our moon dimmed more than 20% of our star 😅
Tabetha Boyajian is a Charlatan
Scifi movie writers: TAKE NOTES!!
maybe the star is orbiting around a black hole
An alien megastructure... Like the Death Star?
"A perfectly rational explanation that (naturally) no one else has proffered is that the occluding material is a cloud of material that is super-light-absorptive. For example, in recent years man has invented things that are super-light-absorptive (e.g., Vantablack and anti-lasers) from which no virtually light escapes.  There's no rational basis for presuming that equivalently light-absorptive materials do not exist naturally in space."

"Swamp gas, nothing to see here, move along"
"Is it possible that there is not an single object which can appear between Kepler telescope and this star, the distance is so damn huge? So, what would happen if some, much smaller planet or object, or bunch of asteroids, break the line of sight between Kepler and this star? When the Moon blocks the Sun, we could say that the size of the Moon and the Sun is the same, but total eclipse happens because the Moon is so close to Earth and it has just enough size to be able to block the Sun completely..."
"Well as it turns out it WAS an interplanetary war in which one side obliterated the other.
Unfortunately we people of earth in our innocent curiosity have born witness to a crime
of galactic proportion and now a cold alien intelligence turns its baleful eye towards our little blue planet in the distance."
"Very fascinating,"
"Some advanced species actually move their populations out to megastructures to live instead of agreeing to become demon-filled and genociding them from every direction: air; water; soil; food; lack of food; drugs; vaccines;...poison in everything; directed energy weapons like from a grid of giant, fake cell towers every 1/4 mile, each capable of murdering all life for 40+ miles; man-made pandemics; ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++"
The cadence all TED speakers talks is similar and boring.
that star is now a sun 10 million light years out in the next solar system dont believe we are causing global warming everyting going hay wire is cause that son is recharging ours no ice age
"couldn't it just be a normal planet system, which cause the strange luminosity curve because of the inter-planet interaction?
if comets are possible, then why not planets?
I mean it can also be observed in our own solar, when the eight planets lined up, or the leading jupiter drags the saturn so saturn is (relatively) suddenly faster
"
"It might be a dying star, rotating very slow with a big portion of its  surface so cold that it barely produces any light, that blackened surface  would be an irregular changing shape."
Some idiots will send 'hello' to this star; and the Galactic Nomadic Army will soon come our way.
"what about black holes or a similar phenomenon that can bend light? when ""dysen spheres?"" seem more interesting 😊"
you do have to remember though if a race got that advanced that they built one a Dyson sphere around there sun it wouldnt give off a lot of heat because heat is a energy source and they would be using that all so with a high enough intelligence at least at that level of one all forms of energy wouldnt be wasted but used and transferred to areas to be processed meaning we would never see a high area of heat on it because any indication of high heat would be a waist of energy that could be converted to usable power
It were go
It is hard for me to imagine that even NASA's computers could not detect the massive changes depicted by the graphs that she showed.  Something is amiss here.

"We're presuming the occlusions are being caused by bodies in rotational orbit around KIC 8462852.
Could it be large irregularly shaped bodies traveling obliquely and linearly between us and KIC 8462852 (and tumbling) ?

"All the planets around that star will align at sometime. They will shade , hide the star to a certain extent. This will take hundreds oaf years to observe."
Aliens building a protective-shield vs killer asteroids?!
What a bullshit. Com'onnnn!! On TED??
"Before she revealed the theories, I was hoping that we were witnessing a star that is orbiting a black hole just as it was about to be swallowed up,  and that is why the light dips are distorted from the normal shape and why there is a whole lot of dips just near the end of the data transmission.  I can only think of one reason why this theory might not be true and that is if a star were that close to a black hole, we would probably not see near as much light escaping towards us in the first place.  (keep in mind, I barely remember astronomy 101)"

Hopefully the James Webb Space Telescope will give us more insight about this star in 2018.
"It's not aliens, it's probably some kind of interstellar object, maybe a rogue planet that every now and then comes in between Earth and the star but is very far from the star itself, thus it's ""transit"" takes up more angular distance relative to an observer on earth than it normally would. It could even be a nearby black hole or other massive object that either is bending light away from earth erratically or actually pulling material from the star."
"By the rules of logic, sagan's quote at the beginning, is actually illogical. Who is to declare whether something is extraordinary? And who is to decide whether the evidence meets a particular standard? This statement is used to set the bar high for claims that fall outside of the ordinary paradigm of science. Evidence is evidence, and a claim is simply a claim, just because a claim seems extraordinary, does not mean that you have to have extraordinary evidence for it to be scientifically valid, or to build a hypothesis worth testing. While I greatly respect Sagan, and watched his Cosmos series when it first came out, this quote has caused a great deal of trouble for people putting forth new claims, and allowing those who disagree with them to attack them simply by calling them extraordinary."
Earth moon theory at 7:00 ....... really Honey ?
"Tabetha is looking sexy with her hair pulled up. You go girl, talking about aliens and death stars."
"if they couldn't explained that phenomenon, why they referred it to aliens, which is unexplainable thing.
so, what is the alien?"
"Here's a fun thought: It's all about perspective, right? For example, our moon, a tiny wisp of a thing compared to our star, can block 90% starlight from the perspective of the planet bound life between the Moon and the Earth. The rays cast by KIC8462852 could be dis-proportionally intersected in a similar way if we observed objects in transit in interstellar space, say outside KIC's heliosphere, but not close enough to us to disrupt starlight of surrounding stars. Additionally, the asymmetrical curves suggest either thrust applied in the trajectory (aliens), or a non-spherical object which was on a trajectory near enough to our angle of observation to present a slow ""sunset"" in the example curve given at first, while its cliff like other edge didn't obscure the light nearly in the same way. So, we're looking at an interstellar debris field, (explaining the 20% drop), or an interstellar transit or trade route, through which ships of varying sizes transit far enough from KIC to have exaggerated shadows, with sufficient course-adjustment to suddenly move out of the stellar transit to Earth in abrupt fashion once they are far enough from the heliosphere. So - could this be supernova remains of an asteroid field, where interstellar history would be necessary to explain the planetary debris? or could it be a new race, capable of interstellar stations parked outside their home star's heliosphere, and we just happen to be positioned on the other side of one of their colonized worlds and their interstellar port?? Is there enough data to run some model examples of an object at some distance from the star, from our vantage point? Because, if it's not a Dyson Sphere (and it likely isn't), then what we're likely dealing with is a very strange (possibly unique in the case of natural explanation) interstellar transit of some non-periodic matter."
"What if it's a star that's in its death throes? Like a dying light bulb, it's flickering about, until it transitions into a dimmer state. We've been able to observe Supernovae after the star blew up, but do we have pictures of stars transitioning from a bright star to a less bright phase?"

"Planets in conjunction.  Could happen every 5 year, could happen every thousand years, hundred thousand years....keep watching it.  Doesn't seem like a mystery to me.  Just reverse the observation.  What if aliens on another planet were observing our sun and 5 or more planets were in conjunction between us?  What if this solar system has two or more large planets and they are not on the same plane?  Yes, we can see the one planet on our plane but the other(s) might not come back into that conjunction for...a long...long...time."
Maybe it's a stellar singularity passing by having a feast on all the planets in the system?
"One of the thoughts that I had is that the spikes might be explained by a smaller sun that is surrounded by hundreds of planets, who vary extremely in size, and orbital planes, whose orbits form complex interweavings.   So that, from the 2-dimensaionl 'plane view'  we observe from the earth, we've not had the time, not the dimensional ability, to see the 'whole' of these complexities.  
Maybe we are like the 2-dimensional being that lives on the surface of a sheet of paper, who trys to describe 'thickness'.  ie - ""What's that?"""
What if there's a big anomaly on the star's surface and it's shown once every 2 years by it's own spinning movement?

Lol wtf
"Sorry for being lame but rather than thinking of Aliens proposition it could be simple as binary star something similar to pluto and sharon, and considering the fact that we are measuring luminosity of that star through asteroid belt and the kupier belt, the variation of the dip could be explained because of the obstacles it has to pass through."
or it could be any number of things floating in the vastness of space in our line of sight with this star (no aliens needed)
I hope this one of the candidates that the James Webb Space Telescope (2018) will be looking closer at.
thanx to the amateur astronomers for providing an alternative to the NASA and main stream observations and explanation of stars and so called planets
The amount of energy needed to build such a sphere would be most of that produced by the star. Has no-one thought about space clouds between here and there?
do all presenters have a speech impediment?
This star was discovered by two men. She was only the supervisor on the project.  She gets all the credit and the star named after her (which is unheard of in astronomy) because feminism.
"You know, as someone who really, really loves science and big unanswered questions, I think it's pretty stupid to patronize a hypothesis that isn't proven to be wrong.

The reapers... are here
"Could that be multiple planet orbiting and passing between kepler and the star at the ""same"" time. Instead of comets, planets ? And planets maybe have satelite too. Id like to go further on this hypotesis... (planets dont have same speed, and we observe an almost perfect  alligment of planets)"
Is it possible to determine the shape of the object having as data this signal?
and we will nvr know the truth
errm just to be clear. the suggestion is an alien civilasation with a serious energy crisis on thier hands somehow have the neccessary energy to build a colasal superstructure in space. makes no sense. also built out of what? ie if we on earth had said energy problem and i said lets build a solar panel the size of 5 jupiters surely your obvious question would be well since earth is a tenth the size of jupiter where are we getting all this metal. also solar collection is at best an uneffective method of energy collection hence needing a structure that large all be it impossible to build given previous reasoning. surely say mining jupiter for hydrogen would be a better solution before construction of the solar death star  as for why the dip in light. is it possible the star just has fluctuation in the light it puts out. i dunno it should at least make sense  right.
Why can't it just be more than one planet?
"so i heard ""now we have to find a way to rule out alien structures""? where's the flux"
"extraordinary claims require definitive evidence not ""extraordinary evidence"". 
just for the record"
Wonder how big the greatest sunpsots can get...
Its lightyears away... there's doubtless heaps of crud flying around out there between the star and the reciever... any of those would create those anomolous shading events.
"I think i know why.
She said the planet in question is a very large one right , so it is only logical to assume that if it had any natural satellites , they too would be comparably large. Take Ganymede for example, it is the largest moon and  the ninth largest body in our solar system and ofc it orbits Jupiter, the largest planet.
So what if, the dips we observe are as a result of the  multiple large satellites that orbit this giant planet around the star KIC 8462852.
So if this planet with such large satellite/satellites were to pass in front of the star from earth's (or Kepler's point of view), we would first see the dip from the satellites, followed by that of the planet, then followed by another dip from other satellites, which is consistent with the data shown in the video.

Isn't this a more logical explanation than alien superstructures or a hail of comets?"
"I am just a space enthusiast but  when she said it could be thousands to tens of thousands of comets hurdling inward torwards the star I thought of planet 9 at its closest approach to our sun and its gravity effecting our keipler belt or if far enough out ourt cloud, wouldn't this be enough to cause possibly tens to hundreds of thousands of comets to do this? Not to mention with all the stars having atleast one planet or more shouldn't this happen somewhere? No scientist just wondering?"
Couldn't this be an irregular variable? I thought that variable stars could have changes in brightness of this magnitude that are caused solely by conditions inside the star.
"The Dyson sphere idea is very interesting. I can't bring myself to believe that it's some crazy space battle, but maybe it's a Dyson sphere. However, I don't think the comet swarm argument is ""weak."" Yes, the probability of that many comets orbiting a star at once is very low, but considering that we've observed billions of stars, it's bound to occur in at least one of them."
"Why can't it just be a planet 1,000 times bigger than earth? Is it just sitting there and not orbiting the star?"
"It seems like they should have observed the pattern longer to get more data.  However, it seems like there must have been multiple simultaneous planetary transits to have that kind of reduction in light.  And what about the shapes of their orbits?  What if the planets don't have near perfect eccentricity like Earth?  Perhaps these ideas don't explain what the phenomenon, but from my perspective the ideas should have been discussed and/or refuted."
"As a Citizen Scientist myself, this kind of video excites my mind to the fullest!!!"
"I love that legitimate scientists are so anguished by suggesting that something might be aliens that they will refuse to even consider that and instead suggest that its a random giant swarm of comets that is so unlikely that its a bit of a joke. yes there could certainly be a natural explanation for this but we could also be on the very precipice of having the ability to notice alien activity here and we are too afraid to speak those words. In 50 years we may be at a point where ""alien infrastructure"" is a yawn inducing fact of the universe. oh look theres another ancient dysons swarm..."
"has anyone thought maybe its caused by objects much smaller and much closer, than planets orbiting that star?  like a rock in our kuiper belt, or some rouge planets that just happened to cross the path of kelpers veiw, the odds are small but space is huge..."
"The comments ended up with people blabbing about the earth being flat. . . somehow.  Not sure where the sun goes at night or the moon, but them both being circles and all (not spheres mind you. . . circles), I guess we just happen to all be facing the flat sides of each other.  Luck!!

At least the comments aren't filled with comments about her being a woman and being hot or not.  I guess we are making progress!!  Terrific presentation!!

BTW, how did Sennheiser get the exclusive mic equipment contract on TED talks?  - Oh, answered myself as I was typing:  Sure lapel mics need to clip on a shirt or suit and folks are wearing all kinds of stuff so a head-mounted mic solves that problem.  Smart folks."

"KIC 8462852 is almost 1,500 light years away, which means that if aliens do inhabit that solar system and they're looking at Earth right now, they'd be witnessing the dawn of the Middle Ages. Science is crazy."
"Everyone seems to the talking only about a 'body' orbiting the target star. What about all the space between us measuring the starlight and the actual star. Something could be passing between us anywhere here, ie not associated with the star."
"I was expecting that she will say it is a black hole in highly elliptic orbit ... but she quoted aliens and last i watched the news, one person is treating humans as aliens ... so no it is not aliens  ;p"
It's never aliens.

There is nothing as practical as a good theory!
Perhaps it is a very small black hole orbiting the star. *shrug*
"Hum..multiple planet paths crossing at the same time, maybe??  seems more plausible than Aliens"
"1. A previously unobserved form of star-Acne.
2. Wrinkles in the space between us.
3. The system is over populated with migrant planets.
4. Trump is testing his wall's effectiveness.

5. Last but the least, it is a binary star system with both stars semi-aligned in our line of observation. The dip in light intensity is during full alignment, increase due to misalignment of the twins.

If Aliens can expend resources to build objects with 1000 earth diameters instead of a new planet, than it must be a form of trans-warp corridor.

Nanu Nanu"
Need more data.
The strange light dips could be caused by a group of large planets orbiting in conjunction of each other closely to the star.
"All this and she never even brought up the fact that we should obviously start by finding how close those objects were to the star, before what and how big? Odd way to go about it, but I'm not exactly going to say wrong just yet...."
"Take all this with a grain of salt. If there is alien life out there, and they are supremely intelligent, no one can say for certain that they would create a dyson sphere; that is a hypothetical born out of a human mind. BTW- they call it a dyson sphere because it's bullshit any way you look at it."
I'm looking forward to the update on this!
THIS TALK IS GREAT AFTER A BREAK UP
That's Tabby of Tabby's Star.  Whoa.
Earth is flat and you are looking at lights in the sky with no clue what they are.
We should stop doing war because there will be Alien coming soon ( Stephen Hawking said: The probability of Alien coming soon is low)
Multiple planets with multiple moons. Sometimes the orbits overlap and collectively block our view causing irregular dips. Maybe...
"Couldn't it be a huge meteor shower traveling between Earth and the star and much closer to Earth than to the star?
It's pretty difficult to imagine anyone building something as huge as Jupiter: beside the time effort...where do they take the raw material to begin? Do they mine several planets to build a brand new one? This is the less scientific lecture I heard from Ted talks...and even if I consider it under a science fiction profile, it's still crappy."
"she is actually trying to tell ous that , they found alien mega structure , which is actually alien made."
"retards , they are watching objects from the past , useless eaters of the human kind , they think that they have discovered stars and planets looking at the light that came from them , not one ""professional astronomer "" remember that all they see does not exist anymore in our present the way they see it ..."

The sun is going behind weird moving things. Simple. They are all really fat because they have a totally over the top obesity problem. BEWARE... it's going to happen to us. All the fat buggers will block out the sun...AAARRGGHH!!!
What we are the egg that cracks to revel the chick that is artificial intelligence
Has anyone considered a close pass by a rogue planet disrupting the OORT cloud?  The disruptions could look very random. The mass of comets could follow the planet into the system. Busting up as gets closer to the star would put lots of blockage into the system.
"Imagine, if you will, planets orbiting a distant star.  

First, for us to detect a light dip, they have to pass directly between said star and Earth.

Second, for us to detect a pattern, we'd have to observe the star for several decades.  Why? Because of the fact that there are likely multiple planets around each star. Jupiter orbits in about 12 years. Saturn in about 30 years. Uranus and Neptune, 84 and 165 years.  So, in reality, how many ""light dips"" would you need to detect to be able to determine which dip is which planet and how many planets there are? That equals a LOT of time observing.  How long has the Kepler mission been going? Yea... not nearly enough time.

Third, so, there's this alien race who is running out of energy. The problem is so great that they need to build insanely huge structures to put in orbit around their star. These structures would be thousands of times larger than the very planet they live on.  Where, exactly, are they getting the physical material to build the structures? Energy crisis, remember? If they completely disassembled their entire planet to create the structures, there still wouldn't be enough mass from all their planetary material to build even a tiny ""Dyson Sphere.""

Anyone that explains things with ""it must be aliens"" is an unintelligent fool.

How about this for an explanation....

1. There are billions of miles of empty space between us and this star. Oh, wait... I lied.  The space isn't empty.  There is plenty of gas and dust clouds that move around in space.  They can't be predicted because they can't be seen until they block light from something behind them.

2. The light dips are a combination of planets, comets, and gas-dust clouds.  We simply have not been able to observe for a long enough time to see true patterns so there are a ton of possible explanations that are feasible.  Except aliens of course. That's just a scape-goat for the weak minded."

its obviously the death star
"My bad. I read way too far down the comment thread. The repeated stupidity overwhelmed the few thoughtful posts and now my face and palm are worn out. 
Do not read if you hope is to find useful speculation. There is some, but it's buried."
Zzzzzz........
"If there are large (presumably massive) objects crossing the light path between Earth and this star, they should induce a significant wobble in the star's position. Has anyone looked at finding a wobble, and if so, is there any correlation with this and the Kepler data?"
WTF ???!!!
"Not an expert, so bare with me.  We are looking at a star 1460 light years away and measuring dips in the amount of light we pick up to determine the size of the object blocking the light.  I think that makes sense if we assume an object is in orbit at a specific distance (assumed closer to the star than to our telescope). An object 500 light years from the star would block more light than an object the same size 100 light years away from the star.  Likewise,  dust particles right in front of the telescope lens could block out even more light. than a planet.  I assume each anomaly is then reviewed against a photo as well or something?"
Brainwashing at its finest.
Star is old and unstable...
"Sad how scientists have to lie saying my money is on the natural thing - when we know she really thinks is a Dyson sphere. But if she says that she will be out of a job.

"I found it a bit strange that she could hypothesize that the planet ""ran out of energy"" and they had to ""look elsewhere"" yet she immediately follows up with ""building enormous strucrures in space"". Hello, having run out of energy? How'd they do that?"
Sometimes I wish that the so called Aliens would go around abducting and probing the scientists to convince them of their existence. It seems that unless Aliens are biting and eating scientist there will never be any revelation on that theory.
"so...why can't whatever is blocking the light be just closer to us, then it wouldn't be as huge as they think it is. I mean, couldn't some sort of space gas or something be passing in front of our field of view causing the starlight to dim?"
"is it not possible that we are getting a glimpse of future human technology?  how many light years away, and how far off are we from the technology to travel such distances with relative haste?  is it possible that its future us?"
"...analyzing the data, it would appear that all solar systems are just giant incubators for the planets, which are really eggs , which house giant space chickens, kept warm by The Sun/stars,  'til their hatched."

"This is hilarious!! So based on dimmed light from a star in data, an actual result could be interplanetary space battles more massive and destructive than a 1000 Jupiters that could wipe away all of earth and creation like debris in a hurricane, and make our atomic weapons not worth a wet fart to the aliens waging war in the cosmos."

One giant planet + 2 Moons. That explains the shape and 3 interruptions on 3rd pass. Moons don't have to be in the same position every time while orbiting the planet & star. It could be also a giant planet with an asteroid belt (like Saturn) and 2 Moons...
"Lady, you suggest some really strange explanations.   May I give a simpler one?
That is that whatever this gigantic object is, it could be in a retrograde orbit at the time of observation.  And subsequent observations are its planets in very close proximity."

The Most mysterious star in the Universe. Really? Tell me why the known stars have never gone from view or at least moved, in all recorded history? You believe that the Earth is revolving around the Sun (it does not). You also believe that the Sun is towing the solar system (which does not exist) around the Milky Way galaxy at 220 km/s (although you feel nothing)  and yet after say one thousand years the North Star Polaris is still in the same spot it was in the days of Pythagoras,, so is every constellation. It should appear that they've have moved too, IF the Earth is moving.

"I think the star is intruiging because its a puzzle to be solved. Why is the data having such dips? How can we observe the star in more detail, and get more variety of data from it. The possibilty that it could be a Type II civilization building a Dyson Swarm/Sphere. If proven would be a major discovery. If there are indeed artificial megastructures obriting a host star. Then given their level of technology and scientific knowledge. They may have come up with a solution with regard to heat signature. 

Also regarding S.E.T.I. not finding alien signals as per their own guidelines. Have they ever considered that proposed aliens of a Type II civilization. Could be using methods of communicating that we are unable to detect at present. Or are they to narrowly focused and maybe needing to broaden their approach to detecting signals."
I am afraid that only people with brains think they are the only ones who have all the knowledge. If you open your tent in the middle of a Forrest and just stick your head out and declare that there is no one else around....aren't you the limited minded person?......to assume that without GREAT exploration and definitive proof that we are the only great mind(s) in the entire known galaxy is asinine to say the least.......Just because your colleagues tell you that you are smart does not mean that is true......

"Fascinating and well presented, but we're looking at a tiny part of our own galaxy and we find ""the most mysterious star in the universe""? No point in looking anywhere else then."
"My only problem with dyson spheres is how much material would be consumed just to build a single ring around the star. even if it's a dwarf star, wouldn't it take more than a solar system's worth of material to construct it? And another thing would be, how to keep it from collapsing while it's being built."
She lost me at Dyson Spheres.
A civilization that's run out of energy would not the enormous energy necessary to built a Dyson Sphere. Catch-22.

What a waste of time. If she only knew what she was really looking at. All the sheep are excited.
"could be a system of planets that happens to be moving closer toward the keplar sat. this would explain the increase in dept with the drops on the graph, because every year the system gets closer to the sat lens, blocking more light than before, thus appearing bigger in size. The radical portion nearing the end of the of the keplar mission, may be a reflection of the other planets or moons in the said system, causing multiple obstructions and drops in the light graph data. Its obvious that solar systems do not sit still, they, like our planets are in a continuos orbit in this universe as well. Just my theory though. Good video."
It is my micro penis bending light and time space
"What crappy ""science"".  This is why you can't give intellectuals too much money to play with because they piss it away with ridiculous logic.  She herself said that the leap to aliens should be a last resort.  What if the object is not spherical?  Maybe it is a big flat disc and is spinning and rotating in a strange way?  Andt why is blocked starlight the only possible answer in her mind to reduction in received light to the Earth?  What if the star is dying and having huge variances in its light output as it struggles against gravity and with its dwindling fuel supply?  What if a black hole is redirecting the light instead of a planet with large alien structures on it.  She's too emotional, imagining wild things and coming up with preposterous, outlandish scenarios to hide her own lack of careful and thoughtful analysis.  I'm not saying there are no aliens.  I am saying that this has got to be the weakest potential evidence of them that I have ever seen."

"KIC 8462852 is a crap name which shows a distinct lack of imagination from these extraterrestrials. Seriously, what kind of self respecting alien would call his/her planet KIC 8462852?

"What a facetious, fundamentally unprofessional talk - and I'm disappointed in the people who are taking this seriously.  A ""ginormous solar panel"" (""yay!  I'm a grown-up talking about science in a hip style suitable for small children! I'm the proof that ladies are super serious scientists too, like omigosh!"") - i.e., Dyson sphere - would obviously produce more regular dips in the light.  There are many explanations that are more plausible - by orders of magnitude.  For example, the star being unstable and fluctuating in its energy output, or asteroids or other unobserved objects - perhaps many, not related to each other - moving between us and that star.  Jumping to ""aliens,"" I suppose, is titillating; and certainly a bunch of people who are too clever by half will preen and imagine themselves to be open-minded, curious and fascinating people, for their willingness to take it so seriously.  But, on what little evidence is produced here, it strains credulity and is proof of the casual frivolity that is now so common in the ""scientific"" community."

"She's saying little, using many words. Dyson spheres, aliens, star wars aso. But I would like to know what if anything prevents the observations simply suggesting big planets with many moon - or even several smaller planetary systems circling a big star - from being the possible cause of the dibs."

Very funny. I do not believe in aliens. But you know the crazy thing about us people is that we always think the so called aliens are more civilized than us. But have you ever thought us human might also be more civilized than the other so-called forms of life? If at all there is any that is.

"What about 2 binary planets orbiting each other revolving around the star, and the planets are in different positions when they transit the star?"
"What if there are more than one planets of different sizes in different orbits revolving around the star, but during the observation, some of them maybe 2, maybe 3 or maybe more came in front of the star at the same time, not aligned in a line but close enough that they can all block the light coming from star at different points. Also if the planets must be at different speeds as they are revolving in different orbits and so this created a weird shape when observed which was not circle and hence the first weird data. As no other theory can explain different shape of planets other then circle as at the mass so heavy of a planet, it has got to be circle. 
And as they are revolving very close to each other (not the distance between the orbits but the lateral distance between them when observed, that next time they completed an full orbit they were all aligned and this can explain the big drop.

Again the next time they passed from the front of the star again due to there different speeds the alignment got distorted and hence the weird data again. 
Also the time is not regular between the orbit, this can be because they are in eliptical orbits and are close enough to complete orbit in this amount of time. Or it can also be possible that the first ones are not same as the second ones or third ones.

Hundreds or thousands of comets theory can be partially true or it can be that with planets, comets also came to cover parts of star with planets and hence increase the drop even more."

Maybe it's a smaller star orbiting it? since whatever is blocking KIC is bigger than a planet..
They witnessed an alignment of planets.

what if its something local... like in the oort cloud blocking the light?
If these aliens ran out of energy than where did they get the energy to build these structures?

"Dozens of alien civilizations are already out there, and we have been directly visited, thought, manipulated and helped by one of them in ancient times in Egypt and Mexico. We live in an area of the universe that’s not so much of an interest for other civilizations rather than one that “handles” us. Those who visited us left us for now until a few thousand years. Other civilizations know we exist and know who “owns” us. This is why they left us only for them. The elites among us know this and they are in constant contact with the aliens. Whenever any out-of-control discovery leads to those aliens the elites use their giant media and money machine to disinform us. And the battle of our curiousity vs. their interest to keep us disinformed is on."
their technology could look like magic to us. we are still in the stone age compared to a race that has mastered space flight. the laws of physics could be very loose guidelines to an advanced race. it makes more sense to look
"Fascinating talk but what's up with her strident, slam poetry-like cadence and diction?  Has Social Justice culture infiltrated the hard sciences too?"
"Right, the plant is being pulled in by the gravity of the sun. Would make sense if the planet has more dips over time spinning quicker and quicker around the orbit of the star."
"Crap, why didn't she mention giant monster flying in front of the star waving its wings? Or maybe - this is my personal favorite - alien civilization switching the star off for a short maintenance work. C'mon these ideas are terrible. I'd say let's wait for some explanation that has some support in data *and* makes sense."
So why haven't you sent a Telescope to look at it?
why would they build around a star??? for energy.... But what would they use so much energy for ?? what battery could hold so much charge.
it has a much simpler explication but science is being biased and lost it s way by pseudo theories and it needs to come back to logics

"I'm embarassed at actual scientists even suggesting that this is an alien mega structure. And to compound that by suggesting it could be a Dyson Sphere (a totally impossible structure to even mine resources for let alone build) actually smacks of stupidity.
This anomoly is certainly a natural one, and could be any number of things that would be a million times more likely than a Dyson Sphere.
It could be multiple brown dwarfs orbiting the star, interstellar dust/clouds passing across our view,  or dark matter getting in the way, who knows. 
But please drop the Dyson sphere bollocks. The idea doesnt even make any sense. She admitted that herself when she said a civilisation uses up all its resources, so it builds a dyson sphere to gather maximum energy from the star. Slight contradiction in there, no resources = no build ANYTHING"
"What if it is something passing nearer us but much more littler. Wouldn't it produce the same results?I don't know if it's possible, but if it is, it can be simply explained with the Thales theorem...
So it could be a natural object.
Why not something that turns around the sun, with it's rotation plan aligning itself more and more with the line passing by the star and the Earth...
That also could explain the increasing reduction of light, each time it passes in front of us."
"Just 2 notes (don't get me wrong, I'm a foil-hat dumbass but still...)
- ""Aliens or natural explanations""...An other civilization, who is more advanced than us cannot be a ""natural explanation""?
- ""Even alien megastructures cannot defy the laws of physics"" What if they don't? We already have many everyday stuff (cellphones, aeroplanes etc) that ""defy the laws of physics""...from the perspective of a less advanced being, such as a human 200 years ago."
she looks like drew barrimore at first glance
I still think it was a gas giant or a brown dwarf with a large ring
4:15 Louis Theroux !
Mind-blowing!
It's a giant cocoon. The insect aliens are builing a cocoon around their star.

"She's very lucky to see a PLANET IN THE MAKING in real time. She's seeing the bombardment of countless space object's at one central point causing that massive dust cloud to be in motion.  star light penetration of a very dark dust cloud at a billion miles away come's out on the other side as a star , it could be as bright as the morning sun if not blocked. This is very visible here on earth seeing our sunlight penetration of cloud opening's with a bright shaft of light then the light gets dimmer as the cloud's come's togather blocking out the light shaft. Tabby's star is a light shaft as many other's are, white dwarf's, red dwarf's, binary stars, alfa centuri binary system in reality is a one star system.  The distance between these two star's is claim to be about two billion mile's apart. If  this is true ! It's not possible to see them as individual's because the light of each star would join with the next overriding the darkness between them , making it impossible to see them as separate star. This is another light shaft mistaken for a star. Visit YOUTUBE SUNLIGHT ELECTRO RAY'S visible showing planetery orbit's powered by sunlight energy not gravity. Lol"
dont get the point of this to be honest. iam not taking anything away from the scientists and their skill and knowledge but the reality is this is complete waste of time and money..it achieves nothing and who really cares..over a thousand light years away..what? not achievable distances to travel even if we could travel at the speed of light which isnt possible...money could be  used elsewhere for better things..perhaps cancer cures or hospitals and schools...stuff like that..dyson spheres?? just pathetic idea..
The most mysterious star... in the Kepler observed patch of space
Could it be some hardware on the Kepler craft degrading or breaking?
Couldn't the odd non symmetric dips be caused by giant moons orbiting the planet?

stupid sci fi lies no such things as spacetravel or aliens you nerds kill me with your bs just as bad as muslims
What if the star is so dense that it is creating an unusual bulge on the large planet in it's orbit? Maybe the planet is orbiting really close to the star and the planets enormous size results in this bulging phenomena at a proximity that close to a dense star with a strong gravitational attraction.
"no necesitan generar calor porque puede que estén captando impulsos como el motor hd driver que es una forma de "" surfing cósmico "" que no produce calor"

rubbish science for non-thinkers
"I guess nobody ever heard of sunspots?  So these are really big.  If this star were nearby and bright, it would be called an irregular variable."
"So guys, a long long time ago in a galaxy far far away a mass destruction weapon called the Death Star is used to destroy a planet, shattering its debris all around and blocking large amounts of the star's light. 
I knew it was real!"
Whats truly amazing is the assumptions we assume are facts...
These scientist are so far out to lunch find things that make a difference too humanity
"my question would be, don't you think that nasa program was hiding this data? hmmm"
Can we please stop getting the Ancient Nordic Peoples Live In The Center Of The Earth ads at the beginning of our science videos please?
i used to believe but this is just a fairytale ...i mean our imagination for sure is great but ...when you put your logig to it....you hear a good story for hope that the think its something and from a signal they did make a virtual reality and they did make it that there is something but ....we dont know what....sience is proof not a fairytale ...and since ive opened my mind these stories look kind of foolish to me......
"I bet the star is in its infancy,or a rouge planet very far from the star blocking our view"
what about the oort cloud? can these asteroids do this interstellar eclipse?
I can block the sin with muy thumb. Does it mean my thumb is the size of the sun? ...... How do you know the distance of the blocking object from the star?
"In the end she sais ""This star would have never been found by computers because we were just not looking for something like this"". Well that sounds a little weird to me. Clearly there is an abnormality in the data that a computer could recognize as such? If it doesn't fit into a previously determined category, don't they have a folder named ""other""?"
"What if these anomalies are produced by objects from space, which did not orbit around that star? It is a fairly large distance and the possibility that an object trajectory in space to intersect with the visual field is still quite high. I think it is quite plausible that the fluctuations of light to be generated by other objects in space, but not orbiting around the star."
Meh
"Should be ""in the observable universe"". THE UNIVERSE is pretty big."

I just clicked on the video to comment on your title. IN THE UNIVERSE?!!! Do you know all the universe? I'm out.
"what if, is a new ring of asteroids  formation..? or probably not that big planets crossing right at from of the telescope line with the star, on a different distance from it, (like we covering the sun with a finger)...?"
What about Dark Matter Clouds?
And so the nyan cat was discovered
"no radio signals are received from this star/planet, hence it's highly unlikely that any ETs are present. sorry"
Fantastic really enjoyed this
amazing. I hope its a dyson sphere:)
"What if the star is revolving around a black hole? It would distort the light rays such that some rays would get bent and their trajectory would totally change to some place else and the rest go back to earth. Also, since black hole's pull is quite significantly larger than any star's, the star's orbit could be very very large and that's why probably we can see a 20% intensity drop for around a 100 days."
"- What if a black hole passing the star
- What if the star contains thousand of planets where hundreds of them passing the star in groups
- What if meteors from our solar system covering up the light from the star
- etc... etc...
I mean if that's an alien system planet... then why we can't catch their artificial electromagnetic waves?"
whoah so many subtitle
"Sounds like the ebb-tide of a star's energy expenditure at a critical point in the star's life, moreso than an unexplaned random light obstruction. My humble thought."
"Good point: "" an alien technology that we don't understand"". Now we're talking."
"For all the Christians out there, did the bible say that aliens don't exist? Because I've read genesis, and there is no mention of such creatures, but then it never said anything about it not existing. 🤔"
could it be a black hole distorting the star's light?
"These are solar surface events not transit just huge dark spot irregularities as this particular star
Is unstable."
ok first not saying it is aliens. but if a race got that advanced to build a Dyson Sphere to harness more energy then they would have all ready known that heat is another energy source and  instead of letting that heat energy escape and be wasted they would have built in to the Dyson system a method of capturing and using that heat energy which means we wouldn't find the heat signature of it do to the heat being used
its dysonsphere
"Science is the search for truth and so scientists must of course look for the simplest answers before invoking fantastic explanations like aliens, but they need to be smarter about how they go about this. Humans have a hard time supporting things unless they have a direct benefint,or it captures their imagination and you only need to look at the dismal funding of NASA and science in general to see the truth of it. The scientific community dismisses those things that easily captures the publics imagination and thereby misses a great opportunity to increase not only interest in science, but important funding and support."
Lots of people are saying they believe it's planets but the data showed that the irregular pattern within the light dips ruled that out..... unless there's a triangular shaped planet in which case I'm packing my bags and heading out to find it
it's a big piece of swiss cheese
Dark Star
"the Electric Universe theory and plasma physics explains this star easily, as well as all other unexplained or anomalous discoveries..."
how many alien is a question...OK.  thanks
Could it possibly be Donald Trump's hair?
i want to beleive
a school of very large space whales...next question please!
worst shill ever
Must it be a massive object near the star? Why not a smaller object or objects significantly more distant from the star? Is there a proportional gravitational wobble from a transition of something massive acting on its gravity?
Starspots.
"Very interesting talk, many thanks."
Like Skywalker just nuked the Deathstar what do you all expect?
NASA knows about Aliens maybe Also knows about What Aliens are on that Star system .That is why they First Ignored the Data given by the other Science enthusiasts but later thought maybe its better to start giving little details as Aliens secrets soon will  become public as Earth is already facing an Alien invasion or Extinction level threat

Fantastically wonderful
Why you talk too much dear lady??? :(
"no aliens are real, she just doesn't won't to admitted. I call bs."
what if two planets are passing at the same time partially overlapped
"We know so little...
Yet."
"I, for one, would like to welcome our new alien overlords."
"it's light years away, reality may not be so fascinating, highley unlikely to see stuff like Dyson sphere just like in imagination of scientists.. imagine if there actually is an alien civilization capable of harnessing energy from stars,they might already have found us and would have reached here with their high-end Tech... wait...may be they r on the way..."
REAPERS.
This is so inspiring & brilliant!
Maybe it's the train car Voltron.  It would explain the dips in intensity and waning power.
It would be amazing if it was Aliens. However..if one carefully considers such implications it would also be terrifying.
"11:22 ""Another idea that is one of my personal favorites, is mass annihilation of an alien species."" Wow. OK, only slightly sadistic?"
"Keep to the facts, keep scanning for more data and don't make all these wild and premature assumptions about the cause of the dip in light strenght."
Hurr durr. I'll never get these 14 minutes back.
"I want to start by saying I am no where near as knowledgeable as many people on this board, so forgive my ignorance if I'm way off on this.  What I am scratching my head about is if we are seeing the light from 1k+ light years ago, isn't it possible that these huge dips could just be something passing in front of our view of that light?  Maybe not even anywhere near the star itself.  Perhaps a few hundred light years closer to us? Like a photobomb.... any thoughts?"
???????????? and huge multiple planets close by werent even discussed ? :(
"Maybe it is an alien civilization trying to use the star to send a message to the whole universe.  Since they don't know in which direction others will be detecting the light blocking signals, they must have designed the structures in such a way that it sends the same pattern of signals in all directions possibly at different times."
"And what if it's a black hole that the star is orbiting? As the star goes behind it, it's image would be massively distorted slowly over time, and it would last a while too. And then as the star begins to get absorbed by the black hole, weird crap starts going down."
"LOL, Kepler is observing alien space battle? Yea people provide funding to this..."
"Before I wathc, is this real astronomy or just feminist astronomy?"

It was a bird flying past her telescope
What a load of crap.
"I'm going for the aliens idea. The natural ones just seem so far fetched that they're completely improbable. I mean we don't even know where comets come from, what's the chance of there being tens of thousands of them flying by at once, or some crazy asteroids. 

My bet is that it's the remnants of a fusion sphere. Or it's directing its energy away from us somehow. Crazy tho either way"
What about 1 or multiple dead stars (of similar or lesser mass) caught in a chaotic orbital gravity battle with the living star/sun that is producing the light that is being seen?
"We still don't know everything about our universe. Given that the universe is infinite and given that the Big Bang existed, we still don't know anything about our universe.  We're just using past information and patterns to solve problems.  We don't even know all of the species that live on OUR planet!  BTW--most of our satellites are looking down on earth rather than in the heavens"
Dyson spheres sound like the incredibly inefficient short sighted idea of mid 20th century thinkers.  Why would they need to be that big just to harvest energy? A species would have probably harnessed zero point vacuum energy long before they even left their home planet
What if the planet blew up?
What if something is happening inside the star core that is making this drop of energy ?
what the flux?
"I don't believe in any Dison spheres. If you will cover the sun with the hand at 100 meters from you, you will see 99,9% of the sun light, but if you will put your hand right in front of your eyes you won't see any light. This is what I do believe in. There is something closer to the telescope. And this something is a cloud of dust or a bunch of objects spinning around each other."
she didnt mention rings on planets like saturn but litle biger?
Finally! A useful TED talk!
This is so cool
"I think its just a planet falling into the star, that got crushed by gravity and made a dust cloud"

"Sorry to the speaker, but this was one of the worst TED talks I've watched. Content was pretty weak, and prese tation was worse."
I think it could be multiple planets passing at once.Maybe even planets and moons
maybe a black dwarf
Extinguished orbiting brown dwarf binary star with its own set of orbiting planets? Causing irregular and large transit light drop?
it is not serious..
Awesome !
Massive planets with massive moons orbiting them? Rings of more dense matter?  A massive moon inside the rings?  Planets with multiple moons?
Today's scientists: cool to find aliens; WTF; excited about zero conclusions.
Keemstar built that
Why didn´t anyone think about one or more black holes passing in front of the star?
female scientists... what a joke.
maybe the star is actually dimming on its own or maybe its dragging an astroid belt with it
Or it could be within its own system which could very well be a planetary alignment?
A Dyson Sphere however would take more resources than could be found on one planet!
"Looks to me like we're looking at a huge young debris cloud that disperses over the years, hence the increasingly asynchronous dips. It also seems to have a defined edge on one side and a somewhat ""fuzzy"" one on the other. 
A swarm of comets would kind of fit that picture."
It's not aliens. What are the chances that we find a k 2 civilization just as its starting up. Only in one star? Why only one star? Why not hundreds or millions of stars?
How about our Suns binary twin that pushed through the Kepler belt sending thousands of asteroids ahead and behind it blocking the light?
Please put this on one of  the operational activity list when James Webb Telescope becomes operational.
"the shittiest star in the universe....







Donald trump"
"Really?
Isn't it obvious?
First dip is a Jupiter class planet with a Super-Earth sized moon.
Second dip is the same, but the moon is in a different part of it's orbit.
Third dip, multiple planets, in close alignment.

Heck, the whole thing can be a series of alignment events, especially if there's any resonance to the orbits."
Its swamp gas
"Even if it is something like a Dysons sphere, why would they make it asymmetric?"
"This woman though intelligent lack the basic etiquette of public speaking i.e. looking towards your audience,and that is pretty annoying."
Would multiple planets at varied distances and basically in one extremely long line explain this?
"I really don't support the idea of any possible ""ET"", but it's still sorta interesting..."
"Some people say it's build around the sun, but the story started the structure orbit AROUND the sun like planets do. So what is the truth?
Maybe it's a fable story, which i hope it isn't. But if it's real, then i think it's something in orbit around the sun very variable. If it was build directly around the sun, then the curvatures would be permanently because it would be build directly around the sun. It have to be something NOT directly around the sun, because they have seen very long periods of calmth and no lightcurves. IF this story is real, we need to discover what it is indeed.

Maybe there is something more closer then it looks like, because they talk about the megastructure. How would they build something like that big? Maybe it is a smaller structure closer to earth then we know. It's moving anyway but we don't know where it's moving exactly. The curves come with periods, the curvatures are not permanently present.

Or maybe it is a planet with many rings in all directions, wobbling around that area without 1 correct orbit? Maybe we discover a new kind of planet were many rings around the planet are strong enough to disturb its correct orbit?

Im not an educated person in astronomy, but im very excited and interested in all this."
Why couldn't it be that something passed between the star and us much closer to us than something in the star's orbit?
"Maybe the sun orbits a black hole in a slight angle, so it doesnt pass directly in front of the sun from our point of view. The gravity of the black hole maybe be resposible for the hyperbolic decline in sunlight. Also a slight imperfection in the orbit or ours, maybe account for the big changes in sunlight drop. More data will probably lead us to the correct data. Just an idea for a non-professional."
This belongs on TedX
could it be clouds of dark matter passed by and deflected the light with gravitational lens ?
"Has anyone ruled out that this could be a galactic version of a  Naval ""signal lamp""?"
"OK, I've been following this since the story got out, and I have had plenty of time to think about it. I watched this video about two months ago now. Here I will focus on one statement she made: When something absorbs large amounts of energy for whatever purpose, ""it cannot defy the laws of physics!"" So if this is a mega structure, we should be seeing waste heat energy.

Well I would have to disagree! Here's why:
1. Such a civilization that has the ability to build such a structure would by definition be far more advanced than we currently are. Yes she did say this, and I am in agreement with that part of what she said.
2. If this is an advanced civilization able to build a Dyson Sphere or Swarm, as the case may be, then it is not inconceivable to think that they may have developed the ability to capture the waste heat from their operations and channel it back into a consumable form. This would of course possibly be able to make use of 100% of all collected energy from the star; either in its original form, or in converted forms. Of course it may not be 100% efficient, but such an advanced civilization could still use almost all of it, at least 99.9% or more, so that any waste heat that escapes would not be detectable from our viewpoint.

Right here on Earth we are seeing the beginnings of such technology already. There are new automobiles that can recycle some of the energy they get from the driving energy to run on-board systems. Really this is a step in the right direction for technology on our planet, given the cost of energy in whatever form we choose to use. So if we already have something that is moving us in this direction, why would we assume that a more advanced civilization had not developed such technology and advanced it to the level of almost no waste energy being lost?

I'm not saying this is actually what is happening with this star, but it is far more likely than the comet swarm hypothesis. What I am saying is do not count the alien civilization scenario out just yet. As our observation technology continues to advance, we will be able to resolve more and more of what is out there hundreds and thousands of light-years from us. Soon we will likely be able to look at this star with an instrument that can show enough detail to actually determine what it is that is causing these extreme light curve dips. Then we can put the mystery to rest."
It's a shame to get funding. She fears want the other observatories will find.
"Jesus made it clear that He was from another ""Kosmos"" which means planetary system. Jesus ascended in a ""cloud"" which is a starship. Jesus will come back ""with"" the ""clouds"". Jesus will return commanding a fleet of starships. The Bible is the most UFO book ever. It shows ""clouds"" going up and down with people going in and out. The day scientists understand that the Bible is a real encounter with aliens and the ancient people on the earth will be easier to understand lots of things. Sorry to inform you but we don't own this planet. Jesus made it clear that He is coming back to take control. Read the Bible with a UFO point of view and you will understand everything."
AAAAALIEEEEENSS!!!
Black hole maybe?
Nicely presented. my bet is also on the natural phenomena....
"What if it's a departing alien fleet, heading our way to get our franklins?"
"I guessed some of the things she said, I feel clever hahahah"
could it possibly be a small piece of space dust that is close to the telescope rather than a large object close to the star?
"A fading star should loose it's universe to the next strongest energy available , another star. Is that what's happening ? Visit YOUTUBE SUNLIGHT ELECTRO RAY'S visibly showing planetary orbit's powered by sunlight energy not gravity. lol"
"I find it unlikely that aliens would build mega structures. After all what are we doing? we are constantly trying to become more energy efficient, so why not shrink down and become small. That would also be very safe, the smaller a civilization could be the more efficient. We would not emit any signals that would be significant either. Image if earth with all it's humans was a big as an keyboard button floating around in space - who would discover us then?! Sounds very safe. Perhaps this is a more likely route once a civilization become advanced enough. Maybe that is why it is so hard to find someone out there if all advanced civilizations are too small to notice."
What if KIC 8462852 is a donut shaped star?
would it be possible that the comets are at a distance far enough away to not get drawn into the stars gravitational pull and instead of getting drawn in the comets just continue to rotate around the star such as the rotation of earth and other planets in our solar system rotation around our star. which would cause the continuation of the stars dimming as they are
What are the odds that what we are seeing is a fleet of ships leaving Tabby's star and heading our direction.  As they get further and further away from the star the fleet of ships covers more and more of the star.
Why are humans so fucking retarded its obvious its an alien structure why is it so hard for people to understand we arent the only life out there just our OBSERVABLE universe is 93 BILLION light years

The most mysterious choice of attire in the universe | Tabetha Boyajian
"Our technological civilization is at best 200 years old. Imagine one 200 million years old. Or older than that. Anything is possible. One more thing; Using techniques beyond our grasp a super advanced alien civilization most certainly would know about earth and have for a long time. We would stand out big time.  Not because of radio signals, but because  of the very special nature  of our blue planets ecology. Which itself goes back hundreds of millions of years."
"Okay, here is a thought.  What if a large massive planet in a very highly elliptical orbit were passing in front of the star and that orbit also Crossed the orbits of other planets.This would account for the asymmetrical dip and I believe the time frames involved.  Or perhaps even a planet with a shifting elliptical orbit But in both cases the minor axis runs perpendicular with Our line of observation."
Wow. It blocks the star almost 20 percent?? Thats so Huge enough.
Interesting topic. Astronomy is my most favorite.
Junk science.  More adults needed.  Just go play your video games please.
dyson sphere
"I think it is much greater then we can imagine, we haven't even discovered all of our own earth, so what is waiting for us in the universe?!"
"it might be planet that have moons, binary planets."
please please let it be alien civilization.
"This is absolutely fascinating! I had read a bit about it, but the way she breaks it down. As soon as i saw that 15% dip in light my jaw hit the ground!"
"The ""structure"" around Tabby's Star, if its such, might must be a Radiation shield, not a dyson's sphere as often proposed."
To make a sphere that big you would need to dismantle probably all the planets in our solar system...not so practical
"you know the kardashev scale... according to it we're a 0.7 type civilization, once 1.0 would be a civilization able to consume the whole energy of a planet, and it do has an example of what could be the mistery behind the star kic, a type 2.0 civilization which is able to consume the whole energy of a star of course it's just a theory (one i don't believe) but has some logic anyway your theory was very good your video too keep it up thank you."
Pattern recognition should start with neuroscience..
couldn't it be like just space debris passing very close in front of the instrument?
so did seti start listening?
"How about there is an asteroid swarm not bound to the orbit of a single solar system, but somewhere in the interstellar space between us and that star. When the objects are way closer to us than the star itself they would block out way more light, wouldn't they? Please correct me if i'm wrong but that seems way more likly to me than aliens, even though i want it to be aliens aswell ^^"
"How about a few planets orbits coinciding occasionally ?  Our solar systems planets have different orbital periods that every now and the coincide, just a thought ."
"The Germans observed another star like this. They say its a protoplanetary disk that’s oriented 'edge-on' in relation to Earth. Sorry, no aliens."
I suspect a orc cloud disturbance clumping up in the line of sight It would be the logical answer of the duration and the spikes and valleys in the signal
I personally welcome our new overlords.
why not in German ???
Maybe some one is mining the star.
Why is this star named after her? She seems to have little to do with finding it.
the mere fact alone that this phenomenon is occurring on a regular interval tells me it's natural
Tabetha Boyajian says the reptilians that inhabit our planet come from star 8462852 *confirmed*
Noooo Dyson sphere again....
Well I guess the aliens would have already discovered us if they had a technology so advanced ...
Yeah; yeah; but its Aliens.
"Maybe they are missing the point with dyson spheres. Could it be that extraterrestrials are using something else to cover their energy needs. Maybe it could something along the line of an aritificial ""gravitational singularity"" (wormwhole).  A dyson sphere might be the analogous equivalent of 16th century wind and sail technology to propel ships in concept."
So I'm assuming we can't see the dimming it's just data?
"One thing Tabetha neglected to hypothesise in relation to the increased dimming both in intensity and duration. Anyone work it out? If the celestial body was moving closer to Earth, it would increase the intensity and duration of the dimming as it was monitored from our planet or any probe that was in it's line of sight. The only way to prove or disprove is to monitor and determine that the increase of light absorption and duration is increasing exponentially. Is that happening?"
Why do I think Tabby is hot?!  😘
"Could it be solar sail launches? Irregular aperiodic space launches in different directions? Imagine a solar sail hundreds or thousands of miles across being unfurled close to the star. Wouldn't it blot out a lot of the light, but for a very short time?"
que grosooooooo!!!!!!
"i think its a pretty drastic and risky assumption to state that the object is an alien megastructure, even worse for a scientist to say it"
Why can't I add a translation while there seem to be many?
Yo mama so fat when she farts she causes a big drop in the schemes of NASA.
Most likely something massive was torn apart on the orbit. Or something passed by (OMG!!! Allianz!!!) and shake the star's world. WTH? Why supernatural hypothesis?
comedy women)))She's beautiful))
thats where sammy gravano is
13min of money bagging.
"I think we could analyze this mystery from another approach, for example not thinking stops emitting light for transit of an opaque body , but by the light Increased front of the transit of companion stars .
If the base is the light of the star, because not turn the matter thinking that the base can be the star more companions , and decreased light is when companions are hidden ?"
Could a number of overlapping thus superimposing planets orbitting the star explain the assymetry? We ve assumed so far that only one planet is passing at a time.
I think if those are alien made i think its a bad idea trying to contact them if the sphere thingy is real and harvesting their parent star energy if they found out that a not so technologically humanoid race contacting them from a planet with abundant resource it would be a huge mistake take us for example colonizing killing the local inhabitants from our early history of colonizing a continent or enslaving them and if they are truly an intelligent race why wouldnt you expect the same thing
Necrons
Aliens! 100%!!!!!!!!
Actually Ms. Boyjian last resort explanation would be not the far fetched... fist blob was the scout second blob attack fleet third blob cleanup crew :D The shapes nearly look like a star destroyer... asymetric and the tails is short :P
"What if instead of being a megastructure, it is just a huge planet that still belongs to our solar system? Or it could be a huge amount of material that belongs to the cloud of Oort?"
OMG these people are so smart!!
"Dr. Boyajian, I just had a thought. Rare for me, but sometimes it happens. Regarding KIC 8462852 (Tabby's Star) have scientists at NASA or Astronomers there ever considered the Kepler observations might be the result of a double planet (Two large worlds orbiting each other)? Or even a Roche world? This would account for the variability in the Kepler readings as the planets revolved around one another."
"It could be a rouge asteroid in space that's a lot closer to us than that star, or a rogue planet with moons."
Anything capable of annihilating an entire planet would have had to deliver an extraordinary amount of energy not only to fragment the rock of an entire planet and accelerate it sufficiently to overcome the gravitational forces between the fragments should have produced a similarly vast quantity of waste heat. Such an uneven distribution of orbits seems like it shouldn't be gravitationally stable enough for them to have cooled sufficiently to leave no evidence in the infrared yet not have started clumping together into numerous larger moon sized bodies by now.
Maybe a dwarf with its own planet / objects in tow.?

great
What if a yooge planet smashed into the star? Would its contents and debris cause the star to dim for a period of time sporadically? Say a hundred days?
could be bunch of planets with various orbits and speeds and the the large light dip could be when they align with our direction.
Why wouldn't a planet of any size be able to block out most or all of a star's light when passing between it and us? We have solar eclipses here on Earth which is basically the same thing... doesn't the planet's distance from its host star make a huge difference in the amount of light it can block?
why are we taking keplar off this?? it should take precident over any other  mission . color me disgusted
I think we may have just found intelligent life
What about a similar phenomenon comparable to the Keiper belt?
answer: A BIGASS ASTEROID!
"Ahhhh the human race...... spending billions on looking for ET whilst we blow each other up and watch as people eat rats and live in their own filth. Tabetha might be excited but I'm not. If an advanced civilization came here just now, frankly, I'd be embarrassed for our race."
Nice marketing strategy to capture funding.
It's the dark matter.
"Could be a solar system with lots of planets on different orbits, some maybe passing at the same time to cause the weird data."
I would have guess 'rogue black hole'. Explaining such void of light during the orbit. But that would mean the black hole would be orbiting the star.  Which would be a no-go....fail.
"Apparently, they've been able to rule out every explanation except one: alien intelligence. Seriously. There is NO WAY NASA or anyone else would be giving lectures like this until all other possibilities could be ruled out. Now, they are going public. It's very spooky,"
That final line. Amazing.
what if a black hole interfere with our path of vision to the star
I think they are seeing multiple planet all passing through at once but in different positions
"My second guess would be involve intelligent life, but, instead of harvesting energy from their star, they're actually dimming their star on purpose in such a way that it would appear unnatural to another civilization advanced enough to detect it! Perhaps they've already deduced the regions of space most likely to harbor life. Perhaps they've already detected unnatural activities on this planet from theirs. In which case, they're using their star to transmit ""smoke signals"", if you will. If their solar system have an asteroid belt/field (similar to ours) that they've colonized to the point where they can simply move asteroids around in large groups in an attempt to communicate their presence..."
"I have two guesses. First, I'd bet on a stellar anomaly. Perhaps this dip in starlight weren't transits of object at all! Maybe the star is not only unstable in its rotation, but also has VERY large sunspots that are irregular in shape? That might explain the dip in light without the evidence of something nearby being heated??"
maybe money is talking? just speculating..
"wouldn't covering your star with a dyson sphere kill all life on your planet? 

Also what if you spend trillions building a Dyson sphere and a comet hit it,  that would be a huuuge waste of resources."
Could it be just like sunspots? Dark patches on the star?
"This video was interesting until 9:20. Then, it became science fiction."

Does Jesus exist at all
Humans are't ready not to be the smartest most advanced in the galaxy yet so they keep looking for aliens in the most convoluted and uncertain ways whilst their own planet is crawling with evidence for the existence of advanced aliens.
Very interesting. The speaker presented this well & I give props the the last question asked to the audience.
Surely the star is surrounded by multiple satellites which have varying orbits and are of varying sizes. Although the laws of physics may place restrictions on the combinations of these they doubtless allow a fair number of combinations. At certain points in the orbits of the multiple satellites more light will be blocked than others; if several satellites happen to line up in a string as opposed to directly in front of one another for instance. The pattern will vary based on which satellites of which sizes were in front of the star at the time of observation. By observing the star over a long period of time one might be able to theories the number of satellites and their sizes. As to whether any of the satellites of the star harbour life is purely speculation.
"the sphere thingy she is talking about, is so huge to a point I cant conceive even advanced alliens constructing it, I mean where would the material (matter) solid, come from ?? all the planets matter in a solar system combined won't be enough ..."
DYSON SPHERE!!!!!
"so i was thinking, whats the end goal of intelligent life would be?  to populate the universe until what, there was no room? and then what. evovle to a point where you realize the only thing worth doing is destorying the universe? or reverse the big bang?  i mean what would be the challenge of an civilization thats got all the resources it needs, it wouldnt be simply filling up space would it?  i mean , theres gotta be something more challenging than just filling up a hard drive with 1's and 0's , is it just to have fun until it all ends? is there a goal? are we the last hope of some bigger plan that's counting on us to do something with this universe,  fix it, heal it, or just enjoy it? i dunno"
"Bah, hogwash and crazy talk. Can't wait for Trump to further defund those day dreamers at NASA. The military surely will be able to put that money to much better use, right?"
Is not so hard to understand. *IS THE ZERG SWARM* and it is coming. Hail to the blade queen
Chuck Norris walked past a few times. That's all.
how do they measure Jupiter's transit? when did it get between the earth and the sun?
"Can someone explain to me why this reasoning would be incorrect? That the meteor cluster lead is plausible (as the data does follow closest) but that the comets are just farther away from the planet, as in flying by closer to the device measuring light leaks? Is it possible that comets within the vicinity of the satellite could be the cause of light being lost?"
"Why is thousands, to tens of thusands, of comets so obsurd in this vast diversity of ""dust"" like masses, that are uncountable?
Thoes are such small numbers."
she's Armenian :) or at least has an Armenian name
"How about asteroid debris belt in our line of sight, but just much closer to observable object so interruptions in light it seems larger? Also explains radomness of these obruptions."
"I'm still a little confused about transit photometry. How does this method determine the size? Wouldn't we need to know both the distance to the star and the distance of the object transiting in front of the star in order to determine the objects size? It seems to me that by just measuring brightness, you could have an asteroid pass relatively closely in front of the sensors that would block out an enormous amount of light. I could be wrong here. My other thought is that the light diffracting around the object solves this problem, but I'd like to know what the right answer is. I don't know much about astronomy (and its been a while since college physics), but like most people I'm very curious about space."
The planet(s) were ingested slowly.  The light mass would be sucked into the star leaving the larger pieces to orbit till they became pulled into the star again!

It was Galactus trying to eat the planet
There was a tiny speck of dust on the camera. :-)
How do they know the size? A bigger object could block the same amount of light if proportionally closer to the star. Just asking.
"And 20 years later, the scientists are astonished to find that the F star suddenly goes supernova...

Stupid Aliens, should have never broadcast your location to the universe"
there must be a natural explanation. I don't buy the little green men building a dyson sphere at all. even more nowadays when people get fame and fortune by selling snake oil theories.
"As much as I would love to believe it's Aliens, I suspect as other scientist review the data, and collect new data, some kind of astronomical event will explain it. It's important to keep a open, but skeptical mind."
"What if there is planet with many moons, or smaller planets?"
"Comets? The woman said a massive object 1000 times the area of Earth is blocking out the light from this star. Either it's a REALLY big comet, or tens of thousands of comets flying by at that exact time, both of which I find hard to believe."
"Could be a planet getting to close to the star. And maybe, getting chewed up in the process. Wouldn`t mind a closer look."
"Encore sun spots, take a bow."
"But if the thing passing between the earth and that star is closer to earth, that should give a bigger hit on the graph. I would guess something is going towards or from earth in a diagonal fashion not that far from earth compared to the star. Together with the rotation of earth maybe that could contribute to an explanation. Surely it must sound like one of the more reasonable compared to gigantic alien solarpanels."
id put  my money on a giant ring system
"It's a shame that money is slowing down this whole exploration. Mankind is of much more capable! The only thing they can bring up is: Who should pay for it? I tell you what: We have the resources, we have the knowledge, we have all we need, but stupid capitalism reinforces peoples egoism!"
Great Presentation! Bravo!
"I say we need more data. If we consistently keep on observing this pattern for this star and/or other stars, we can make better predictions.
But I like the idea of aliens. :P"
i just think they are biased by what we know about the space in our close vicinity and the immense hope of discovering aliens
"I think it could be dark spots like on our sun, but to a larger degree."
"Did the ""WOW"" signal come from that direction?
It's possible that instead of it being a Dyson Sphere they realized that some species would look for life elsewhere through the means we use to check for planets. It's a pretty good way to say, ""we're here, and we want you to know that""."

"she explained it exactly like data did, including WHY they'd have to build it. they got the science that accurate."
it's Russell's teapot
"When you hear hoof beats, think horses not zebras."
"No this is probably not aliens but I'm going to say aliens aliens aliens over and over again so you still have that idea in your head that it's not aliens yet it's giving you the idea of that it could possibly be aliens, wink wink. 
I'll be modest and say it's not aliens just a natural explanation to this data, however I wouldn't mind it to be aliens because that's what we are making you believe by all this aliens and alien megastructures talk, what an actress she should get a oscar."
WOW
"Sounds like an ordinary if large spaceship maneuvering in orbit as substructures dock & um-dock with it. Remembering the human space civilization in only 4 decades old and has ISS that's about twice the size of a house in orbit, most space civilizations should have large structures."
"It COULD BE ""The Comet Planet"" (Hercolubus) passing by with its MASSIVE tail.  We are seeing MANY meteors coming in now, are we not?"
"Wouldn't it make sense to pay attention also to neighbouring stars of KIC 8462852? In the case this unlikely alien hypothesis is correct, and they are indeed the cause of such a weird dip in the star's luminosity, so are very advanced, wouldn't they have had the opportunity to visit other stars nearby, and maybe mess around with their luminosity too?"
blind leading the blind
"In 2009, it only dipped 11%. In 2011, it dipped 15%. Then in 2013, it dipped 20%. But in 2013, it split into three little ones. To me, this solar system has either a small sun with three gigantic planets. 2009 was the smaller planet that orbit around the sun. 2011 shows the second planet that orbit around the sun. And 2013, all three planets orbiting around the sun in an elliptical patterns."
Could it not just be different planets very slowly rotating around the star. The difference in % means it might not be the same object every time?

"The planets around the star are aligning and this would account for the varying duration and mass that they are recording. I find it hard to believe that this has not been considered to be the only logical explanation. Solar panels? really? Our planets align all the time and if our sun was being observed from across the universe, I would hope that their astronomers would be intelligent enough to realize this. FEB 05, 2016 was the first time we could see all five bright planets – Mercury, Venus, Saturn, Mars, Jupiter – at once since 2005. They were up before dawn. Remember, when you looked at them, you were looking edgewise into the plane of our solar system."
The most likely explanation is an unstable star with variant output.
"Great, if we find aliens and they look into our history of extra terrestrial movies, they would see that 90% of the time, we kill them."
"If we had really encountered some data from an alien civilization , we are on the path to finding them And i can only hope that they will become our allies ......"
I wanna smoke some alien bud...
Aliens live in cyberspace and dont need much energy
"Is there a particular reason why they don't seem to be suspecting the star itself?  They did consider whether it was young and surrounded by a cloud left over from formation, but aren't there a lot of possibilities like the star having recently ingested something large (planet scale or larger), and still roiling and irregular due to that?  I'm no astrophysicist, and don't know if perhaps something like what I suggested might have a characteristic signature that is missing, but given the almost total lack of consideration of irregularities in the stars output itself (rather than output being blocked) makes me think that maybe there is some evidence that establishes fairly clearly that the star is regular enough that it couldn't be any oddity with the star, but must be something between it and our detector."
"Can’t it just be space rocks IN BETWEEN Kepler telescope and the star, blocking its light? I mean depending on their trajectory, it could block light for weeks… And it could appear bigger if you assume the object is closer from the star than it actually is."
Maybe they are BIG aliens with BIG ships.
Obviously a star destroyer.
"If I were a member of a sufficiently advanced ExtraTerrestrial race that, like us, was in the process of searching the cosmos for evidence of other species and I wanted to send a signal to make other species aware of our existence then I would definitely use starlight fluctuations to do so. This is assuming that said race hasn't already come up with a viable means of interplanetary/ interstellar travel."
I have read 4200 ufo books and I proposed on April 6th it was an alien fleet. A Dyson sphere would be to hard to defend.
"peeps, dang thousand love   this look mlghtiuy play"
It's Jesus
"""alien hypotheses should always be a last resort""? what an unreasonable and unscientific limitation on knowledge.

there is no scientific basis for that aphorism, other than to protect the current paradigms."
Cool.
it's a death star
Has anyone ever considered that the star may have just been eclipsed by space debris from our own solar system? This seems to be the most logical and plausible explanation to me...
"seems like there is a few satellites (moons) around a certain planet that sometimes they are to the side and sometimes front or behind that change the readings depending on the time. Or maybe a few planets in sync sometimes and sometimes not so much, so the readings change from time to time. It's not aliens! There are plenty of intelligent probabilities that we could hypothesize."
"""What do you mean a bunch of teenagers blew up the deathstar?"""
"It could be one big egg that.... !
.... !   That opened into many tiny chicken like planets."
Wow what a story
I heard they already resolved this. In early 2016 it was discovered that a concept known as 'fuel scooping' was causing the star to dim. I don't know much more about it though.....
It could be the smoking gun for the birkeland current star formation model. i.e stars are primarily electrical phenomena and are not as stable as the nuclear fusion model supposes.
i don't think it would be awesome to find an alien race capable of making Dyson sphere level structures any more than it's awesome for ants to find your house
it is good we are researching aliens but we should not be inviting them either!
That a citizen observer would fine something. I should have listened to my mother and played the lottery.
What are the chances of that?
Maybe its asteroid belts causing the varied drops. Chunks as big as earth.
Could it be some fairly small dust/ice/rocks that went by the telescope very close
could it be that this planet has a very large numbers of rings like Saturn. .that would block out the star light unevenly and also account for its seemingly large size
"Yeah, my bad on the dips... I was flying my quadrotor around that altitude that day. Arduino4Life"
"We ARE ourselves the aliens we are so keen to find and to meet.... The sky is the mirror, which provides the view on endless reflection of ourselves repeated over billions of years billions of times. Anything you see on the night sky is either The Sun in distant past, or the same Sun in the future... Dyson Sphere discussed in the topic is something we will be building ourselves eventually. What we see today is the reflection of that."
"Please let it be  the Ferengi's :D

Wonder why it is more reasonable to believe in alien life than God. Just thinking
The data were good!
Don't call the aliens ... I've seen independence day ... i know how this would go down.
"She didn't explain the reason why it is getting bigger and bigger despite of all her crazy theories. Well, if someone asked me I'd put my money on this: the object they're observing is approaching us and distancing the source they're observing. It'd be the same thing of pointing a flash light at the wall and passing your hand right in front of the it. As your hand gets farther from the source of light, your shadow gets bigger. In this case, as the object (whatever it is) gets farther from the star and closer to us its shadow become bigger to us and takes more time to go round the star. But this is just my opinion and I'm a civil engineer, not an astronomer :)"
The light was blocked by a binary blob consisting of Chris Christie and Rush Limbaugh passing in front of the star.
"The arbitrary and vacuously true explanations as of yet are only exercises (useless) in creativity until the data is further refined.  

The description that the star 'dims' is vague.  Drill down, and think about this - Dims?  In the sense that the +entire+ star dims (free of obstruction) like a dimmable light bulb?  Or, 2) That the +overall+ light that comes from the star is simply less, and potentially affected by obstructing bodies (like planets, debris, etc.)?  

Now, if it were possible to catch light from many different areas of that star we may be better able to determine that.  That would then help to confirm or rule out presence of large obstructions whether they are orbiting planets, large bodies of gas, UFOs, pink unicorns or dyson sphere components.  

Making up arbitrary explanations is fun yet counterproductive to the non-arbitrary data that we have been collecting.  Focus on this data, we will then get the answer."
It could possibly be a very dense asteroid field tumbling around
What about planets orbiting in a line? One after the other.
Could it be just an asteroid belt's elliptical shape wobbling in and out of our line of sight from it's star?  She doesn't mention anything about that.
"Great way to start the thing with an overused logical fallacy.  ""Extraordinary
claims require extraordinary evidence"" is itself an extraordinary claim lol"
Most probable explanation.  Super Jovian with planet-sized moons.
"I""M NOT SAYING IT""S ALIENS.... YES I AM, IT""S ALIENS. DEFINITELY ALIENS"
I don't think a Dyson Sphere makes any sense whatsoever.  The resources required would exceed the material of thousands of solar systems.  The time and energy to build would require billions of years. If your technology permitted all this why not just pick up and move to another star.   Are so obsessed with aliens you actually spend time coming up with this drivel.  Its like a new religion.
This is like drama for nerds.
"I wish they went into something more substantial instead of engrossing.  I like the last idea but what about an explanation of a very large planet exploding from  gravitational pressure which we already see from several moons in our own solar system.  It's not as exciting, but then...yeah, moons and planets exploding from overwhelming force is."
I am wondering if it could be a growing sunspot(s).  Could it be signs of the sun dying? Or something falling into the sun?
omg../... we barely know the closest planets..don't know science but it's waaay too much for our knowledge(even if she speaks in theory)
smart Armenian woman! :)
"If it is an alien structure, future observations should be able to pick up a repeating pattern in the transit light dips. Wouldn't this kind of structure limit the amount of energy reaching their planet?"
"""The data were good""... perhaps she should learn English."
"What if it was just something at a really vast distance from the star (slightly closer to us)... which was not orbiting the star? It would block more of the light for a longer period of time... right? 

So all you need is a ""rogue object"" (whatever that would be -natural/sentient being made) of significant size, at a significant distance from the star moving around at random intervals, relative to the star."
how about GIANT SOLAR SPOTS ???
If I lived in a sufficiently advanced society wishing to send a message across the galaxy I would use my local star to send a message.  We can see the light from stars thousands of light years away. I would use a flotilla of satellites stretching Mylar like sheets broad enough to block star light alternately.

"Personally, I think they have missed something with their models of stars. It is being shown that stars have a strong electrical nature, and can Z-pinch electrical currents to form x-ray emissions at random intervals (according to the density of the electric currents at any given time). This is not standard cosmology, but it could explain the more random, surprising events, like this one."
It's my ex.
light passes by a singularity or two when its orbit is observed from Earth.

or maybe thats how alien communicates, by blinking their star... instead of using radio wave/ SETI"
"I have a doubt
if a star is massive and and planet a little larger than the size of Jupiter orbits it at a very large orbit?
then it might block 15% the light from it's parent star right?"
"it probably a bicycle a big one ,they tend to get left every where"
"If they have the technology to build a Dyson sphere, isn't possible that their solar efficiency had already reached close to 100%? That would explain the lack of infrared radiation.

Think about the economics here. Why would one build a Dyson sphere if solar efficiency could be increased and was being increased such as here on Earth? It would be better to spend those resources building a better a solar panel instead of building a giant megastructure. A Dyson sphere would be the final product if energy could not be captured in a more efficient form. 

That said my money is also on the natural phenomenon. For our own sake of future technology that may be a good thing. Why would anyone build a Dyson sphere if cold fusion is possible? If this possible advanced alien civilization id building Dyson spheres, does that mean cold fusion was never possible? Or safe nuclear reactors?"
dyson sphere
ummm...so there's no other objects that are between the us and that star.
How did the computer missed these huge peaks that we need human to spot them.
A civilization that is capable of building something like this would have probably found a way for this structure to absorb 100% of the energy coming at it. This would explain why it doesn't emit heat.

And that the moons may be on an irregular orbit.  Just because you see a regular dip in the light coming from one sun, doesn't mean that there is a planet associated with that sun orbiting it.  How much are these knuckleheads being paid to come up with this rubbish?"

those fluctuation also can be a big moon or moons
what if it's a bunch of planets which when transit the star at the same time there is a huge dip in graph and when they transit partially yen there is ups and downs in graph ?? This could also explain that graph right?
Shadow in the Warp... Tyranids are coming
"Hardly any black people in the audience, smart people are just so racist."
I think it is a space gnat getting in between Kepler and the star.
give me what she is smoking
"it would be some dancing planet, like miley cyrus as she always lay down while performing."
"What if they have a heat sink absorbing emissions, in order to remain stealth? Not from us but from their enemies. The heat could be recycled as energy or if they're not ones for recycling... later ejected onto an unsuspecting gas giant.  

Those technologies may seem laughable to us here and now but it's much in the same way you'd be laughed out of the building in 1016, if you claimed people would fly around in giant metal tubes and climb the heavens, in the future. They'd probably have burned you. At least now it's just a patronizing chuckle.  :-P 

I'm not someone who thinks aliens are visiting and haunt the Apollo missions or any of that craziness, but they're definitely way out there. Most likely totally unaware of us. 

If you think in 21st century terms and limitations, yeah it's all impossible. But there's always a way around everything eventually. 

My view may seem idealistic to some, but it gives us a whole lot more credit as a galactic species. The laws of physics are dictated by whatever our current understanding of it is.  This is a thing that has not remained static since inception, so if one is to acknowledge trends.. as a scientist does... looking at history... one must project outrageous accomplishments in the distant future."
"I wonder about all the star systems where the planets orbit in a polar orbit. Something  where there wouldn't be any observable transits in front of that star, from where we are, relative to it."
"well, that was chuck norris...."
"One cannot measure distances of greater than about 25 light-years using parallax since we don't know EXACTLY where (not only does the Earth go around the sun, the sun orbits the galactic center, etc. so determining exactly where Earth was 180 days ago is all the more difficult) the Earth was sixth months ago using the Earth's ORBIT around the sun as the base of the triangle. Just ONE light-year has an angle of ONLY 0.017 degrees already! If u think Red Shift measures/accurately gauges distances 2 distant objects, u need 2 know that red shift is QUANTIZED (only at certain energy levels), absolutely ruling out the Dopper Effect explanation, may b caused by tired light, (Light may lose energy naturally as it travels and remember that since light has mass, it is affected by other objects with mass. A solar sail works because light has momentum and therefore mass. If you believe light has energy, and energy is mass according to Einstein, then you believe light has mass.) objects moving @ right angles to us, & when gravity is acting on an object. There's this object moving TOWARDS us that is still red-shifted!!! There's this pair of objects connected with radically different redshifts that proves the big bang wrong. In addition, in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, near the center, where the velocities are extremely high, the red-shift is somehow washed out. This strongly implies that strong motion DESTROYS the redshift, instead of creating it. A galaxy has even been measured to have a DECREASE of one quantization in redshift, which should be impossible if the universe is expanding and the redshift is due to the doppler effect. YouTube: Stretching the Heavens: A New Cosmology. Google Science vs Evolution Pathlights. We can barely make out PLUTO with our best telescopes and yet we are told astronomers have detected a planet 1,300 or so light-years away?! Think about it. The object MAY be thousands of light-years away but we cannot measure those distances. We are simply TOO TINY, to put it humbly. And yes, there may be no such thing as deep space. Perhaps the ""far away"" objects are just super-tiny. It's possible. How could we know the difference? The Cosmic Background Radiation is much too cold to have come from the supposed Big Bang. It actually comes from stars. The heavens shall pass away with a great noise... interesting how from a biblical perspective, the big bang is in the future, where the heavens will be passed AWAY, instead of in the past, where it supposedly created the universe."
that if its just a aligned planets!!!!!!
It's got me fluxed!
If the star itself was varying you would expect changes in the spectrum; if only the intensity alters then this must be the result of obstruction.
"what's funny about this is that, whatever we are seeing coming from this star, it happened billions of years ago :)"
"Is there a possibillity for unknown big dark objects circling our own system to appear as light fluctuations when passing infront of an observed star, such as the one in question?"
"It seems like that star somehow itselve is fluctuating i know if stars would fluctuat they would just fall out of buisiness, but it might be some place were the laws of phisics are not... well working like they are here"
"The question is, if we can see them, can they see us?"
"So perhaps it is a giant planet that is breaking apart.  Already in multiple pieces, passing our sight lines at its' random intervals.  The birth of a ring."
i would expect it to be an issue with the star itself it is not a planet....
"sp.READ the WORDs <3
it's illegal to use a legal name
google: legal name fraud"
one thing im wondering about could it not have been some sort of black hole or more then one passing by that could bend light away from earth receiving it ?
CGI has really improved
all of these TED things are bullshit.
This what happens when you don't show the Cronulons what you got.
"This was Awesome :D
Thank you for your data sharing"
Clearly the borg or replicators :)
'the data were good' - i know its right but it feels so wrong :S
Kepler is a lie
bullshit
Rouge planets and stars travle in straight line unless and/or until affected by another mass signifcantly large enough to change it's path. At the distance they're talking about space is mostly devoid of mass.
"Maybe what we are witnessing is not something orbiting that star, but something orbiting us. Now who's to say it is not."
"Rouge planet or star, Either will do the job!"
"It doesn't have to be debris or an object in orbit around the star... It could be much closer to home, an object in our own vicinity moving between us and Tabby's Star. Given that our own star is massively surrounded by a cloud of debris, we should be expecting to see events like this very often as our own crap intermittently blocks what we see out there. AND, the events would be non repeating, seemingly random and without pattern. A very small object on our side can cause a massive dip in light in the observed star, even a total temporary blackout. In fact, any sufficiently large object anywhere in the light path from here to there can cause the same effect. Space is not empty. Just a thought."
"It could be black holes between the star and our planet.  They'll absorb the light.  I'm not sure how slow black holes ""move"" through space, but it's a better explanation than ""aliens blew up a planet.""

Heck there are so many things which could explain this, concluding that aliens did it is irresponsible."
"More fascinating than this talk is reading a bunch of comments from armchair 'scientists' who have been educated just enough to think they can understand what is happening, but not educated enough to see how their own hypothesis fail."
"Is it possible for that "" object "" to be a Jupiter size planet ( or bigger ) with huge moons orbiting around it on different axis.... There is an amazing space simulator "" game "" called Universe Sandbox 2 that can be used to simulate different things...."
"I'm reminded of the first book in Peter F Hamiltons Commonwealth saga, Pandoras star!"
"I'm not saying it's aliens

but it's aliens!"
"What if that sun is much more,  active then ours ? What if it had much much more sunspots that dimmed the entire sun light  ? We only now our own sun that's quiet cuz it's next to us. What if  some stars have really turbulent live ?"
"Umm... could it be that it's the result of numerous bodies? 
Some small, some huge, some massive, some with moons, some without....
I think about what our system might look like from the correct perspective..... Seems not entirely dissimilar."
What about this - not a Dyson sphere (which should make the star invisible) but rather a civilization that has constructed several arrays of space-based solar panels that beam energy to a planet? Perhaps there are even several of them of varying sizes as the technology to build them changes. These combined with several planets in the plane of our eliptic _might_ cause these odd effects.
how far is this star from earth?
"Basically some very smart astronomers made sure their paper had the right keywords to get coverage and attention from popular media and scientifically illiterate but ""LOVE SCIENCE"" crowd."
"Bad talk, bad conclusions. I feel bad for the university that employs her."
Intellectual women are so-o-o-o sexy! I can't help it.... sorry.
omg a sjw free ted talk.
"What is she smoking? And where can I get some? Alien structures bigger than Jupiter? That's pretty big. More likely it's some natural structure, or cluster of structures, or cloud of structures, but no... this is the aliens again. Sells a lot more copy that way. But, not to worry... we are looking at this star system as it WAS millions of years ago. Who knows what is ""there"" right ""now"" anyway? As usual, it only exists in our minds, nowhere else."
"But, come on, ""wtf"" is not an ""acronym"". :/"
Science is so philosophical... :)
"I'm not a scientist neither are you. space is debatable.  their is no real pictures, get over it. I'm a free American that questions everything. I will fight for it and defend with casualties.  I will not be herded up like sheep and be lied to. I'm free. are you? 
ps you are a prisoner."
Its pretty obvious that it is a star gate like in '2001 A Space Odyssey'. End of debate!
lol.
There is only one alien that we know of that was not from this planet and His name is Jesus
"Sounds like it wasn't the star that was mysterious but the ""thing"" that passed in front of it!"
fix the computer algorithms to detect the occurrences more reliably for a start. More data the merrier!
are we having fun yet......we are only limited by our imagination
It would be great to see some real space photos instead of these digital imaginations
"Science is a cup already full of it's own ideas and it leaves no room for whatever may be out there for it to add to the cup. Like a child, science picks and chooses what it wants to fill it's cup with, thereby lacking the openness necessary to consider the entirety of the true purpose of science which is to discover everything that is for science to discover and not to dismiss offhandedly anything not a part of the current status quo. The ancient knew of things that modern science is only just rediscovering and pride in the scientific community reflects upon their opinion of the ancients and whatever technology they may or may not have had. I do not disagree with this scientists interpretation of the data she has been speaking of as I have no method for my own interpretation of it myself. I have not seen the data. I would, however, not be so certain that anything was of a natural origin in this universe. Especially something of such a questionable particular such as this unusual star.Dave"
"What if there simply is a more advanced species than ourselves out in space, utilizing giant, yet somehow ""invisible"" megastructures, which can't be seen normally, but does in fact block or dim star light/brightness? Think of all the ""voids"" in space with no viewable planets in them, yet these voids have a particular shape to them, like a circle or perhaps even square or rectangular; it would appear they're practically ""structured"" or ""manufactured"" in some way. I think that some scientists make the error of believing that  EVERYTHING, no matter what something is, or where it is (including outerspace), must follow the same rules of physics as things (and people), here on earth; in actuality, I'm pretty certain that if there were an ""advanced civilization"" in the cosmos, they'd have already created methods to circumvent what we on earth ""know"" as the ""law of physics."" The very nature of some of the unbelievable observations reportedly observed would support such a possibility. And in any case,wouldn't it be somewhat arrogant to believe we as humans are the only intelligent beings in the universe, at our level of knowledge? There are most likely millions or even billions of other ""civilizations"" far more advanced than we could even imagine."
"Wake up: even aliens could not build structures that are 100 times bigger than Jupiter. Where would they get the raw materials for that? Even if they manage to use all the raw materials in their solar system, it would not be enough. And if they have the technology to find them somewhere else, they won't need solar energy anymore!"
Guys... Be Practical.. it just may be a housefly in front of telescope ;)
Science fiction or what! Based on nothing but pure imagination. Then they put a spin on it to suggest it is real.
"That thing made by aliens on some of planet of that solar system to block solar radiation or sun blast,wat ever u call in scientific language,which damaging there electronic system n atmosphere."
"Could the asymmetrical dip in brightness (slower during the onset of dimming then faster in returning to original brightness) be possibly due to the mass/density of the transiting planet?  If the transiting planet had sufficient mass, wouldn't it cause its host star to also orbit slightly around the planet (common center of gravity/gravitational ""tug"") as the planet passes?  This slight orbital shift of the star could conceivably cause slowing during the initial transit phase and an acceleration during the exit transit phase from our point of view.  Yes?"
"hmm... what if the star has some weird, reverse, solar flaring on one side and, if the star is rotating, the anomaly was only observed when that side spun toward the telescope. That would, also, explain why the results were not uniform."
"How arrogant to say that ""The laws of physics say..."" as if to think we have anywhere NEAR a complete understanding of physics or anywhere near the understanding an alien civilization might have. HA"
"How do we know if it's not something closer to us that is blocking the light, instead of somethings orbiting the star? That way the objects that pass in front of the stars light, don't have to be that big. It may just be a couple of objects drifting in space, and not something in relations to that star"
could be a binary star system with a dark star orbiting a larger brighter star?
"Don't remember where I heard this, but what if there is a civilization out there more advanced than us, by 20 minutes? -g-"
"If they don´t know what is happening, them is a huge irresponsibility to give a talk about weird working hypothesis"
probably a swarm of co orbiting asteroids in the process of coagulation
maybe it is dark spots on that sun
Was a huge gas cloud infused with heavy elements that light is not able to pass through.

I find it funny that this video is very simple and easy to understand yet many people in the comment section seem to disagree.
Blame the Vogons!
There is nothing out their you morons. We are totally unique and never will be replaced.  We will move away from Mother Earth hoping to extend life because man has destroyed it.  Mankind as it exists does not deserve another  planet if one could support life.
I wonder what it is.
"I just ask myself, why come up to talk to the crowd about assumptions and no solid evidences especially when 90% of the crowd probably cant understand more than 5% of what she is talking about!! haha"
Why the dislikes? And the amount of pseudo-scientists in the comments is overwhelming.
everything NASA does is contrived
Who knows if the data is real? ...these days everything scientific needs no evidence... just talk. be careful people.
ok boy. run home now. tell mommy the kids on the field don't play fair. haha.
"I know, how about we blast mathematical equations in binary, embedded in radio waves, cruising into outer space at the speed of light.  Now if there's anything else out there they can triangulate our position.  Oh that's right, we already are doing this. Lol. Best idea in history."
How about. It's a rogue red dwarf star just crashing into another planet/dwarf star.
Interesting  data but no conclusion possible
she mentions Carl Sagan quote....and she only shows computer generated images! hahaha
ik wil een ruimte geschut maken dat van planetoide naar plantoide kan schiet maar zichzelf dus ook dat het zichzelf een zet geeft naar de volgende stuk en dat steeds verder totdat de brokstuk klein is gemaakt en hij zich weer verder verplaatst en dan steeds dat wat die brokstuk is kleiner en kleiner dus maakt maar ik zeg steeds dicht bij iets brengt van bronkstuk naar brokstuk totdat bijvoorbeeld mars een dikke laag dikker is geworden zoiets zit ik mij voor ogen te halen een hele reeks ruimtegeschut dat gewoon de hele tijd met electriciteit de stukje puin ergens heen schieten van puin naar puin en wellicht van geschuit naar geschut ik weet alleen niet of daar een belang in is het kan mij alleen gefantaseerd worden dat is wat ik graag doe
what a lot of mumbo jumbo!!!
"Wouldn't it be wonderfully refreshing to have more than one or two scientists, or just two intelligent everyday blokes out here, on Earth, say: I have no idea what may be causing this unusual pattern of dimmed light in its transit around its sun, but hope one day our knowledge will be advanced enough to know what it is or what it means!"
can we please just have a picture of our Earth that's real? thank you.
why do everyone assume that an old alien race would exaust all their natural resourses ? maby they just wanted to try somthing else for energy.. maby we should too..
What bout very large planet with many very large moons orbiting? Could easily explain those findings. Surprised that nobody mentioned this very first idea..
Interesting topic. Why do I hate this woman?
Dense gas cloud
"can explore any where you like with your satellites leave my ships alone .oh wait thats right , flat earthers claim satellites and space don't exist .. I have nothing to worry about .what a relief ,ok crew keep collecting the energy off of that star so we can go to the milkyway and extract all the gold off the earth ..."
Did they get the radio telescope to check this star out from their proposal?
It's good to have an imagination but this is a gross misinterpretation of data.
Dark matter
"I'm not a scientists, but I think it's your momma."
Non Sense... get to work you dumb scientists. there may be many planets of the said star and they might circle the star at the same rate at different orbits and they all cross the star at the same set of time hence the opaque time elongates and you see a great dip in light.. imaginary Americans .. always aliens aliens...
Why not black hole? This was not mentioned. Would appreciate any comment on this.
"And if somehow there is some megastructure made by sentient beings, what would they need all that power for? I don't think it's computation or something in that regard. Things have become fairly efficient here even with our ""low-tech"" civ. Only thing I could think of is powering something able to travel to another star. Perhaps beaming power to a ship in transit. Other than that, something purposely built like a beacon to be observed. And that would be fairly bold too.

And I'd be curious about their civ and tech level. A hive-mind type society might do much bigger things with lower tech than we'd expect. Resources wouldn't be wasted on squabbles and wars if the whole planet was entirely unified. All that effort could instead be spent on expansion. (Certain things we'd automate might be separated by purpose-bred castes or something like that in their society. Really foreign to how we do things.) But are they that way, or are they more tech developed?"
Imagine a group of planets forming.  Rocky belts that are clumping together.
"no no no , its a giant starbeast farting coke bubbles in his banana jacuzzi."
"How about this - ""New"" life forms are already here. Have been for a long time."
"An alien explanation ""would be"" a natural explanation. Whatever happens in the universe is just the universe unfolding."
Aliens
Can a planet be 5 or 10x the size of it's sun?
"Well there is for sure alien life but unfortunately we will probably never meet an alien due to the fact that our life span is too short for the universe.
We have to be alive at the same time as another alien life form and that life form has to be interested by us and have the capacity to reach us."
"Wait what? She said ""scientists are meant to publish results"" ..... when did they start doing that then? 

Listen, the star has a faulty electrical connection. It just needs tightening up and it will be good to go. The sooner scientists realize the universe and everything in it is electrical, the sooner they will find proper and correct answers to some of it's mysteries.  Until then, all we will get is bucket loads of stupid theories resulting from their ridiculous imagination."
Is she on crack?
"We have been monitoring KIC 8462852 (the WTF Star) and we have detected nothing that could even be misconstrued as intelligence.  A Dyson sphere is a hypothetical structure completely encompassing a star presumably in the comfort zone of a star that is quite a bit larger than our sun, just think about that for a moment. I think SETI is trying to produce an imaginary alien for us (like an imaginary sky fairy) since they (understandably) cannot find any real ones of their own."
Ort Cloud analog?  I figure we're seeing diffraction fringes.
nope it was a alien invasion of the star system.
Could be just really huge sun spots.
"why are we pointing radio telescopes at anything no alien spices that has gone interstellar would be using radio anything any more as it would take far to long to communicate anything and the time it would take for us to get any thy made in the past would take far longer that the light from their sun which we are just now getting thy would be using quantum entanglement or spooky action at a distance to create a quantum entangled network bridge that would not only be a secure line of communication it would also be instantaneous just by entangling 240 q-bits we could make a 128 but quantum entangled network bridge that would have 0 lag in data transfer you could communicate across any distance in the know or even unknown universe without any delay in transition 

i don't know why we are wasting time on the quantum CPU when we should be working on the quantum network bridge its simpler to make and has more practical applications"
It's not rocket science. It's a mini fluctuating black hole that moves around the star like a planet. The other fluxes are the space junk that it pulls in.
"9:34 O.k., you're straying a little out there, but this is fine.
11:05 You're brushing that off a little too easily.
11:23 Oh, come on! Did you get stoned, and just kinda freestyle the end, there?
12:07 O.k., we're back on Earth."
Is it massive enough to cause the star to wobble? Captured  black hole or would that omit a lot of EM?
"hey just a thought , what if a rogue planet or an asteroid somewhere in the middle of that star and us, nearer to us in interstellar space is causing that dip just as i can block the sunlight with my hands thats falling on me.
It depends on the point or co-ordinates from where we collected data , maybe if we observed that star from another star system or a really far of place the dips may not appear . 
That weird shape may be of an asteroid .
The size of shadow depends also depends on distance between the source of light and the object also distance between that object and observer   .
so we might get a 15% dip or more blocking  if something closer to us is blocking the light from that star."
it could have been Santa Clause.
Hmm interesting! if a planet had rings like Saturn and its moon did as well and the rings faced towards us and the system was bigger than Jupiter it could be another explanation.
"Where do you get the energy to build a Dyson Sphere, when you're out of energy. Couldn't you make a giant magnifying glass to capture and or direct energy without a big space thingy? How did the aliens get this Dyson plan past right winger aliens, a.k.a. ""deniers?"" So many questions."
"awe, I didn't want it to be over."
"Kent Brockman: ""I for one, welcome our new alien overlords."" But seriously, this is exciting, but I'll bet anything it's natural. Wait a minute! I've got it. What we are seeing may two massive planets orbiting each other and their sun. And maybe they have a retinue of large satellites. Combine the light dip from these with the possible influences of other planets in the system traversing the primary at the same time and...? And, are they sure it's not another, very dim star, perhaps with planets, that is the cause?"
Someone clean the sensor please. lol
"Comets feel a little contrived...
ALIENS"
"ohh wait, I don't like the ""a structure like this would produce a lot of heat"" argument. Yeah, if you're a stupid race called 'humans' that can only produce 10% efficient machines. If an alien civilization can produce a Dyson Sphere, they can make 90% efficient machines at least"
"""The data were good""

I hate English"
Can anybody explain to me why it couldn't be something closer to earth that might have passed in front of the star? like something in the oort cloud?
"ooooo.....the Death Star! May the 4th be with you
...always
   XD"
Who disliked this video?
ted talks is getting shitier more and more seriously why do you brought up the aliens on the table in the first place you just have to squeak that you know about dyson spheres didn't you ? there could be hundreds of explanations without involving aliens it could be a donut shaped planet or maybe the star is in a tidal locking or its a binary system with a brown dwarf
has any one thought about objects local to us causing the dips in brightness? seems like the only plausible explanation to me.
its superman
"For anyone wondering, that star is 'only' 1480 lightyears away. Pretty close actually. Our galaxy is an estimated 120K lightyears across.

Since this got out they checked the star for gamma rays and two different teams checked for radio signals, nothing. They also did spectroscopy and spectral energy distribution analysis on that solar system, also nothing. One would imagine that megastructures would leave some other form of detectable trace to pick up than just its shadow we detect.

So my guess is, it's comets or some other form form of gigantic 'natural' phenomena ... still pretty exciting. I hope we will find out more in may '17, when the next dimming is expected.

Oh BTW, consider this: Because it's about 1.5K lightyears away, everything we have observed in the last few years and will observe in the future in that system, actually happened in the 6th century."
"Sounds to me like KIC 8462852 has some serious asteroid belts. 
Anyone care to plan a route? My autopilot seems unable to do it, or its in jovenian space."
"I was wondering do researchers like Tabetha find the distant telemetry that all our information is based on to be primitive?  I mean scientific speculation has never been greater and she's standing there explaining that planets have to pass between us and the light source because interruptions in the line graph are our only way of knowing they exist; astronomy that is decades old.  So they are considering an alien civilization solely because the object is large?  There are retired physicists who wanted to pursue Einstein's relative field theory as a source of propulsion during the Space Race wondering why our technology is still rocket-based, and claims that men living today have completed Einstein's equations and no one knows it; so why is Stephen Hawking funding a billion-dollar project to look for radio signals?"
"No flat earthers in the comments, I'm totally shocked.They always put their two cents in,consider yourself lucky."
"Still can't wait for the day we find astonishing, irrefutable evidence of aliens from another solar system"
In all actuality I like the idea of a trinary star system with two brown dwarfs in orbit whith each other with a hugely elliptical  (and rotating) orbit around the star we've been observing
"I really admire these scientists, and citizen scientists for their patience and perseverance. Great story and presentation. 
My only complaint is that it's too short lol."
13.7 billion light years across and we are the only intelligent life in existence?
Alien Donal trump must be building a wall on the southern border of their star system. It is the ONLY explanation that works
The presupposition here is that the only way the light from stars can fluctuate is if something is blocking the light. Rather than questioning our theories of stellar mechanics we'd rather speculate about aliens. My friends this is not science it's a load of crap and it's time for folks to wake up and refuse this kind of lazy research and demand real science.
"Too much bullshit conjecture. First half, interesting, latter half, not so much."
"I feel like I was just watching science for 6 year olds.  ""Science"" cannot really explain stars, gravity, black holes or galaxies and virtually everything we ""know"" about astronomy are guesses.  The quote at the beginning should say ""Extraordinary claims require zero proof and guesses"".   You watch a light in the sky which flickers once in a while and you assume it's a planet.  Then all of a sudden the light is fluctuating erratically so it must be an alien race blasting the planet with death rays and then harvesting the debris for recycling purposes.  Of course there is also zero evidence of the existence of extra-terrestrial life.  lol.....Or maybe its a giant green martian holding out his hand in front of the star for a joke.  Which is what this video is.....a big joke for people who believe they are ""educated"".   Yep.....well educated on lies and guesses."
What if it's just a planet with a huge ring system?
how about gamma waves?
"is there any recent news on this? i remember they announced it early this year, so just wondering if they have any new information?"
"wtf, ted will let any old talk these days...."
Talk about stars and Tech all you want at TED......But don't mention the poor!
can we be witnessing a star dying?
"Shouldn't even bring up aliens. How about this: If that star has a brown dwarf twin (or has more than one other companion star that's not in visible light) could it have many small to medium sized planets associated with the brown dwarf, big enough to cause the brightness irregularities that were observed? Then when the very large brown dwarf comes in between Earth and the bright star, the very deep dip in brightness might occur."
"I don't know anything about outer space but I just wanted to share my POV.
what if the dip was caused by a star or a planet revolving really really slow around this particular star.
Please do reply about my ignorance in the matter."
"however, if we could send a small drone to speed up there fast, it would realize that maybe there is nothing there, as the light we see is so many years light away, that at this absolute moment, that place look very different from now. the time it takes to go there, and then transmit the video to earth, even light speed it would take many years extra. actually distance is a time machine. there is a place very far away from earth where the light from the times of jesus christ is starting to arrive, and if you have a good telescope, you could zoom and see in real motion, jesus moves on earth, or the time of dinosaurs... its all a mater of distance from earth, light years away. So in a way light is a time machine for the past, you jusy need to move on the right 3D (x,y,z) space dimension. this also imply that if you aproach an object fast so many years away  you would stack up time, and it would appear to speed up the ""scene events"" light carries, because you are stacking light years proportionality to the speed and distance  from observed position."
Did nobody actually think of planets with a couple hundred of moons?
As per usual...its all guesswork...and definitely not relevant to our way of life on earth.Pity we don't have passionate people protecting this planet instead of stargazing andwondering whats going on out there. Its as helpful as pondering your belly button.
"problem solved: CROMULONS were watching rick and morty getting schwifty, so they were blocking the star light."
What if your seeing a debris field of a planet that has broken up and still following the same orbit ?
"TED talks.  They'll let this fly, just don't mention Graham Hancock or Rupert Sheldrake.  
Also - if how could Aliens use a Dyson Sphere if they've never come to Earth and met Dyson?  huh?  CHECK MATE ATHEISTS!"
Sounds like the star ITSELF is dimming. Not something getting in the way. Is this possible? Perhaps this is the start of the end of the star? anyone know what life stage the start is in?

"So, give amateur astronomers data that is [omitting] key information, and ask them to examine it and draw to conclusion based on important, primary, missing keys. If we believe we are on a ball because we see balls above us. . . if we believe we are on a spiral because we see a spiral. . . if we have never SEEN a curve with our eyes when looking at the [physical] earth, but only see a curve when looking at IMAGES. . . then we will also BELIEVE that all computer data is collected, and not written.

i bet it was just huge pieces of matter floating through space between the star and the Kepler's data capturing instruments.
were so close to finding lifeforms
Could this be something as simple as very large sun-spots that crop up on this star?
have any commenters here actually been in space? or just believe people with money's bullshit?
The asymmetrical dip reminds me of the slightly asymmetrical look of far-away galaxies because of the finite speed of light. Maybe the apparent asymmetry can be explained by a supermassive object - maybe a small black hole - moving at a relativistic speed so that the euclidean approximation of spacetime doesn't apply. A bit similar to how the air pressure peak caused by a fast spinning ball going past is asymmetrical wrt. time. Did the spectral peaks remain constant during the luminance dip?
Sooo much bullshit !!
Just fell asleep
"what about ""several planets"" orbiting that star, and our Kepler just happened to observe the star at its rare moments of planets alignment !!"
It's a planet with moons going around it passing in front of the star. That's why you get multiple variable dips in the light.

lol aliens built structures bigger than Jupiter. okay................ #science believe what your told because science
could it not be just a planet with a massive orbital path making the light dim not because it's big but because it's further from the star than thought. if you look at Jupiter blocking 1% of the light between the sun and the camera if Jupiter was nearer to the camera wouldn't it block out more light?

A paper titled wtf lmao
pretend astro physicists on youtube are giving lame explanations of big huge planets and moons. there is a limit beyond which planets cannot grow in size. you think astro physicists who spend their whole life observing celestial objects wont consider this option?
I think we should get Google's Deepmind to look at all the data and see what it comes up with. It might find things we have all missed.

"I've always wondered why people keep saying that a dyson sphere would be detectable because of the heat it produced, and that it's impossible to avoid this due to the law of physics. We're assuming that our understanding of the laws of physics is correct in the first place. What if the civilization that built such a structure figured out a way to not release all that heat and instead capture it? Or that our understanding of the law of physics is still relatively immature compared to a race that is capable of building a dyson sphere? I appreciated that she mentioned that the excess heat could have just been released not in our direction though. Gratuitous space battle would be my favorite explanation."
BULLSHIT - last thought that the neutron stars were aliens messages.
"Yes, a talk worth watching!!!!"

it's a giant alien spacecraft route. Giant crafts are flying in front of the star.

Ahh just shut up and go back to your lab and do your job. A whole lot of hype about virtually nothing.
even for an alien civilisation to cover a star with these super advanced  panels would create a huge resource problem and one planet alone cannot solve this problem. does all the planets in solar system can solve this problem? then also it will consume so much resources that they have to leave that solar system simply because of the resource problem that would be created after completion of this project of their's. even if it is an alien civilisation it is most certainly not planning to stay their after the completion of this.
Braggadocio. Changing your inner tone would give your words more weight.
"Maybe it is simply some type of huge sun spot and solar flare occurring, that could potentially create strange disparities in the light. You might say ""we don't have data to substantiate sun spots that big"" okay that is far but guess what else we don't have data to substantiate: Aliens! and we seem to hypothesize about them just fine."
The Dyson Sphere is a laughably ludicrous idea.
The shadow causing object does not have to be in orbit around the target star. Two objects in orbits around adjacent stars ( or just stray ) would give one shadow profile on entry and a different profile on exit. The objects do not even have to eclipse each other since we measure the total light from the star.

its a black hole...thats capturing all the light...
Wouldn't something getting closer block out more light .

She went from saying 1000s of comets (or meteorites) are unbelievable (like we don't have them in our solar system!? - kuiper belt, etc) to saying alien structures, each over 25 million miles wide are realistic. If nothing else, where did they get the material from to make all these structures?"
"This method of identifying orbiting planets is very limited, because it only sees planets passing between the star  and earth. If you look at a solar system model from the top, you see how this method fails, because since the planets go around, not above the star, it never makes a shadow."
"What a joke! Seriously people are so fucking stupid to believe this and the CGI that NASA gives us. These people will pay for deceiving the masses, maybe not here on Earth, but you can not hide God, and then take His place like this woman is here and get away with it forever. I would love to publicly debate her and the best and brightest at NASA...fucken liars"
All these readings are line of sight - wouldn't a small object block 1% or 15% of the light if it was the right distance away? in the same way as our small moon blocks out 100% of the sun in an eclipse even though it is far smaller than earth. So maybe in the line of sight there is a system with many orbiting bodies that just happens to block out the more distant star's signal?
"I am no astronomer but the graph shows a slight dip before the major transit, could this be a second planet that is partially blocked by the larger plannet."
What if the planet we're looking at has planets with smaller orbits in the solar system with variable sizes? So the dips in the line are caused by not one but many planets?
"As I see it, the problem with it being a structure to capture energy is that using up existing energy on a planet would be a gradual affair with increasing technology using less energy and gradually getting more directly from the Sun so other energy depletion would be slowing down all the time."
Anything that comes out from NASA should be taken with grain of salt(.)

Awesome thought provoking stuff ... !
could be a passing asteroid (cluster) comet or else from another (irregardless of distance) region just because it blocked the light doesn't mean it orbits
"Maybe it is really something wrong with that star. Maybe it doesnt function properly like all normal stars do, and by some reason the radiation that its produced  its delayed or reduced in its core.

"Bold statements from bullshit people... aww you humans, I wander how you made it this far... or how far you got lost in your empty space view."
There are Many planets that are right in front of us but unseen because they era outside of our visual light spectrum.
"One of the statements in this video article is that energy collectors in a Dyson Sphere would produce waste heat that our instruments could detect. I however do not think so! Why? Because a civilization that is advanced enough to build such a structure would obviously also be advanced enough to put any waste heat produced in this way to work for them. If it had become necessary to build a structure like this to maximize the amount of energy collected, it stands to reason that they would want to capture all the energy and put it to use, thereby preventing any kind of waste above a tiny fraction of a percent.

There is precedence for this theory being the case. Right here on Earth right now, we are developing such technology that takes waste heat from energy usage and puts it back into the system to increase the efficiency of energy use. So it is no stretch of the imagination to consider that this might be what is happening with this most definitely interesting star. In truth, it would seem to me that this is even more plausible that the comet cloud or asteroid cloud theory. Such clouds orbiting a star would want to reach an equilibrium in which they would form a ring, like the asteroid belt of our Solar System, or the rings of all the gas giant planets in the Solar System. What are the chances that such a cloud would have formed in the time period that allows the Kepler Telescope to detect it? I say billions if not trillions to one! But if a Dyson Sphere is the truth of this, the chances of it being in existence during the time of that Kepler mission would actually be far greater. I would not hazard a guess as to what the chances are, but I will say  that such a structure would be more likely to remain in existence for a much longer period of time than comet or asteroid clouds that act like this. Plus those types of clouds would be giving off detectable heat in the form of reradiated energy after being warmed by the star. As there is no significantly detectable heat, it must be something else.

Now I'm not saying that a Dyson Sphere is actually what this is; just that we should not count it out! We may be looking at the best evidence of Extra-Solar life ever found, so that avenue should not be abandoned until such time that there is proof positive that this could not be what this is. Every test we can develop that may help us learn whether this is such evidence must be implemented in order to see what the outcome will be."
"Either the star is dimming that much on it's own, which it seems stars can't do, or there's a problem in the space telescope itself. You need to go after the answers the require the least amount of craziness and throw those away first. Assuming somebody tested the results correctly can lead to trouble if they didn't test the results correctly. If I have a calculator that always gives the wrong answer except for 2+2 and I only check that 2+2 gives the correct answer then I'll be using faulty information I think is correct."
"WOW!!! Super ""*UNICORNS*"" from the institution of Science .... the establishment is political/personal and can't think past their own Theories that Gravity is the ""God"" of the universe. They must invent ""Stuff"" that explains their near-sightedness and attempts to explain *everything* from our limited human viewpoint. Variable stars are not new, but can't be explained by gravity, except to invent an impossible something to explain it: Neutronium! Puck was correct: What fools these mortals be ..."

Couldnt it be something much closer to earth in between earth and KIC?
"(To anyone it may concern...)
I am aware of the fact that the computers' main target was to find regular dips to be able to give sensical data (i.e orbiting planets). However, wouldn't it be of huge interest to also mark irregular dips of different sizes and abnormal curve-features as the one this star produces? Why wasn't this implemented and/or how come the computer was able to miss such interesting data-points? If anyone also know how they validated the data, please tell, it'd be really interesting to know!"

"It's not the STAR that's mysterious.  The mystery is in the objects passing between the star and us. Yes, objectS  Plural, not singular.  

And if you have multiple objects, why can you not have multiple explanations?  We could be observing multiple incidents.  It's a big universe - lots of stuff is happening.

As for the transition phase, there are actually TWO factors that determine the size of the ""pause,"" not just the size of the object.  The other is the SPEED of the object.  What if the orbit of the object is elliptical, and we are looking at one of the aphelion ends?  Then the object would spend more time between us and the star than if the orbit were shooting straight across or moving in a perfect circular orbit.   Furthermore, what if there are other celestial bodies orbiting the same star that affect the orbit of the first, causing that orbit to never be exactly the same.  This is how Pluto was discovered - by noticing its effect on Uranus & Neptune.  This would account for the different patterns moving into the pause and out of it.

As for the recent flurry of activity, that could be all of the celestial objects involved clustering between us and the star (similarly to how all of our planets just lined up recently) or other large objects flying through space.  I'd bet on the former.   Remember - just because most of our planets are on the same plane (or close to it), that doesn't mean the same must hold true for other solar systems.  If these celestial objects are on different planes, there might be no evidence of them orbiting the star until they all cluster between us and the star."
what if there's multiple planets that is crossing past the star with different periods? wouldn't that reproduce that light curve?
"9:00 ""so we have to find a way to rule out aliens""

It's nice to see it being used for real science as opposed to being fodder for ghost stories."

Couldn't it have been two planets with different orbital periods that align every so often?
So bored of the current paradigm. What is really up there?
death star
They forgot about other options like objects crossing path from observer to the star which aren't near star. They could first see actual planet orbiting this star and then something else somewhere on the path from observer to star was passing by and since it was closer to the observer than star it blocked more light than it would if it was closer to star.

"The bounds to which the human imagination can confabulate are limitless.  Send more money to these purveyors  of pie in the sky.   Hollywood can never compete with these scenarios.  More grist for the seemingly impossible.  

I await for the next fantastic tall tale."
"""Oops, the lens cap is still on."""
I would bet my money on a natural explanation for this phenomenon rather than any kind of alien activity.
"Perhaps it's a planet (or planets) orbiting another star that just happens to pass between us and that other star. I mean, that thing is nearly 1,500 light years away, so there's quite a few possibilities of what may be causing the disturbances."
"the dip is a result of a massive planet, having rings like saturn & being closer to us than we think, in orbit around the star in question, but far enuf out for the 15% dip to exist...."
Actual topic starts at 2:36
"Her attitude is we can't see it, we don't know what it is but wait, I'll tell you what my fantasy is about it and how it looks and the rest of the crap......Just report the facts."
"Well, it wouldn't be so ""awesome"" to discover the aggressors (winners) in that extraterrestrial war."
Maybe a black hole rotating so far around the star.
"""I don't know"" is one of the most important scientific principles."
It is strange- Can Hubble look at it?
"Even though i don't believe in aliens in any way shape or form, i enjoyed this video alot."
But... Couldn't it just be that we're so flipping far away from these stars that the light getting to us is subject to who-knows-what kind of interference? Occam's razor 101? Meh.
"My idea as far as the large variance in light is that the object is not extremely large but just far from the light source. As far as the major fluctuation, not a clue."
R'amen
I propose an icy moon is being eaten by a larger planet that is turning it into rings; like Saturn.  Please call me as I need a new telescope.
"If you had a large planet with several moons that would cause the irregular readout.  A moon behind the planet would not block any starlight, but when it swung out to the right or left of the planet it would block some sunlight causing an irregular read out.  If you had several moons circling the planet that would create an even more irregular readout as they dipped in and out from the shadow of the large planet."
i'm surprised a black hole wasn't included in one of the explanations?
NASA = Bullshit.
"Ridiculous speculation, based on almost no data."
could it not be a binary star system that we mistake as one. and the dip is seen when one star passes behind the other?
She reminds me of Leslie from The Big Bang Theory...
she has no idea how many exoplanets have been discovered. not even close...
This is the end of its solar system and planets slowly going to sunk into this star
NO. IT I DUE TO THE KESSLER SYNDROME. SPACE DEBRIS FLEW OVER THE KEPLER TELESCOPE!!!!
Alien civilization capable of dyson sphere... That is truly terrifying.
"""anything that uses a lot of energy is going to produce heat..."" unless they aren't *using* the energy. They could be storing it so they can survive the heat-death of the universe as long as possible."
"Graphic incorrect. As the orbiting object goes ""behind"" the star, from our perspective, the star's apparent brightness will increase. This is due to the object reflecting it's star's light towards the viewer (us). This means before and post the dip in brightness, there will be a surge. Very small but still relevant."
Hitting the dislike button for this vid?... Seriously internets?!...
Wow what a fascinating presentation! Whatever's going on in that system is demonstrably interesting and therefore worthy of further study
"What if outside the edge of the Observable Universe there is a Dyson Sphere sucking everything?
Dark energy? - Solved!
Big Bang? - Solved!
Pre Big Bang? - Solved! 
Science too EZ..."
"Climate change, obviously."
"If planet is very far away from star wouldn't that also block more light, idk like a finger blocking the moon..."
What about a triple planet system orbiting the star? You could get weird light curves depending on how the planets are orbiting each other as they pass in-front of the star.
"What if It's a huge alien spaceship of doom headed RIGHT to our planet in the solar system? Might explain why it is blocking out more and more light from the star! 
I'm scared now."
So let me get this straight..... There's a star that could have potential life near it or its this big mystery and could be some crazy new info.... And we just give up on it and start searching for new stars... Give me a break that is a humongous amount of b.s
"Damn TED, learn difference between GALAXY and UNIVERSE! She clearly said Galaxy!"
"Simple answer to this. If it's a artificial structure have Kepler monitor it for 2 to 3 cycles. When complete compare the data from each cycle. If there is a similar pattern between each cycle then the ""structure"" is fixed and artificially created."
"If an alien civ had the power to build a Dyson Sphere, it stands to reason that we should be able to track down multiple Dyson Spheres, either in the same galactic region or based on similar star types. That's what I'd be looking for, anyhow, to rule out the Dyson Sphere hypothesis.

Although if you've harvested one star, how much energy could you possibly need that you'd have to harvest multiple stars? You'd think they'd discover a more efficient means of energy production at that point.

Maybe on their evolutionary course they built a Dyson Sphere around one but ultimately abandoned it because they progressed beyond the need for more.

Someone smarter than I should solve this so I don't have to suggest cracked theories."
I found that 8 of those star hunter names were hungarian. Isn't that intresting?
"The most likely natural explanation seems to be the ""twin Jupiters"" hypothesis. A proto-star with gigantic low density moons at least the size of Saturn. That would give a huge assymmetrical signal. It would also make the star wobble quite a lot. Does it do that? ... Mmm. Ok. I'll just look this stuff up. There's too little information in this talk. It's just a bait. And I'll take it."
The universe is just a huge time eater...
"Hats off to Amateur Astronomers, doing the work computers can't, that's the real story here!"
I love how they named a paper WTF XD
Refueling at the sun.
"Just think, to all other life in the Universe, Earthlings would be aliens in the way all locals believe anyone else who moves to their city are migrants, or anyone moving to their nation are aliens. Are we aliens? To the rest of the Universe, we are. There. I just discovered aliens, who have drones, and kill millions of people. Problem solved. There is alien life in the Universe."
"The most mysterious star is the Sun, no question, hands down. We can study life on Earth right here. Is there life on Earth? Yes. Is there life in the Universe? Yes. Right here. Our Sun is so important we worshipped it. Pharaohs believed the Earth was flat, at the center of the Universe, where the Sun circles the Earth, put here by Creator God. Hebrews copied Egyptians, Christians copied Hebrews, Muslims copied Hebrews and Christians, with their Earth centered cosmology. We are special because Creator God put us here, at the center of the Universe. Sadly, Egyptians, Hebrews, Christians, and Muslims all got it dead wrong. Earth is not the center. We are not special. We are insignificant like fleas or mosquitos. Still, our star has fueled life on Earth and fueled the rise of life and all we have. This makes our star, the Sun, the most mysterious."
Need more data to be absolute convincive...  Just theories with not a practical prof but expeculations
Tabetha.... BoOya!!!
"It's just god playing dice and working mysterious, no biggie"
how about it's the actual start dropping in brightness and not something blocking it?  no glow from material because there's no material orbiting
Or maybe we are seeing the interaction of matter with 4 dimensional space - from a skewed angle - resulting in asymmetry.  This may simply be the observation of a point in our cosmos that is connected with a 4th dimension.
"How about a Super-Giant planet with a few huge natural satellites (moons) close enough in its orbit to the planet (blocking the star in a pear shaped side by side way) to disturb the graph in that irregular 'asymmetrical' way in its transit.
Or a binary star system with a brown dwarf and its own planets orbiting an active star (is there a noticeable pull??)"
"""Comets sound ... A bit contrived, but aliens however..."""
Sun spots. Most  likely answer.
after 10 min she gets FULL NA
"Guys its 1480 light years away!!  What we are seeing today happened these many years ago and whats happening right NOW just cannot be observed, Relativity is playing like a wild kid with our intuitions..."
"Stupid thing what she said in the end 'western don't have much facilities for this'  Hahaha 
😂😂😂😂"
"Doesn't matter what we believe, we will be told what to believe."
our science is very very simple. the laws of physics that we know are not laws but very basic starting points that we take as the facks. we know nothing at this point we are still learning. that being sed iif some civilization could build a disowns sphere or could actually designee one. long before that the civilization would have found a way to use 99 to maybe even 100% of the energy and would have no waste. again we know nothing and the law that we say seas that can not happen is only an idea compared to the vastness of knowledge that witch we know nothing about.and since we are so new to this science and easily corrupted from being scientist we are probably wrong!!! or in some aspect right.
I don't understand how it's less likely to be aliens than some odd tailor-made hypothesis to do with a gigantic swarm of comets which has never before been observed nor conceived of or accounted for until they were necessary to avoid considering alien megastructures.
"Personally, I would have called the talk: Benefits of involving the public in evaluating Keppler sattelite data. I would not have put that strange star at the center of my talk without a solution to the problem."
What if you had 3 or 4 planets on the same orbit path around the star and at the same time they were spinning around each other wouldn't that create the strange effects? And if the planets were different sizes that would just add to the anomalies.
what about blobs of dark matter
I know that´s probably a dumm question but what about Starspots I mean usually they are way too small to have such a big impact on the brightness but when we are already talking about aliens we should also at least think about that!?
Fear the Great Old Ones!
very boring explanation and doesn't even seem that fascinating..
"More than one POV, with the majority being ""right"" .  Is this one side of the string theory,  or merely a fiber?"
"She makes an invalid conclusion at 6:10 ""Something in space was getting in the way and blocking starlight..""  This arbitrarily precludes any theories which might say that the star itself is unstable.  Who knows, maybe this is something that happens to near solar mass sized stars right before they start their expansion phase."
"What if it was multiple planets with very close orbits, so that sometimes two (or more) planets are superimposed unpon eachother. This could explain why the light gradually dims more and more, a planet in a closer orbit is moving faster than one in a farther away orbit. As the closer planet is moving out from behind the farther away planet, the shadow cast would slowly become larger until the two planets are completely separated, which would also explain the quick jump back up to expected levels."
Who knows what the deal is with it or anything else until you just go there... ... Kepler only gives you so much to work with...
"Dear Tabetha,  Thanks for a great, mind opening talk.

Please accept my suggestion as to the irregular transits of this star.  It is my opinion that the star is not the center of its system, rather it is the third or fourth Planet out from an even more massive central object.  The transits are the other planets in the same system.  We are very lucky to be viewing this system edgewise, but precession will make the whole scene quiet for long periods.

Thanks."
I like the idea of two large gas giants in orbit around each other
I dont understand how people so many people dont find this interesting.. though i guess its for the same reason i dont like certain things others like. I just like to imagine what our civilization would become if a majority of us were interested in astronomy or just science in general. war would not exist
6:06 and... the data were good
the strange dip might be caused by planet and it's moon.
Sun Spots.
"It's not a star, its the blinking eye of a giant cosmic space hamster."
"How about, a fast-spinning planet got hit by an asteroid and shatters, creating a disc of debris, at a 45 degree angle to us on both the x and y axis."
i feel like sometimes folks need to be reminded that there has not been any evidence of life anywhere besides earth.
why was it so sudden though...did they build this megastucture in the matter of months?. How do you explain it seemingly normal behavior beforehand
"Yet another deceptive title on a YouTube video. The speaker said ""ONE OF THE MOST mysterious stars in our GALAXY,"" not ""the most mysterious sstar in the universe."""
"Check your premises Mr. Rearden. The assumption everyone is using is that something is orbiting the star and periodically blocking star light. If something were very far away from the star (like in interstellar space) and also along our line of sight, that something could be small and block most or even all of the star light."
If they were not ready to see giant flying chunks of matter; they should have listened to me and not pointed the Kepler telescope through my bathroom window.
"Welcome to the Objective Absurdity of ""pouring from the empty, into the void"". ;0)"
2 words -> black hole
Sounds like an asteroid belt.
One must prove there are aliens before concluding what they are seeing is from aliens. Thats a big jump from we don't know the answer yet to lets decide its something we haven't proved outright yet. Its kind of like concluding god before proving god.
Is that a tea cozy?
I'm not saying it was aliens... but it was aliens
Not one ounce of true science in any of this circus.
could it not be remains of a broken planet or asteroids ?
"11:33 just a bit sad how every scientist STILL has to make it a giggle laughing matter everytime they bring up potential alien life. They just still dont dare to be serious about it, still gotta vent their ""shame"" by cracking a little Star Wars joke at the end.
Why? Isn't it time we mature as a civilization and stop giggling about what is already seriously considered to be statistical fact, that we're impossibly unlikely to be alone in the galaxy?
You dont have to crack a nervous joke about it anymore. It's time to grow up."
They're coming.
My guess is Jupiter sized planets with large moons the moon enters the disk first then the planet as the planet transverses the star the moon gets between the planet and the star. This would account for the gradual slope down and the fast slope up. Planets with moons also explains the other crazy reading.
"I am reminded of the historic words of the great C. W. Moss:  ""Dirt in the carburetor – just blowed it away!"""
"At 2:39 she says "" . . . one of the most mysterious stars in our galaxy."" That's a far more modest claim than the video's title promises."
this by far is the best ted talk ever. She could have spoken science but what she chose to do was show star wars
There are quadrillions of inhabited outposts on primary spheres and moons here in the MW so this isn't  that big of a deal. Humans have such a frontyard complex. The cosmos can never be your infinite frontyard. Massively stubborn people you are.
You know it's time to switch off when she specifically uses 'data' in the plural form.
"I dont understand, that solar system is lightyears away from us, couldnt it be that multiple objects passes trough our line of sight? I mean you could block our sun completely with a quarter dollar in your fingers, tiny moon can block all of the light during solar eclipse. Coudnt random space rock fly trough our line of sight tousands miles away?"
maybe the sun itself is causing it. sunspots or maybe even an unstable core or something.
"Anyboby anywhere think the fact that we cuold onli see the planet in front of the star, if the planet, the star, and us (kepler) , are in the same line. Think about how many planets in the these sistems arent observables because of this. It's just a litle chance to see what really hapenen in each sistem. What about the plenti of planet in each star that his orbit dont cross in front of his sun from our perspective."
Maby the planets were aligning
"Scientists, the self-appointed gods of our age, allow themselves too much claptrap."
"""Planets don't get bigger than Jupiter"" Oh yes they do.  That was a very ""this is a flat earth"" comment."
"""the data were good"""
"what about micro/dust metorites just in front of kepler?
could it be a proto star or white/black dwarf that rotate around a existing star?"
"Finally I get an explanation of this! I've been waiting for scientists to figure this star out!

Wait... they still don't know?"
drop in current flow. No big deal
"As shameless as this is, it is an unfortunate fact that astronomers are constrained to including alien hypotheses to generate public enthusiasm (i.e. funds) for what they do.  By 'unfortunate' I am not necessarily meaning that they should get dibs on science funding.  How much taxes 'ought' to go to pure science research is debatable.  It is just unfortunate to watch them have to prostitute themselves out this way.  This woman knows 100% that the strange phenomenon is not aliens.  And so do her colleagues.  In the end one would think that the aphrodisiac of alien hypotheses would backfire.  But it won't.  As long as cosmic human loneliness exists they will be able to use it to generate enthusiasm."
Why did you HAVE to find a way to rule out aliens? What about a massive fleet of planet-sized starships?
"Wonderful lesson, wonderful teacher."
Could the star just be unstable and on the verge of transitioning into a red giant as its remaining supply of hydrogen is almost completely consumed ? The output of a star like that would be unpredictable and cause the dips in output that we observe.
We probably live in an alternate universe where those poor sods got selected to be terminated to make room for a new hyperspace express route.
"Could be a a black hole orbiting a star? Or the star must be rapidly running out of fuel? Or too many black spots occurring on the star and going away? Also I read somewhere, that planets can be bigger than Jupiter. O.o"
Sounds like BS
"I keep fantasizing about a bonafide alien discovery, even a 50% chance of a discovery being something alien related gives me major goosebumps!!"
"Extraordinary claims require SHOULD require the same evidence as anything else, otherwise you have left objectivity behind you."
What if it's not a massive object near that star but instead an Earth (or whatever) sized object in between us and that star.
Russian language please)
You are probably watching the beginning stages of a planet taking shape. There. I did it.
aliens are real there are 1072 underground cities
"while citizens were watching what was going around stars millions of light years away,  they were robed from their freedom, privacy, and natural food resources."
Ted talks take tooo fucking long to explain what they are trying to explain
"So, what of January-May 2015? In an orbit of ca 700 days a footprint of 100 days is the distance to the Lagrange Point Trojans... so, it could be a planet-forming nebula planar-gyrating over the pull of a second major planetesimal (maybe at, the Lagrange point)..."
Could be a few starts in different sizes lined up making it look like this?
"Anyone else find this terrifying? The size of the universe, the possibility of aliens, the strange patterns. sp00ky"
"What if it's just a huge meteorite or moons trailing along a huge huge planet? And what if the planet is breaking apart into chunks because of the material it's made out of? Not all planets will break and produce dust. Maybe it's aliens destroying a planet into parts to turn into material, easier to process when your planet is smaller in chunk. Maybe it's a huge robot machine traveling through space, when it reaches it's star destination, to harness energy it orbits around the sun and slowly breaks apart from mothership, to cover more area around the sun, this gradually happens over years to eventually cover the star, creating a Dyson Sphere. So many implications! Amazing discovery, if we find similar patterns in the future, we can start assuming it's another life form's work."
"How about planets that they're looking at from above? there's no planet passing through that axis to detect, it's orbiting on another axis and from our angle we can't see the transit. How do we detect those planets?"
im no expert but is it possible that it could be like an asteroid belt around the star??
cephid variable star?  For some reason the star's fusion reactor is unstable.  Possibly too many heavy elements in it's makeup so it has to expand and contract a lot but it does so randomly.
black hole/worm hole feeding on the light?
"First line of talk, ""my responsibility to remind people that alien hypothesis should always be a last resort."" Goes on to explain why it could not be aliens in this case. 
What YouTube heard, ""She is an idiot, she thinks aliens are responsible! She is a fake scientist. Astronomy is not science!"""
the explenation is alvays ice hahaha
Aliens are just as natural as asteroids and humans.
How massive can a planet be? Massive planets with varying elliptical orbits? Two or more of the planets orbits intersect between the sun and the telescope at the same time skewing the data? Massive asteroid passing between the sun and telescope? All questions no answers. I hate ted talks like this.
"As Ms. Boyajian stated, the laws of physics as WE understand them. We are finite beings in an infinite universe. Who are WE to think the universe must fit into our concepts of reality? As has already been noted below, ""The most incomprehensible thing about the universe is that it is comprehensible"" Albert Einstein from ""Physics and Reality""(1936), in Ideas and Opinions, trans. Sonja Bargmann (New York: Bonanza, 1954), p292. It is what it is.  Deal with it. Accept it. Reject it.  I prefer to be in awe of it."
I bet J.J Abrams is behind all this.
grasping. at. straws. how about we focus attention on the problems happening on this planet??
What if this star is e;ectric and the magnitude changed rapidly - as has happened before with other stars?
Maybe it's something really wrong with the star
"An interesting talk but I've got just one question.  At mins. 045 to 1:09 she speaks of NASA'S Kepler Mission and its duration, 4 years.  So, my question is this:  Why can't NASA relay a *continues* video feed of Earth rotating on its axis, 24/7?   Anyone who takes the time to *research* my question will find the Truth of the matter."
Brown dwarfs in orbit around this star. Duh!
Its the Necromongers. Riddick where are you?
"either we are alone or we're not, both perspectives are equally terrifying"
"Multiple planets, or a planet with many large moons along an elliptical orbit (which explains the gradual, asymmetric, light curve)."
And would u believe it that surprise surprise .. one of those people was Sagan himself.. Not dissing him just thought I'd say it.
Ok yeh sure ..  One should not jump to alien hypothesis necessarily .. But don't there's astronomers out there that won't even touch that hypothesis let alone leaving it on the back burner..
It was probably something or nothing or the opposite.
What about rouge planets?
"I guess we're stuck with ""ginormous"" as an official word now.  Thanks anonymous 10 year old."
"No comprendo ....  if the dips have no regularity, then it probably is nothing to do with anything orbiting that particular star.  Could be some debris field with moving dust clouds light years away from the star itself...."
its a speck of debris on the Kepler lens trolling us all
"Posters to this video have already thought of several genuine possibilities that the speaker didn't mention at all. 1. Objects moving between us and the star not associated with the star, 2. Dust and other unknown debris floating between us and the star, 3. Lone unattached planetoids passing in front of the star that are close to earth relative to distance of the star to earth. Why did she go directly to aliens or other weird guesses first? Where's the objectivity or broad-minded thinking?"
"they have definately discovered something, I think its a flaw with the method more than a discovery. Our current space technology is stone age level compared to how much we dont know. If you remember, we invented a lot of super natural ideas with our surroundings, this could be one of those moments."
"Thank you ,thank you, thank you ."
"But what is some kind of SOS signal? I mean MORSE ALPHABET? Everything is possible, and it can be a really good way to contact with other civilaztions, who are observing stars."
Probably changing light from some type of shimmer affect
What if the star in that solar system is completely different from what we know right now? For example the star could have circular rings like that of Saturn around it that are causing those dips in the light curve.
One of the greatest TED talks recently. :-)
"""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" is a claim, and an extraordinary claim at that...I would like some extraordinary evidence please."
"This woman is illogical if she believes that the statement ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" is true. If this statement were true, then we would never be able to believe any extraordinarily improbable events to have occurred as reported, even when we have actual evidence that such events have indeed occurred. 

For Example: The winning sequence of lottery numbers as reported by the Evening News. The Evening News claiming that this particular sequence of lottery numbers is the winning sequence is quite an extraordinary claim. This is because the probability of the event -- the particular sequence of lottery numbers -- has odds that are millions to one. If the Evening News must have extraordinary evidence in order for our belief in the what the Evening News has reported/claimed to be justified, then we would never be able to trust the Evening News. The requirement to provide extraordinary evidence would never be met by the Evening News. But on the contrary, we believe the Evening News' claim. Why is this? 

Well, for one, by the simple evidence of a video recording that shows the winning sequence being generated. And such a video recording is not ""extraordinary evidence"". Thus, the statement ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" is demonstrably false. 

This woman's type of illogical ""Saganized"" thinking would lead to sketicism to all sorts of highly improbable events, and should be thrown on the ground like The Lonely Island. 

Rather, when determining whether or not an extraordinary claim is true, what is more important is to ask this: 
How likely would the evidence be realized/reported, if the event had NOT occurred? 

Back to our example: How likely is it that the Evening News would announce a particular sequence of lottery numbers, if that WASN'T the actual winning sequence? 
If it is unlikely that the Evening News would do this, then we can have good reason to believe that the particular sequence of lottery numbers reported is indeed true, WITHOUT such a need for any extraordinary evidence. We don't even require a video recording, we just take the Evening News' word for it, going on the reliability of their testimony."
a good talk!
Would the dips in light intensity from a particular star be affected by everything between it and the earth telescope?  There wouldn't be a repetitive 2 year gap between dips but it could be why the 2013 readings were so different?
"that's astronomy, showing the immense possibilities of universe and happy to see the curious citizen scientists taking active participation, guessing no other science does this .. I may be wrong but yeah heard only this field allows curiosity to take over you just by observing the patterns"
"Verbal diarrhea, this is stupid! You can see how this captures your imagination! Kepler was a fraud, astronomy today is bull, specially when you have useful idiots running the scam. Boring talk and she didn't provide anything insightful or useful!"
When people go off on long lines of conjecture it usually means they are trying to bullshit you.
"Well the star is 1480 light years away, so what ever is happening happened a looooooong time ago. 
Still very exciting to see what the explanation will be."
The data were good
"In this talk, space explorer Boyajian gives us a riveting tale of an extraordinary finding from a distant star. Taking a cue from this info, the amateur explorers will search for the truth about the aliens in this direction.  This is something staggering and unheard of. Highly recommended for those who are interested in finding aliens, exoplanets and strange celestial phenomena."
The dips could be caused by anything in between the Earth and that star; not necessarily by something orbiting that star.
this could be because sudden changes on the medium of travel due toh space dust and difference in density!
"If we can see the supposed alien structure, that means they've seen us long time ago"
ia it possible that something got in. the way of the telescope
"Yeah, let's just hope that it's an alien civilization that is capable of destroying a planet.  Yeah, that sounds just peachy!"
"What is the likelihood that a blackhole is orbiting a star? At an angle. Maybe bouncing from star to star, thus giving the smooth transition, then sharp redirect of movement. What I find unusual, is that stars are stationary. If they are affected by gravity like everything else, shouldn't they be moving too?"
This is the first place we should point the JWST.
"I'm _not saying_ it was aliens, but...... *It was aliens.*"
Aliens or Mutants or Monsters or Mexicans from Space or X men or Krypton or xjairhdjz....or Ultrons...or Green lanterns
I believe the massive object is a millenium falcon lol
"Replace every instance she says ""science"" and replace it immediately with ""God""... It changes nothing"
It was Another Flat Earth!
"Giant planet shaped solar panels...
Running out of resources, better make nontransferable resources by building a structure larger than any naturally forming planet that would require every other resource that our planet doesn't have. How retarded are some of these theorists? That is literally the most incomprehensibly stupid thing i've ever heard."
"This talk went off the rails pretty fast into rampart speculation. I kept wondering what she actually wanted us to do or believe.
Clearly without a means to get more data these blips on the chart will always remain unsolvable riddles.  I like the fact that humans are better than computers in seeing patterns but other than that I'm left to wonder why she made this talk."
without sun we nothingness.
"regardless of aliens or not I think the best takeaway here is citizen science. Citizen science isn't restricted by religion, politics, or whatever. It would also be much more difficult to control or filter a thousand backyard scientists rather than just a few recognized scientific establishments. The possibilities could be endless as technology brings more ability to the citizen scientist."
"Maybe it's a solar system with a lot of planets, like a 100 jupiters"
Excuse what about taking more care about arabic language
I am not saying aliens but... aliens.
How do they distinguish sun spots from planets?
Reapers?
Why does this not have more views!?
An asymmetrical drop in star light can be caused by a cluster of asteroids/moons and also can be caused by a highly elliptical orbit.
"What if it's something that only looks bigger because it's closer to Earth, like a bunch of debris passing through the space between star systems?"
"wow, the end of the energy? the energy never ends, just transform..."
mind is very blown rn.....
"Okay... let me get this straight. You have a star 1480 light years way, which at seemingly random times one or more objects passed between it and the Kepler space telescope we were observing it with, and the only options you are putting out there, don't include any that could simply NOT be part of its (potential) solar system, or passing nearby the star.... There's 1480 light years of space for something to get in the way, and these are the only ideas anybody has...?!? She mentioned that a planet the size of Jupiter would have a dimming effect of about 1%, but i'm pretty sure that if Jupiter actually got in the way, it would have a dimming effect of probably 100%, because it's closer. With such a narrow perspective of each star and no ability to see the objects making the change in brightness, why would the assumption be (when the dimming is irregular) that it isn't just an unknown set of independent smaller objects that happen to be closer than the expected distances of orbiting planets. Also, if these objects aren't moving in circles around the star, but were heading away or towards the star, that could account for the increased duration. The quote at the beginning was also odd, since it really did sound like a claim was being made, but no evidence (that might validate that claim) was ever presented. And if you want to go down that route, then i want to put forward the counter-claim that this is exactly the dimming effect i would expect to see from a cosmic teapot."
"One word. StarKiller Base.  Well, two words,actually.. Technically.😔"
I dont think it's a  kind of giant solar panel because anything with this  large size which is even much greater than gupiter should be in spherical shape in order to circulate around star(same reason that earth is not flat) and suppose this happens than tell me how did that hypothetical alien civilization get this much resources to make a structure greater than their own planet (if that planet actually exists than it must affect the data) moreover how did they get the uniform material in this much quantity to make that panel. silicone is very abundant on earth but still it is not enough to make even a tiny proportion of this big solar panel.
The truth is out there.
"I am ready to join and stay all days and nights searching for any unusual activitys outside the universe. and to discover a new world or eliens , it will change our intier life.
and in my opinion it will be a great discovery for us to work and prepare for what next."
"I got in trouble watching this in class, but then I showed my teacher and since it was science class, she let us watch it on the projector. #lucky"

"We survived Y2K, ordinary citizens are carrying around powerful and versatile computers in their pocket, Colin Furze has built a hoverbike, and crazy sci-fi concepts are being thrown around in scientific circles as very real possibilities.

We are officially living in the future.  :D"
Looking forward to the boring actual explanation to the phenomenon :D
maybe starkiller base was in front of the stat
This is actually terrifying. I hope there's a perfectly natural explanation for it.
haha this woman is crazy
Could it be a large cloud of gas and dust traveling between us and the star at a fairy high speed?
"Alien stargods for sure.
And once we tell them about ourselves they will want more pets to play with =)"
"Planet is far from star. planet wobles. planet has rings.

where is my nobel prize?"
"Now, why is Kepler pursuing other projects? It should've stayed there for at least 4 more years to observe this."
goosebumps detected! :)
I'm going to start saying where's the flux.
SUITABLE FOR Harry Potter
Just like Star Wars the force awakens
"The first half of this talk was really good and enticing, but she focuses too much on her friend's presumptions. It makes the talk a bit kitsch, unfortunately."
what if the star is rotating side by side against a black hole... and this black hole is sucking the star energi... and this low light pics is when the black hole is clouse to the star?
I want to believe.
9 people didn't like this video. I wonder why...
Finally something that is not about black people discrimnation / women's rights or vegans. THANK YOU!
Part of the beauty is the correlation with just how little we actually know.
Yo momma is so fat she messed up the Kepler data
What about a planet blocking a star from a different Galaxy that just happened to be in one line in our vision
Dude.. Seriously NOONE thought of binary stars
"IF, aliens are smart enough to do the technologies suggested, I would also think they are smart enough to know that this weird pattern of light, is a way to get the attention of other life around the galaxy. Maybe the question should be, what is the most effective way, to communicate across the galaxy, that there is other life?"
"""that's no moon"""
i just wasted 13minutes of  my life in a pointless Talk >_<
"If we do find more unlikely phenomena like this it will get harder and harder to explain away the alien hypothesis.
Since this the the likely way a civilization will progress."
As always its the media that makes this unknown star into evidence of aliens.  This has nothing to do with science and everything to do with sensationalism.  Sadly with sciences like astronomy and physics so under funded the actual scientist hesitate to point out how extremely unlikely the media's conclusion are.
Great presentation. Thank you.
This is Soo exciting!
SO THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE A DYSON SPHERE THOUSANDS OF LIGHT YEARS AWAY.. WHICH MEANS... IN REAL TIME THEY ARE VERY ADVANCED.. A THOUSAND YEARS ADVANCED THAN MAKING A DYSON SPHERE.. OMG!!
the darkness must not be breached
start farts maybe
Her hypothesis is premature when saying alien can not defy our law of physics. how does she know that? She just guess and making a theory from the data that she saw. just like the mid eastern people there's a god  when they can not explain something beyond their ideas.
My dream is to see a TED talk about the first time non-scientists looked at any kind of data from space without seeing any aliens in it. Please let it happen at least once within my lifetime.
"If ""aliens"" could make a structure around a sun i think we would probably already know about them think how big that would be and the materials and stuff needed to make it. I think there would be  10's or 100's of billions of the intelligent aliens and they would of explored a lot of the universe and mine planets to make it. How far away is this star BTW?"
"I sense that she's unsure when she says she thinks it's natural. Like she really wants to say that she doesn't think it is, but she feels pressured to stick with the typical 'reason/logic' safety net because that's what scientists are expected to do."
"a commercial for Independence Day 2? ;-)

the movie will explain it all!"
When will we have sharper vision?
The universe is the most amazing thing in the world. Oh wait.... That didn't make any sense =/
"Out with religion. In with the aliens! Lol but seriously this is fucking pathetic. When you can't explain something, just be honest with yourself damnit."
"Why is everyone assuming she thinks aliens did this? She said ""Personally, as a scientist, my money is on the natural explanation."" She is not advocating aliens as an explanation, guys. She was just trying to disprove various notions, including aliens."
I bet it was bill gates making love to the star.
This was really fun to watch
Finally a woman that isn't bitching about her vagina. It's become a bit of a rarity at TED to have an intelligent woman on.
"I sent mail to those aliens, waiting for them to reply, we will get the answer soon."
Morty is messing around that star.
CC.... ESPAÑOL
ESPAÑOL.. SPANISH...ESPAGNOL...
considero de mal gusto el que no tengan traduccion o en subtitulos en ESPAÑOL!!!...... ha visto subtitulos hasta en serbio!!!..... latinoamerica tambien tiene derecho a conocer tan interesantes temas...
aliens are blind
wtf
She's not saying Aliens but... Aliens.
"It could be a blackhole, its huge and it does not produces any light"
Aliens
"Could it be a set of objects (one for each of the given data spikes) that just happen to pass between Kepler and KIC much closer to us than to the star ? That would explain the apparent vastness, the lack of dust or heat sources, while remaining nearly as improbable as actual alien megastructures."
"Why would a multitude of Dyson Spheres be so inefficient that in 95% of the time, they would capture and use 0% of the sun's energy and then suddenly ""kick in"" and harvest 15%?
Such a sporadic event can't be based on energy needs, why would you build a gigantic megastructure, if it only would be used once every few years?
If its not natural, its probably a machine thats made for special events, not pure energy management as we imagine the purpose of a Dyson Sphere. To be completely honest, the Death-Star explanation, a weapon which quickly charges up and then returns to inactivity is a pretty logical but scary conclusion."
"Total garbage.
Not science!"
8:47 FAIL
Aliens.
"बहुत बडी अंतरिक्षीय वेल मछली होगी जो कि तारे को ढक रही होगी । #डाॅक्टर_हू

It must be a giant space whale that's causing the star black out. #DoctorWho"
"Well hello Ousters, we found their orbital forest rings!"
Truly amazing
Could be the blight eating a galaxy spanning hive mind like popcorn.
if that is the only data point this project has (the light% curve) then the odd curve in light can be explaned by moons on that planet and  maybe more then one planet in that solar system.
If there is an alien civilization we should already have noticed it. Fermi paradox...
"So this is ""Tabby"" of ""Tabby's Star"". Excellent...."
FINALLY. Something actually rooted in science
WTF the whole presentation turned AYY LMAO
A Dyson sphere in the making?
"I really appreciate that this star was found by amateurs.
This is the sort of thing that I'd kinda like to hear a follow up on, but never expect to."
It's funny how we humans imagine aliens harvesting energy from a star - by building huuuge solar panels. I can imagine the alien scientists watching us and having a good laugh :) An advanced civilization may have found a much more efficient way to do that.
interesting!
"Deep down, I do hope it is aliens, but I suspect those highly advanced megastructures are probably impossible to build."

Scary!!
Nice story.
"Could be massive comets , they are not always circular"

To get brighter of course."
wowwwwwwwwww
