This was a great watch.
"Just a question how to we Insert Host Rna do we use Cas9 protein ?  


Also Second question how do add  host rna to DNA in the first place rna has ribose while DNA has Deoxyribose also rna has Uracil as its nitrogenous base instead of Thymine ?"
Thank you good sir.. this really helped me for my presentation
"Filling the gap
No evidence showed regarding any allegation
Stop misleading people"
I watched half a dozen videos so far on CRISPR and this video helped me piece everything together with enough details. Thank you very much
AWESOME VIDEOOOOOOO!!!! LOVED IT
I guess it could be used for bad ( weapons) and good ( healing).

I hate science
Love  this video! Very handsome
They transformed it into a weaponized version eugenics and specifically to create altered versions of plagues in undesirable populations. Hope they don‚Äôt use it.
ËÆö
god I love you
Great video!‚ù§
Wow
üòÖüòÖ
I always come back to this video when I need a refresher on CRISPR. This video has it all. Thank you!
Thank you for the discussion.
Your videos have helped me in every major step in my academic career. I am a 1st year medical student and still come back to your videos for help. Thank you so much for all that you do!
Can someone tell me how this is done though? Like is a machine used?
Not very clear.
CRISPER IS A LIVING BEING
Blestematilor .. focul lui Putin o sa va arda .nimic nu o sa ramana din dracoveniile voastre spurcate ..
Thank you
"8 years later your videos continue saving lives and degrees. Incredible explanations! Please, for the love of god and the hope of future generations, never take down your posts!!"
"Great explanation, highly appreciated <3"
"Good job but i think have a mistake 

In any given bacterial strain, a CRISPR sequence inserted during the oldest infection is located farthest from the cas genes and the most recent is closest to the cas genes."
Thanks a lot after 8 years wow=)
Basically what it is is x men technology there is a price that comes with playing God. A half life
Cambridge AS and A level biology writers should come and have lecture from you and then rewrite the book
very good explanation! thank you sir.
THANK YOU SO MUCH !!!! loved every second of this
brilliant simple explanation
Am I allowed to invite you to my college graduation?
Have you guys heard about mitochondria ? Hint- its the Powerhouse of the cell
Genetics is insane‚Ä¶ dystopian future incoming
thank you that was very helpful!!!
CRISPR has made its way to the general public in the form of a Sickle Cell treatment. Limited trials i believe.
Stumbled across it during my breakfast and such a wonderful video it is. The concept is explained very lucidily.
How come it's RNA binding to DNA ... Shouldn't it be DNA too to bind to bacteriophage DNA
"GRACIAS, ni un solo video con el que pudiese entenderlo y ahora me ha quedado clar√≠simo ü´∂üèª"
super helpful!!
it was helpful:)
"How would you target all of the cells?
Otherwise the gene we want to be silenced would only be removed from the cells we have targeted."
"I'm not sure I'm 100% on exactly how it works, but you did a beautiful job of explaining the base concepts to a relatively unscientific shlub like me. Thanks!"
This will inevitably lead to people getting cancer from using this via gene mutations. As if the radiation from CT scanners and adjuvants from the shots are not enough. Just more customers for the allopathic medicine industry
"Ahh,, ya. 
I totally get it now.
Thanks for the simple explanation.
So much clearer on that now."
"My teacher adviced my entire class to watch this video for a better understanding, and now I can see why. You just saved my essay man, thank you!"
Í∞êÏÇ¨Ìï©ÎãàÎã§!!
Amazing ü§©
Soooo helpful thank you!
"As a biology student, this helped me so much. Amazing video!"
Hey I have a question (I hope you are still reading and replying to comments) - how do you  cure a disease whose gene is in every cell of the body? How do you replace and insert a new gene replacing the old one which was causing the disease in ALL the cells in the body
"Many have played Jenga or know the basics of displacement.
Before humans have a complete understanding of genetics and a true explanation for "" junk DNA"".
In my opinion, sciences ( generic) are run like a business and may theories are lacking in research, application and the red tape is snipped prematurely to hasten a contract or deal . Scary shit."
"this was honestly very beautiful , ill need to rewatch it tho"
Great lecture and simplicity  explained üëå üéâüéâüòä thanks
"I typically never leave comments on videos, but you really taught me an entire lecture and lecture video  that my teracher assigned. She's not a bad teacher i actually like her, but somehow not everything gets through. I was so shaky on the concept or the crispr system and didn't know what was what. Now i feel as though i have some illegal knowledge that the government will try to take me in for at some point in my life."
Thanks!
loved it

"As a first year med student, THANK YOU!"
"I have grade 10 biology education (though fairly smart). I've taken an interest in this thing and genetic modifications in general. This was very easy to follow. Can anyone recommend a more advanced thing though that goes over WHY it's cutting those genes (all the details - chemicals etc.), and more in detail about adding the new DNA?"
"Helix superbug cure  /  use crisp cut the superbug into short chain with manageable size and do the short chain bug with drugs known to us ,   mioa"

In a Bioformatics program internship. My instructor took hours
CRISPR has the potential for life extension.
They've created an artificial ribosomal sub unitüòÆ
THANK YOU FOR THIS. MY PROFESSOR TRIED EXPLAINING THIS IN 1.5 HRS BUT ITS ONLINE SO IT MAKES IT EVEN MORE ENTICING TO SLEEP. 1.5 HRS SAVED
You're a rockstar
"I really liked your video, I am an educator - teaching medical residents and students. Can you please share how you create animations for your videos. Thanks in advance. Dr Arora"
Thanks for sharing this! it was awesome ;)
"Thanks Mr Bozeman. Great explanation! I do have a question. If you want to heal a patient with a genetic disease, does the crispr-cas9 corrects one cell or all the cells? If it only heal one cell, how does the healed cell overcome other original cells?"
that was fantastic to summarize it in a very short time. thanks
I watched 5 videos but still i was confused until i found your video and I understood everything finally üíñüíñüíñüíñüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªüëèüèªthank you
Is it host DNA or RNA that is incorporated when inserting a gene? I believe both were said
"Well, this is really helpful. Thank you so much. ‚ù§Ô∏è"
love it
I would like permission to use this video in a presentation for our church livestream (on YouTube and our website).  How do I go about doing that?
Blows my mind
loove u
awesome explanation!
found my new favourite channel
"Thanks for that exciting video, it was extremely informational. I am interested what is advantages of trcrRNA-crRNA chimera?"
This was really helpful!
AMAZING explanation!! Thank you!
"there's one quastion ib my mind. If we use SCISPR-CAS  in human body, will our immune system react to foreign protein CAS9?"
Very helpful !
that helpful. thanks for sharing.
Hmmmm... maybe this fancy CRISPR thinguhmajigger can help me grow my hair back
thank you so much
"Best sir love from Pakistan üáµüá∞.

"thank , informative video"
thank you! finally got it
thank you it is a life saver. I have an exam tomorrow
Is it really possible to reprogram dna in adults or is it only possible in embryo?
"No no no, if you think it'll only be used fir good your so wrong. Greed money and power . This is horrific"
Perfect!
"""Shut up and give me wolf ears!"""
Could this help ALS?
"I wonder for the modified CRISPR, when do the cutting of the original double stranded DNA, where did the original gene sequence go? Because it seem like the enzyme only cleave the DNA at specific location and not remove the desired gene that we want to replace"
https://youtu.be/o6lFCb7Yhsg
"Preparing for my med-sku interview tomorrow, I hope they'll ask me something about this so I could show off as a 17 year old. Lord bless me."
that is amazing yet terrifying. Genetically Modified Humans! Could someone inject me with a virus¬†and have the crisper process started without my knowledge?
That was very Interesting Thanks Paul Never thought i would have Understood or watched it till the end Thanks.
"You did a great job with this video, so much so that a layperson could grasp it. Thank you. Please do one on Oligodendroglioma brain tumors!"
4:55 5:13
Is the third part just an engineered linear strand? Or is that a plasmid? So do scientists put in both CRSPR and a linear DNA to gene edit a cell?
I'm not an English speaker and I understood this video. Thank you very much for the explanation. It's very visual and that had helped me a lot. For more teachers like this guy :)
"Crisper will introduce something we don't want.   Sorry.   The introduction of what we have been seeing over the last 2 years is an attempt to control society on a grand scale. The individuals that are supposedly controlling everything that happens have a plan to regulate everything.  Mostly, how we function daily. Period.  
How?
Well, something has been introduced into us that we ran to recently because of a scare.  Ask yourself what was it?  Well, it shut down everything under the guise of health emergency people.  Why did they do this?  To control:
Population.
Banking
Health
Policing.  and even worship.
It will even recognize YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!! 
Remember the Tom Cruise movie?  Minority Report?  
China has already pushed forward with the credit system that recognizes you at a drop of a hat!
DNA manipulation will be introduced into the human body from the next level of digital I.D.  this I.D. will recognize you!!!!
Anytime ""THEY"" want!!
CRISPR.
Yea.
Good Idea! 
Read your bible!!!"
Thank you so much! That was super helpful!!!!
Can you invest in a company working on this?
"Great, you have an amazing faculty to diseminate science. Congratulations"
The road to hell is paved with good intentions
"Crispr this bitch 
(And I say b**** because I really actually admire how individuals can call each other b**** especially females and just be completely chill and cool about it and I have no ego or no desire to be better than one another or be hurt and this term of endearment becomes what sounds of the mouth have already meant to be and what intellects claim to be the persistent persute  of human  expression within the language should not suppress dynamic form of

"I never write commentaries here on YT, but this time I need to do it to thank for this, I never understood de CRISP-Cas9 system till now!!! I'M SO HAPPY!!!
I know it's kind of ridiculous, but feels great to understand something you couldn't before. Now I can really read the paper and actually understand.

THANK YOU
THANK YOU
THANK YOU"
"You are so right about the level of videos in molecular biology. They either target primary school level, or PhD level. I don't see any molecular biology videos explaining staff for high school or BSc level"
Kinda like a epigentic spacer
Do you still answer your comments?
totally helpful
Does tracrRNA have any function other than to hold stuff in place?
"I went over the CRISPR system today with my students, had them model it with the Bio-Rad paper model, now I'm going to make an Ed-Puzzle using this video as formative before we actually do a CRISPR experiment in class (lacZ gene knockout). Thank you for this in depth video on CRISPR!"
Why am I paying for university
Medical student here. Nicely done Mr. Anderson!
I still don‚Äôt understand it
"Loved this explanation, thank you!"
Awesome video! Thanks for making it.
GOOD!!
What part of it changes you do you not understand
Now i could understand! Thank you <3
Tried explaining this in my podcast where I go over CRISPR technology but you explained this perfectly thank you!
Nice Many Thanks
Thank you
Cool video! Thanks :)
super helpful
6:27 can someone explain in more detail how the DNA is added?
How do u manage to insert a new fragment after the cutting? Is there a particular DNA ligase associated with the CAS complex?
Can we just be humane humans...üò®üò®üò®
speaker talks a little too fast
"Very well explained, I had trouble understanding this topic during lecture. Thx"
nice
And the recap at the end. Thanks so much! Very helpful
4 words - YOU ARE THE BEST	111
Mind-blowing simple demonstration of the crispr cas.... üî•üî•üî•
very helpful! took me a long time to understand what's spacer DNA and what are repeats from only reading.. watching the video really summarized it all. not so simple and not so complicated. just what you really want to know
This is perfect.  THANK YOU!
"The mad scientist really opened Pandor's Box with this one.  Rewriting millions of years of evolution cannot  be good.  This technology should have been top secret.  These individuals were more interested in fame and furtune then the impact it will have on the world üåé   China is now utilizing this technology.  They recently built concentrations camps, could be bio-laboratories.  Humans are not yet wise enough to wield such power.  We're not going to make it, too many wrong turns."
Awsome Video! Thanks for the effort! Much appreicated and so helpful!
how can I grow taller or cure hair loss from this? I ready to take the risks.
"Wow soo this is CRISPR...
Makes sense to make a fuss for it cause it really has a potential. 
But if it starts being used to make modified humans like super soliders... woooah it could be devastating"
Whats this tech used for now?
"CRISPR, another failed miracle cure."
Thank you that was very clarifying!
Thank you Steve Kerr
What a great explanation....excellent lectureüî•üî•
"use it on clostridium difficilewhich really sucks to come down with, that might eliminate fecal trans plants."
Great video!
"As far as I know the CRISPR virus causes a fever which has killed a lot of people and is the major risk factor. Immunotherapy has that risk but I hope they are really working to counter that as it a good way to remove genetic diseases from the dna of cells or repair cancerous cells and will be a good tool to help people survive. Until a machine can exist that can program dna externally and destroy cells which is far away, using some kind of qauntum non destructive computer controlled radiation streams."
I love your videos!! you should do reviews for MCAT material!
"I watched this for my school activity and I have to rewatch it over and over to understand since I'm very slow. But it is TOTALLY HELPFUL, with all the illustrations and the explanations. Thank you!"
great explanation! I finally understood what CRISPR really is. Now I'm ready to learn more!
What a simple and clear explanation! Thank you very much!
crRna is like a sea otter chipping its prey in two with a stone it holds in its tiny hands whilst floating on its back in the sea
Verry helpful and a welcome addition to the shows seen on PBS.
this was the most amazing explanation. I completely understand now
ÊàëÂ•ΩÂÉèÊáÇ‰∫Ü

"Hi sir, please make a video on PAM"
I wonder if celebs and the ultra wealthy are already using this technology to create designer babies
I've seen the real thing done in a lab.  Anyone with 5 minutes of training can do it.  It's in silica.  So if you like to spin cells add a caustic element run a PCR amplification and then in silica show the procedure done go for it.  But it amounts to nothing.  It's literally imaginary.  Go ahead and be amazed by explanations and animations but watch it done in the lab.  And tell me you believe it after that.  It's nothing.
Dude. You look tired. I ªd be too if I was teaching the whole freaking world.
I though CRISPR was the technology that makes illigal Aliens US Citizens without all the Bureaucratic Red Tape??
"In response to ""was it helpful?"", well I'm using this video to prepare my A levels biology lecture."
"This is how the Human race will destroy itself. My generation thought it would be physics. Now we know it will be molecular biology. We have seen the face of evil.  Unfortunately, the fools writing comments will be in control of regulating this monster. As you can see, they are utterly clueless."
interesting
You people are sick assholes you make it sound so great but show the downside
amazingly simplified and comprehensible!
You nailed it <3 wow. Thank you. Now I know my ABC :D
yes it was helpful:)
"Excellent video, Bravo"
doing a biology lab rn and all i can think of is how the dna looks like noodles :)
absolutely amazing explanation!
really helpful üëç
MONSTER
wow. You were right. Most of the other videos were too simple. This was perfectly explained
"I have been reading and reading about this but I have a question that I simply cannot find the answer to: When editing a developed organism, what is the vehicle for SPREADING this change throughout?  Every lecture and article tells me what happens in a single cell, but how does this change then spread? Do we just need to inject a large amount of the gRNA and Cas9 at once? Or is there a way to make a small change spread to other cells, like a virus.  If anyone knows, please answer.  I'm a sci-fi writer and I'm trying to get to the bottom of this to accurately represent a hypothetical situation in my plot."
"wow!!! I sure need to review the normal DNA before understanding this!!! Very complex!
Sounds very interesting"
"Wow crazy how this video was made 5 years ago, this years going to see a lot of CRISPR trials starting, finally get to see how effective this tech is going to be"
"It's the ""amalgamation"""
"Could CRISPR be what they used to ""create"" covid 19 in a lab?"
"Esto no es una verdadera emergencia sanitaria, es una dictadura mundial. Esta es la Tercera Guerra Mundial... pero a√∫n no se ha declarado abiertamente. Los que no est√°n despiertos tienen pocas posibilidades de sobrevivir.

Quienes dominan este mundo quieren tratarnos como terminales de computadora, quieren instalarnos un software y dejar que un algoritmo decida por nosotros. Es el fin de la era humana, o eso creen quienes nos dominan, porque ellos quieren que seamos transhumanos... Y sin derecho a elegir lo que se hace con nuestros propios cuerpos.

Las vacunas modifican el ADN, eso est√° fuera de discusi√≥n. Un cuerpo humano normal no puede producir la prote√≠na espiga... El ARN mensajero es lo que le ense√±a a nuestro cuerpo a producir esta prote√≠na sint√©tica. El ADN natural no modificado no se puede patentar, porque es un producto de la naturaleza, pero si aceptaste esta vacuna, entonces tu ADN ya est√° modificado y ya est√°s patentado. 

Eres transhumano. Los transhumanos perder√°n todos sus derechos, porque ya no ser√°n considerados humanos. Los derechos humanos no los proteger√°n. Antes de que te enfades con quien te dice la verdad, investiga... Y si ya est√°s despierto, entonces te felicito. De cualquier manera, Dios los bendiga a todos, de todos modos. Les deseo lo mejor."
Very helpful thank you!
god this video is so good thank u sir!!!!!!!!!!!
going to study this in 2022 wish me luck bois
I think this is a very good video to understand the CRISPR CAS 9 system
Is crisper something you inject into the body?
"So eventually there going to build them there own real human or something. It's not bad, it's ribow flaven"
Crispr Chimera yeah human and animal DNA splicing that's exactly what they're doing of course the public won't hear about what they're doing until it's too late
Great video! But how can you make sure your gene of interest gets in the correct place if the cas protein cuts with blunt ends?
"What will happen or is happening as we speak worldwide when some MADMAN SCIENTISTS decide to use this against us, as they obviously did???? 
Science is good but only in the hands of a morally god person!!!! It‚Äôs not so good in the hands of a psychopath who is using it to develop a so called ‚Äúmedicine‚Äù or as we are all witnesses now a VA@C!N‚Ç¨ that‚Äôs full of mRNA that we don‚Äôt know what was it ACTUALLY designed to do to us???? 
SHOULD WE BE SO STUPID TO BELIEVE SOME MAD SCIENTISTS? 
THEY ARE MORE OFTEN THEN NOT DEVELOPING SOMETHING THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE DONE!!! 
IT IS BEING REVILED SLOWLY WHAT DR. FAUCI & HIS EVIL FRIENDS DID AT WOHAN‚Ä¶. The truth is slowly emerging in the meantime millions injected with mRNA va@c!n‚Ç¨s will be getting sicker & dying from those üíâüíâüíâüíâ"
"Now when this mortal puts on immortality and this corruptible puts on The incorruptible then comes the end

Crisper is Satan
This is such a great video that really helped get an understanding of what CRISPR is as my text book brought in terms that weren't defined. Excellent video so happy with this.
can somebody explain how the system adds the host RNA in the DNA ?
Thankyou. Please keep making videos I don't care if there are videos present of certain topic because the way I explain in small amount of time. It's the best.
Covid vaccine
Actually dr. This is what the new Hitler will use undoubtedly to wipe out masses
if only this was main stream media
"Then, 3 years later.."
"Great job explaining this, I nearly lost my mind understanding it!"
best video
Still do not understand. How do you cut? How do you see what to cut?
that was really helpful thank you so mutch!
What nice video! Saved me from hours of reading! Many thanks for the effort!
Great video!
Your recitation is unclear.
Marvelously well done!
Isn't it possible the presence of CRISPR spacer sequence multiple times in a genome as the sequence is very short as compared to genome sizes of species? What if CRISPR cuts DNA at multiple locations?
Incredibly helpful! Thank you!
Very helpful video. Thank you
I'll be test dummy for this
"I've just finished reading Jennifer Doudna's book and it is very good- passed it over to my GP; this is an excellent follow up , so well done."
THANK YOU !!! I've done alot of research and i couldn't fully understand it till now ! Big thanks !
"This video was great, thank you!"
"Yeah, Intermediate Bio final coming up and have already been tested on this. Sufficient to say that in the seven minutes it took for you to explain this, I realized how many hours I wasted of my life that i'll never get back trying to understand it. Thank you for your simple and elegant description of CRISPR CAS9"
"Oh, I love this. Thank you so much. My text book was making my eyes glaze over. And like you say, the other videos I found were too short or super intense."
"THIS IS AMAZING SCIENCE THAT CAN HELP MANY PEOPLE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS GETTING TO THE HANDS OF SOME VERY EVIL AND GREEDY PEOPLE THAT WANT DEHUMANIZE  AND CONTROL OUR MINDS, OUR THOUGHTS, OUR BEHAVIOR.  I DO NOT WANT ANY PART OF IT, I PREFER TO STAY THE WAY GOD MADE ME."
Wonderfull explanation. Thank you

very beautifully explained video. Thank u very much for a very informative video
So this is where the religious Agenda got the whole psychotic break about RNA. Great video man!
Thank you so much . I easily understood the mechanism of Crispr-Cas 9 after watching this video!
what is the function of the repeated segments?
Some stuff you said was too complex or simple.
"Look at the graphene structure, 6 points, 6 lines, and many of these sixes. Or one can say it has 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons. This is the the mark of the beast 666. Also what can cause pain (Revelation 16:10) and a noisome and grievous sore (Revelation 16:2)? Only something medicinal can cause these. Not a chip implant.

Human body is 18 percent carbon. So therefore the number of a man is also 666 as 6+6+6=18.‚Ä¶ _Revelation 13:18"
man. i love you.
Crispr technology graphene oxide and how Hydra vulgaris all working hand-in-hand and each and every one of the vaccines for covid-19

"One thing I don't understand is how he injects himself with 'crispr' to modify his genes in attempt to create enhanced muscle growth. However, on his website he 'plugs' , so called ""odin""; he doesn't sell, nor does he talk about, such therapy on his website odin... will someone please elaborate?"
"Brilliant video thank you, I am definitely using your video as aback link, it needs to be seen by more people"

Absolutely awesome so well explained thanks ! From a French Biotechnology master's degree student
Looks like the bug they found in the jab vile this week.
Great! Just some feedback: Please speak a little slower. I put the speed at 0.75 as it went a touch fast. Maybe just me. The overall explanation was very helpful. Thank you for sharing!
Is the covid vaccine crispr research?
Can the Crispr method help in fighting viruses like Covid and Malaria?
Thank you! It was really helpful and engaging!
"yeah sure, that was helpful!"
Now explain the mRNA vaccine.
"You observed that the CRISPR knock-out of protein X either promotes or represses RNA polymerase II transcription, depending on the gene. Which experiments would you carry out to reveal the mechanism for this differential activity?"
Yea you are not God. Stop this.
I found this useful .Thank you
"Sick minded people.They're sickening us with the COVID Jabs to ""treat"" the elite later with DNA interference.I thought after banning cloning we'd never live a nightmare again."
"Nice instructional video. I would not have been able to follow you but for my background in developing PCR equipment in the 90s   Maybe edit it and include something about the DNA structure  you know phosphates  and sugars and Base Pairs made up of  AGCT and  of course U for RNA. 
Given all the wild  and sometimes seemingly insane garbage flooding the web arising as  knee-jerk reactions  to the inept and  clumsy  messaging from  our  national medical establishment  People really  do need things explained to them and no one is doing it."
"Yes it is helpful for me 
It is simplest explanation of CRISPR"
This was excactly what i was looking for! Thank you

Yes you created it you created everything by using patient's blood . The downfall it has never been tested only humans in this order you don't knowledge the long term effects it's an on  going experiment study symptoms in humans as the years go by . How bout all the problems it caused animals ?  they became very ill and you haven't euthanized . Not to mention the babies in China .
And it can be deadly to humans if something goes wrong .
Very helpful.
"Best CRISPR video, thank you so much!"
Wow. Dangerous but very helpful to ppl who need it. Just don‚Äôt let the military have it lol
"Crispr is satans technology, it will only harm humanity"
Holy shit
Giving it a goofy name like crisper makes it difficult to take seriously.
Simple and nicely explained... easy to understand
Covid have left the chat..
It was helpfull indeed. Thank you very much... great job.
CRUD Operation  DNA
I'm a Science teacher and we watch your videos all the time. They're a great combo of info and visuals- thanks!
Great video.
This is fantastic thank you!
Only saddens me that I was born 50 years ago. What a grand time people will have in a hundred years.
"I feel like YouTube is a perfect example of how our education system is failing. I couldn't retain shit bc I was always so stressed, literally every science YouTube video has stuck like glue and I know more about chemistry and biology from YouTube than I ever learned in any AP class. What's that say? Maybe stress inhibits certain types of learning and I'm never stressed when I'm on YouTube lmaoo, and even in college courses you're not nearly as stressed as you are in highschool. Crazy"
still too complicated for me.
"I watched this video around six times, it helped me so much with my seminar paper"
"Fluent, enjoyable visuals--in other words, great TV and computer stuff.  Without a previous, hard-earned background in genetics, chemistry, etc. one ""understands"" CRISPR from this only in the most shallow, non-retainable way.  A good effort at explaining a terrifying technology but an effort undercut by its medium."
Excellent exposition
My gratitude to Dr Osaoji on YouTube who helped my eliminate herpes virus within 21days of using his medication

Have a hard time believing Virus are real... same with germ theory... Did they land on the moon? There is no solid moon... Can you kill germs/viruses...? Are they even real! The education systems have proven them selves to be too dam stupid... Academia is a joke and they sound like idiots and even arrogant about it.
"Yes helpful, but very scary."
"Hope  this technique help DMD children  very soon 
Thanks"
"Great video, never fully understood CRISPR until this vid, thanks for making it!"
Perfect intermediate-level explanation!!! Thanks so much :) Studying for my cancer pharmacology final exam and we did a special topics lecture on CRISPR Cas9 in cancer therapy
Loved this video!
Wow! That was super helpful. Thanks a milion
Cure HIV ......
Such a good video! This helped me a lot in my CRISPR unit of CHEM 482
I bet this technology is what is really being used in the covid vaccine.
Thank you so much
Too simple brah. Please explain how PAM sequences work. That is a critical part.
Can you do treatment for autism?
sir i adore you thank you so much
This is  what I have puzzled over - trying to understand CRSPR and getting further and further in the weeds. You accomplished breaking something so brilliant  down to where an  ordinary mortal can begin to understand   - which takes another special type of brilliance.  Thank you for recognizing the need.   You made my day
great explanation !! thank you !
Thank you king
Well then are the short  repeats segments what they call in genetic genaology the same as SNPs? Just curious...
For CCP flu vaccine...
You're the best!!
"Amazing video, perfectly and simply explained"
I like that video is really beneficial for everyone. Thanks
You have not explained how the CAS9 knows where to cut the dna.
I bacteria genetics are not contained in a nucleus how do they have memory??
"Regarding the 2m48s mark on CAS1, it seems if the cell can detect the invader  (i.e. no previous dna history), and still neutralize it, why does it need to save a dna (vaccination-card) record of it?   

I get the cas9 is just the scissors, and must be combined with the ""chimera"" guide gRNA.   But if the gRNA is composed of the CRISPR crRNA (the spacer segment to match)  +  the tracrRNA is what *HOLDS* the crRNA in place..  What moves this RNA complex to the desired spot?  And what is the bacteria's version of the ""chimera"" tracrRNA?  


And if you have a single-gene disorder, ex. Huntington's, and assuming you draw White-Blood-Cells, inject with a plasmid of CC5/CAS9, and incubate until you grow enough modified cells under the hood, how is this CAS9/CRISPR complex delivered (as to avoid the human immune system)?   Is it injected to a specific tissue, into the bone marrow, into an egg/sperm?  For example, often mentioned is the off-target danger of Gene Therapy for cancer.. and how modified viruses can insert themselves into any part of the chromosome, rather than the gene of interest... does CRISPR have this concern?  What percentage of cells, over which tissues would need to be altered in order to prevent the disease?  


Also, why isn't silencing the gene expression preferable?   Similarly, after the cut, if you insert your own genetic material, how do you know if this segment will get expressed?  And if making a gene edit still requires another mechanism on top to express it, how does this compare with epigenetics, RNAi/RISC complex?

Finally, on the Bio Eats World podcast, Dr. Jennifer Doudna describes how pre-Cas9,  the utility of CRISPR proteins that can target RNA for cutting wasn't very exciting (19m30s), why?   See also the Life Scientific podcast (9/19/17 16m mark)."
"Honestly, thank you so much. I have a Science Olympiad regional in two days, and they threw this topic on me last minute. I have no background in this field, and watching all these videos with words I didn't know (I basically was looking up every word). Your video gave me the basics to understand the rest of the complicated videos. Thank you again."
Really excellent video!
This video was my best choice

That was the best clip that i have ever seen about crispr. Thanks a lot.
God bless you  Paul
Such an amazing video. Great job.
Do you believe by doing crispr human are playing GOD WHY OR WHY NOT
'this bacteria' is grammatically incorrect.
this explanation was amazing omg
It was so helpful for just a short 7 min video!! Thank you!!!!
As in the days of Noah
"Thank you so much, absolutely nothing else made sense, but this did!"

Do they just do this on one piece of DNA and it changes the billions of other DNA in the body?
"Your video was really amazing. The best CRISPR video I saw so far. 
I just wanted to ask one thing ...... How is CRISPR/Cas9 system superior to other gene-editing technologies like recombinant DNA technology?"
"Is the entire human genome made up of this CRISPR 'spacer-repeat-spacer-repeat-etc.', or is CRISPR just a specific section of the genome?"
All of them are so perfect if this technique gets developed in the futurw everything will ne mor different in the future
Great job

"Awesome! But two questions... 1) why are only some bacteria resistant to new viruses if they have the ability to add new virus DNA to their watch list? Is it just a matter of which happens first, cell death vs immunity? 2) How are we able to change living cells' DNA within an organism at scale? Does one set of cells maintain the old DNA when the edited cells are mixed in? Over time do the cells reproduce and compete with one another?"

thank you so much! very clarifying!!!
"so why can't they use this to identify and neutralize DNA of a disease?  For example, if you know the genome of a disease that has invaded the cells of a person, can you then program the CAS9 to  go in and look for and identify just that offending DNA or RNA then neutralize if by cutting it or placing a nulling piece of DNA or RNA?  In our current C19 condition a solution like this seems like a great weapon...it seeks out the offending viral DNA/RNA and renders it inert."

So in the second scenario when the crispr didnt have the spacer rna required the cas protein broke the viral DNA and made a copy for future infection. If the cas protein was able to do so what was the use of space RNA in the 1st case scenario when we did have the required space?
"nice and informational video 
thanks"
Thank you so much! I participated several talks but this is my first time to understand it. Eventually. Thanks!
Can we use it to fight off Corona Virus?
Wow big respects to how you explained it. It was very easy to understand compared to other videos on the same topic.
"What I don't get,  is how now that CRISPR has fixed the existing cell's DNA,  and all is said and done... how does it fix new cells that will contain the original DNA problem?  Does one have to continue to get CRISPR injections to handle all new cell generations with the original DNA problems?  Or does the problem just get fixed going forward?"
Thank you ! :)
Thank you!
Life saver!!!! I have a test in les than an hour
In time 6:50 you said in the future we could engineer new embryo but u.s. government doctors been engineering embryo since the 70s they just kept it classified.
Excellent.  Thank you.  This is world changing stuff.

This is the best explanation of CRISPR-Cas9 on the internet! Like he said all the others have either been too simple or too complex. And I have been researching this to write an essay on it for over a month. Thankyou!
"It was not first identified en E.Coli but in ""Arqueas"" , Archaea, living in the salt flats of Santa Pola in Alicante, Spain. That was the great discovery Francis Mojica did."
Ok good.. but was basic not elaborate... didn't discuss anything on in vivo targeted delivery systems... or PAM sequence for cleavage i.e. 5' NGG for spCas9 or 5' TTTN for cpf1 etc etc....
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.

"Man, you're awesome!"
Awesome explanation. Here's how the gene editing experiments look like in the lab <a>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMhkFNEB5Sg</a>
you're boss
"this is the most beautiful video on CRISPR I have ever watched...Thank you so much, Sir! Great respect from India"
Omg! what a such wonderful video thanks!
I was awesome!!!!! Thanks for making this video!
Is the space dna the one that contains CRISPR and cas???
soi otaku i no me bano
Bless you man
3:42 Her name ends with dna !!
"This video is just amazing. I'm really grateful for what you did here, I've learnt a lot. Best wishes."
Thanks dude.
Thank you Paul - Super helpful :-)
Wow! This is really interesting
"Question : What prevents the cas protein in bacteria from breaking apart the DNA spacer in the genome of the bacteria, essentially destroying the bacterias own immune system?"
Difficult complicated issue. üòûü§î‚òπÔ∏è. I dont understand
I am surprised with the technology. I am wondering if this  could help to cure viral diseases
Thanks
THIS IS SUPER HELPFUL AND CLEAR
Thank you! You just saved my assignment. I forgot to add the deletions and insertions part after the DNA is cut- thanks!
"This vid is planned out so well without any cuts between footage
And an amazing job in explaining
Jeez Your one wonderful human being."
"thank u, I searched for 10000000 years for a simple explanation"
"Thank you, a very helpful video!"
yes
Been watching your videos since GCSE biology and I'm now studying for my final university exams in biomedical sciences... You're still helping me out! Probably will still be watching during my PhD! Thanks so much
my dad left me lol
NICE WORK THAT WAS GREAT HELPFUL !
Great teaching
ehh... meh....
How many class of Cas proteins in bacteria. I known that some bacteria like vibrio species are associated  to cas3. It is main point or not?
"Perfect video. Was scanning the web for my AP Bio test on biotechnology test, helped a lot. Thanks!"
"This man... is extraordinarily easy to follow. Hats off to you sir, your videos have saved my butt countless times. THANK YOU!!"
Great video! Helped me to understand CRISPR much better than before!
what is the PAM sequence for?
"Unnatural, disgusting... You people sicken me ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
that so helpful thank you so much for this
"I have question in 2:44. In the video, Cas protein interact with green CRISPR gene ( transcribed as crRNA) to kill off the same Green gene inserted by bacteriophage. Why does Cas protein need to interact with green CRISPR gene to eliminate the foreign green gene? Is there any chance Cas protein can recognize without the help of green CRISPR gene?  If you know, please give me some explanations about that part!"
very simply explained..... easy for understand.......thank u so much
Thank you for breaking this down.
Amazing video thanks !
"I appreciate this, thank you!"
A++
quiet helpful
"I liked the video. Good explanation of the cutting of DNA, nothing on how insertion is done, though."
"1:15¬†
It didn't so much puzzle them as they just didn't really care lol
The focus of the Ishino et al. 1987 paper is the fact that they sequenced E. coli genome. The palindromes are mentioned and highlighted in the paper but the spacers only have like a sentence or two dedicated to them.

And the paper that should get anyone a Nobel is Bolotin's. How they made the connection between CRISPR and an immune system to protect the bacteria against phages is anyone's guess."
"I'm still a little confused: when the Cas9 cuts the DNA, is it cutting the strand in half, or is it cutting part of the strand out?"

Most scientifically accurate yet simple explanation of this explosive technique. Well done!
By which Method we can insert certain DNA in host cell‚Äôs DNA
Hi Paul. Your video is fantastic. Many thanks for sharing your knowledge with the world. Greetings from Chile
Thank you for the amazing video.
I was really helpful. Thank you so much!
this helped a lot thank you
so does the crRNA come form spacerDNA(so the viral DNA) and tracrRNA come form the palindromic repeats?
Thank you so much ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Wait what can‚Äôt create bacteria to cut DNA üß¨ and not except a zombie apocalypses
"It has helped me a lot this video, thanks a lot for making it. Great job!"
Fuck offf and stop chasing me smart ass
nice lecture Sir.............
"Wow..true abomination...""I am legend"""
Great video
"One question, the loaded cas protein why not find and cut the CRISPR gene itself if it has the same sequence as the loaded crRNA?"
Does it have to cut at a palindromic sequence
"Thank you for the great video! No one has explained it better.
I was wondering if this technology can be used to introduce an opsin to mammalian cells? and in general, is there a limit to what size gene we can insert?"
What is the relationship between the¬†CRISPR/CAS9 system and restriction enzymes? Would a bacterium have one or the other? Is one more primitive/derived?
You have just helped me A LOT! been trying to understand the concept of CRISPS for quite some time and this video really helped. thank you very much.
"Near the end of the video, it would be nice if it explains how the cystic fibrosis gene is fixed, step by step. This would not only summarizes the video, but also put the step by step explanation into a visual story. Too bad."
I have been searching for CRISPR/CAS9 videos to educate myself out of curiosity. I have been disappointed because they are either too simple or too complex. Your video is an excellent balance of the two for general population (include me). I hope there will be more people learn from your video and know how to make a scientific discovery educational yet understandable for the general public. Science will get a big boost if more people understand what it is all about.
you are incredible. thank you
"You are my best Biology teacher, except for self studying. QWQ"
6:51 The future has come...
This should be the first thing you find when searching for CRISPRCas9
"""I can't find a great CRISPR video, they are either too complex or too easy:
Well sorry dude you arent really helping"
im already tracr
this is the most informative and helpful video I've found yet!
Just amazing!!! thank you helped a LOTTTT!!!
awsm sir awsm explanation sir buut how this can help in editing a new embryo
"Thanks for the video, you really explained it very well"
Thank youuuuuuuuu! THIS  WAS REALLY HELPFUL
this video is tremendously helpful! Thank you for the work!!!
I wanna be tracrRNA
THANK YOU !!!!! THAT WAS AMAZING.
"http://www.fao.org/food/food-safety-quality/gm-foods-platform/faq-for-visitors/en/
""15. Unintended effects can result from the random insertion of DNA sequences into the plant genome which may cause disruption or silencing of existing genes, activation of silent genes, or modifications in the expression of existing genes. Unintended effects may also result in the formation of new or changed patterns of metabolites. For example, the expression of enzymes at high levels may give rise to secondary biochemical effects or changes in the regulation of metabolic pathways and/or altered levels of metabolites."" 
Yup, this is about as accurate as a 1850's fowling gun..... and probably just as effective......"
"Nice to find a purely technical video and nothing else!
Thanks"
im already tracrRNA
"Amazing!
Thank You dearly for this video.
This has been the best explanation of the system I have seen so far."
Wonderfully done.  Will use your video in my Freshman class.
another complex boring video
"This video saved me so much time, thanks!"
Awesome!!!
Wow...just WOW!
Great video. Thank you so much for explaining Crispr/ cas9 so simply.
Two years later and we‚Äôre still talking about this method in classrooms. Seems like it hasn‚Äôt advanced anywhere passed academia classrooms.
Excelent video!
I used to watch you in high school and I'm listening to you again in grad school.  Who would have thought?   Great stuff!
"Excellent explanation as always, thank you."
Excelent Explanation
What a wonderful world! I just did the test about CRISPR here!! https://www.abago.org/YouTubeTest/?v=MnYppmstxIs
"Thank you very much. Just the right length and complexity between a Wikipedia entry and a local news story trying to explain CRISPR.
Just what I needed"
this helped soooo much thank youuuuu
This is exactly what popular science should be. Thank you!
Thank you!
"Damn bro! You nailed this shit! Keep up the hard work and the hustle, greetings from Spain!"
"Thanks for this nice video, it was totally understandable ;)"
"Damn. this shit is fucked yo. casually existing out there and being found only now. wack. what other things are you hiding E. coli? stop playing hard to get and show us, bitch."
Jennifer Doudna's name is actually a diss. DO U DNA???
"Awesome video. To fix the DNA of someone with cystic fibrosis though, how would you actually get the CRISPR Cas 9 system to all the cells that are affected? What if you only fix the DNA of some cells?"
What's the significance of the tracrRNA in the cas9 complex?
The cure for cancer and aids on one hand and eugenics on the other hmmmmm
"What‚Äôs the point of including repeats in crispr then, since they do nothing ?"
"I loved, thank you so much"
"PLEASE TEACH MEDICAL SCHOOL, I BEG YOU!!!"
I am not gonna pretend that I understood it completely... I understood only one thing that it is something not comprehensible to a layman.
"something I don't get with this: if you modify the DNA in a person's cell, what good does that do when they have trillions of cells?"
Will it work in human gene for knock out  gene which cause genetic disease.... Does some one use it in such cases?
I show Bozeman videos all the time to my students. You do a great job explaining things in a way most anyone can understand. I am going to share this in my biochem class in our malaria / sickle cell anemia discussion since they are looking at doing this to mosquitoes to hopefully get rid of malaria
My brain- 'Smells like burning'
simple and clear
SO HELPFUL!!!!!!!!!
"Hey thanks! I'm and undergraduate student in a Neuroscience Lab, and I'm trying to complete a knockout project involving CRISPR this semester. This was super helpful, now I just need to go do it...."
it was awsome!!!! thanks
https://youtu.be/wITqw3HXAHo
Would this help with HIV patients
"Somehow i think this could be causing cancer 
The cas9 is detecting the wrong DNA but it‚Äôs dont know how to fix it"
The truth about Crispr: https://www.naturalnews.com/2018-06-14-scientists-warn-genetic-editing-of-humans-with-crispr-technology-may-lead-to-cancer.html
Very clear explanations ! thanks!
the best !
I never realised the point of bacteria on this earth until nowüòÇ
"It‚Äôs amazing , thnx a lot"
I was searching for crispy fried fish recipes but this is pretty cool.
"Well, i think i will wait to understand this in full ramgeüòÇ"
"Read this article on CRISPR.
http://bio-technology.tk/cause-of-crispr-failure-identified-and-reversed/"
I didnt get it at all maybe I'm just stupid :/
"This is a great video! I found it helpful to check out this other video, before I watched this particular one. Cheers! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AQWMG2Lqvc"
Great explanation!!
THANK YOU
first things first can it EnLaRge mY PeEnUs?
does anyone possess this crispr system?
Very clearly explained!
"it was really helpfull, and you made it really understandable"
Damn!!!! This was perfect!
"Also iga key factor in the beginning stages of life the only way to collect its is when the water breaks it's also filled with bacteria stem cells that haven't even been discovered yet,that resist all kinds of infections fungus and bad bacteria."
This inefficient and will fail once you start messing with a genome other things will break down at the micro level and lead to symptoms of this in and at the macro level of biology.They tried this years ago and it failed only way to evolve is to enhance the immune system to eventually become so virulent that it can destroy viruses fungus infections and bacteria and even parasites.Colostrum is the only thing in nature that can do this that's why some people a are immune to even aids because of immunoglobulins that haven't been discovered yet.
"I didn't quite get how the protein is engineered to insert the proper gene. Cutting out makes sense, but it's not clear how the cas9 system is used to insert the new gene."
amazingly simple.
Bro thanks so much holy.. life saver
Thank u
Thank you so much... I have being struggling with this and in just a few minutes everything was clear!... I'm subscribing your channel!
"When he says, ""This is the DNA that we want to cut,"" at 5:35, where does this DNA come from? Is this the bacterial gene or the ""created gene""? 
Also at 6:15, when you want to cut and insert a gene and the system has 3 parts: What does he consider to be the ""host DNA."" I'm confused by the term ""host"" he is using. Are we still talking about a bacteria being the host? Or does he mean the human host whose gene is being inserted for manipulation?  
Please let me know! Thank you!"
"great video i ve heard abt crispr-cas9 system before but i didnt understand in detail how it works! you made me figure that out, lots of thanks"
So can you make a mutant out of this machine? Lol
It is the best video I think i've seen since I knew about this thing!!!! Thank You Paul Anderson Sir!!!
"Hey I am doing a project about optogenetics and needed to add an explanation for crispr cas9, your video is the best explanation I have found yet! Thanks alot!!"
Wow my mind is blown.Thank you for explaining this perfectly.i need this so bad I hope I live to see it.Its out of this world.
"Bless these science videos on youtube that make complicated topics more simplified!! Honestly, so grateful to be living in this era of highly-developed technology which serves as a helpful learning resource :)"
"Amazing, thank you !"
It's too bad that this will lead to evil things to come. People playing God is not a good idea.
"Woah, woah, woah.
WAY too technical, bro. R u speaking Chinese?"
"this was helpful 
thanks"
"this was great thanks, better than my 2nd year genetics prof could ever do"
Loved the video. Best one so far. Comprehensible and technical!
The best explanation of CRISPR systems ! Thanks a lot!
Thank you so much. It helped a lot.
What a clear and awesome video. Thanks so much!
Very informative and inspiring video. The graphics/animation help a lot. May I ask what software do you use to make such graphics/animation? Thank you.
"Even after 2 years, you're my hero."
Nice vid was very helpful
"this video is great, very informative !!"
You are Awesome! You explained this technique in 7 mins what i couldn't understand in 2 days. Thank u so much. Channel subscribed. üòä
Excellent video thank you just subscribed
That‚Äôs great and clear. Help a lot
great vid man
Great video. You accomplished what you described in the beginning (a succinct and informative video on the CRISPR Cas9 system). Thanks for the video!
Awesome ....loved the way u explained it...
Really helpful. Thank you !
Amazing description. Please make more.
From what I've heard we can use crispr to change our DNA so I can have green eyes instead of brown
The colours of the DNA doublehelix in the image at 0:56 don't fit to the actual base code : (
"As usual - Your teaching is excellent.  I have had undergraduate and graduate courses in molecular biology, and you always give understanding that most formal courses simply don't.  I thank you for your efforts, they definitely help."
this video is essentially a condensed version of Doudna's iBiology video....just go watch that one
Hella good explanation! Really appreciate your effort in explaining CRISPR. :)
KYA BAAT HAE :*
thank you for¬†making crispr clear and understood.
Can male pattern baldness be cured by this way
"Great video. By simplifying away just the right amount of details, you revealed the working mechanism of CRISPR, which is what I was interested in.  Thanks, good job."
This was super helpful! I finally understood CRISPR! Thank youuuu :)
"This is the best video about CRISPR i've seen so far! Im having a presention in january about casposons and how they were the ""ancestors"" of the acquired immunity mechanism called CRISPR-Cas and I finally understood the meaning behind the CRISPR-Cas actions so i can finally compare these two things! Big thanks and a happy new year!!!"
wow thank you i have a masters exam on this in two weeks and this has helped my understanding a lot
"OMG I am studying medicine and I have a biochemistry test this afternoon, this helped me so much, thanks!!!!"
Can you help  with protospacer-adjacent-motif (PAM) in genomic DNA
VERY helpful!
This was exactly what I needed!  Thank you so much.
Great video!!!!
I'm currently reading the original paper published by Doudna and I'm having trouble understanding the role of RNase III in converting pre-crRNA into crRNA. Is there a video that goes into more detail?
I love you Mr. Andersen thank you
"Thank you, that was the most helpful video I've found within the past 2 weeks!"
Wow! You're so amazingly clear and helpful!! Thanks a lot üôè
Awesom
just what I was looking for - thank you!
wow I am highly impressed at how simple you made the system seem! Thank you! So glad you made this video
One of the best explanations ! Awesome !
"Thank you so much, it is so much helpful in building up the understanding of CRISPR !!!!"
Best explanation of CRISPR that's out there so far!
This is completely irrelevant but has anyone told you you look like Armin Van Buuren? lol
"Don't viruses inject RNA, not DNA?"
i love it I love your teaching
Excellent layman's explanation.
Thank you so much! You saved me!
"Thank you really i were  searching for this subject and i watched  lots of video but this one was the best finally i understand it thank you very much ^_^ ,, from Jordan ."
it is the first video that could I really help me to understand without many strange names the crispr cas 9 system
Very helpful - thank you!
"at 2:55 the new spacer appears to insert at the end of the line. In reality doesnt this get inserted in the very beginning, after the 1st repeat sequence?"
Thank you Paul !
Interesante
the best
Perfect explanation .That was very helpful thank you sir :)
Your Diagram is wrong. A previously unidentified sequence is inserted proximal to the leader sequence.
Thanks! Nice explanation.
"Hey ! pretty good. Maybe too short your explanation about the insertion of the new gene and the mechanism involves. Besides this, i heard that the power of this system is that it has a high effectivity to do the specific insertion. Is that right ?"
How would you use it in a living person? Draw blood and alter the DNA there and then inject it back into the bloodstream?
"Heyyy, I used to watch your channel for AP bio in high school 4 years ago, and here I am in senior year of college and you‚Äôre still helping me out. Thanks for such good explanations over these four years üòä"
still too hard to understand
this is fantastic and so so helpful - thank you!
"it really cleared the doubt as to how bacteria recognizes the advanced bacteroiphages during every new infection.. Those spacer DNA works,  wonders."
cas9 looks like jabba
"Thank you for that elegant explanation, sir."
This was exceptional!!
Fantastic! Thank you
"Bozeman, your videos are always very helpful! Thank you!"
"Excellent video, and like you claim, it is at the perfect level of complexity!  Just one thing:  at 06:24, did you mean host DNA and not host RNA?"
thank you for the video
Very well done! Love the animations.
this is the best explanation anywhere. i went and visited my lecturer twice asking her to explain this but she couldn't. hands down best channel ever!
so f**cking amazing!!!!!!!
It was amazingly helpful :)
"that was explained so easy! Hey, don't you need a translator for Korean?"
"This is a really awesome video, thank you so much! It was the only one out of many, many videos which really explained it well."
"I'm on a quest to make my penis glow in the dark, and I think this Crispr system is leading me on the right track.  Thanks!"
"This video is not for the faint hearted, novice who knows nothing about DNA/RNA. This is for people who fairly understand how DNA/RNA work. I wish you could do it more slowly and little more detailed. Frankly, even though I am familiar with CRISPR I didn't enjoy this fast paced video."
"very helpful, thanks!"
Does this only work in fetuses (as opposed to older entities)?
What happens when crispr cuts the wrong dna and goes rogue?
Crispr cas9 bring me a gene
What technology is used to utilize crispr?
"Also, it could help lengthen the ends of chromosomes to stop cell breakdown, and essentially make us never age"
Could you explain how can the bacteria select the interspace DNA that is not overlap with its own genome?
"You forgot about the Spanish Microbiologist  Francisco Mojica, known as the ""father"" of CRISPR-Cas9. He also deserves the Nobel Prize. Great video :)"
who would thumbs down this?! excellent and accurate breakdown of something that has been honestly vastly misrepresented in pop media reporting
You explained it very well and I understood it. Thx
I don't understand why they needed the tracr-RNA and the c-RNA to be connected in the system?
Thank you! Your explanation is great for genomic beginners like me. :)
It's a drawer your fridge for veggies.Thank you..
Man... this is legit.
"Hey man, I have a genomics degree but I have been plant breeding the last decade. I felt like I was out of the game because I do pedigree selection/conventional breeding methods. I was so curious about CRISPER and the IP battles that have been underway and will prob be going on for another decade.. thanks for the help in helping me know how this works..I thought retrotransposons were the future but I was wrong this is fucking insane."
thanks. very helpful.
"Thanks! I'm doing an independent studies class and wanted to focus on this for my topic, and needed a general understanding to jump off from this really helped!"
The best video explained CRISPR. Keep it up Mr.Anderson
how does the crispr/cas9 system affect the body globally? Do you just inject a lot of it into the bloodstream and hope that every  cell is targeted?
If we are hearing about this now...........they've been using it for 20 years
"That was such an amazing explanation. As mentioned, not too simple and not too complex either!"
This is some demonic stuff! who do we think we are?! The nerve of humans to play god! wow! May God help us!
"This is a great explanation!  It would be great if you could do another video expanding on the gRNA: the difference between crRNA and tRNA and what each piece does in the system.  This explanation is slightly hand-wavey for the crRNA.  Overall, you provide a nice depth of information and good quality explanation."
Absolutely helpful to understand
Just...awesome.
so helpful thank you!
"I love this guy, he feels like he's MY teacher, I've never met him, but it feels like I've taken his classes for years, even though I've only watched a handful of his videos, he just feels like such a great teacher!"
Do all living beings have Cas-Enzyms or do they have to be inserted into the organism along with the guide rna?
Great job very well explained
"it helped me a lot to understand this topic much more. Thank you for the great video, which balanced   complexity and informativaty very well."
"I've learned about it, thx for your vedio"
"Sir: very excellent explanation on this new endonucleases process. I did miss something between 50-58 sec of the video. I got lost with ¬†""The reason why. . .,"" ""RNA . . . hair pin turns."" Could I get a clarification; I really want to understand this for an educational¬†write-up, Thanks"
Hey Paul... this is very easy to understand and very helpful to remember.. Thank you for making this video...
Thank you so much for this incredible explanation of CRISPR Cas9! I am working on my capstone and am considering this topic as well as the Connectome.
so helpful  :D
This is so complicated good thing I didn't study molecular bio
that was helpful :)
have u seen Kurzgesaget
who else thinks this is bullshit made up to take you're money? only 1 human trail.. and they claim to have thousands of plant and animal trails. that were successful.. I call bullshit..
"it's not clear from video if crispr can live outside the cell. 
Can you make some parasitic or viral host for it to transfer to living multicelled organisms?
How do you prevent gRNA to mutate on it's own?"
Thank you so much! this video is very helpful!
Thanks!!! You explain it on the perfet level!
Thank you so much! I finally properly understand it :) exam tomorrow...
Thankyou Paul - Nottingham Plant Scientists
I absolutely love you. You have saved me from a huge fail in my final exam in a few hours.
This video is really helpful! It explicitly and clearly introduce the most fundamentals and core stuff of CRISPR-CAS9
Thanks for the clear and great explanation!
It was so helpful! Thank you so much!!!!!!
You made it so easy to understand . Thank you so much
Great video!
great video!!!! congratulations!!!
Excellent
u've always managed to make me understand everything so easily and so quickly somehow. Im grateful!! thanks
that was tremendously helpful! thanks so much :)
"Paul you not only knocked the ball outa the park, but outa the state! Great presentation, thank you!"
This was amazingly helpful!
Amazing! I've been reading articles about how it works. It has been confusing to wrap my head around but your video was much help!
"I'm in yr.7 and I'm watching this. I don't know wether to think this is a a great discovery, or something terrible... when you think about it, it could be a great genetic modifier, or (with practice) it could be changed into a weapon, similar to FEV (forced evolutionary virus) from Fallout 4 (I watched a video explaining the science by Shoodycast) but either way, this is incredibly fascinating... if only I could tell my friends about it, they wouldn't understand it unfortunately."
"""I haven't been able to find any videos out there that tell what CRISPR is. They tend to be too complex, or too simple."" *Goes on to make a complex video about what CRISPR is."
yes it was helpful. very helpful. please replace my teacher
"I'm an Undergraduate student in Biochemistry, taking a graduate biotech class, and this is honestly more helpful and time efficient than going through the book or notes.  Thanks again, I've been watching your videos since high school Bio about 4 years ago."
very AWESOME!!!!!
that was an amazing description of CRISPR. I liked the history behind it and understanding that its based off of a natural defense mechanism originating from bacterial cells fighting viruses. loved it
I got into a conversation with a guy and he told me to check out CRISPR. I'm glad I watched this. It sounded a little complicated but I have a good idea what it is now. Thanks.
0:28
"Thanks for your video, it has been very useful! But I have a one more question, what role do the PAM sequences have in all this?"
"Thank you so much for the explanation. However, you did not mention PAM sequence here."
For inserting DNA after cutting you said the third part of the system would be host RNA. As it's DNA being inserted was that a mistake or was reverse transcriptase at play but not mentioned?
YOU SIR ARE MY LIFE SAVIOUR!!! I GOT PRESENTATION ON THIS TOPIC AND I NEED TO UNDERSTAND THIS....THANKS AND ONE LIKE FOR YOU
I was a little confused on the explanation of why the sequences are palindromic at 0:50. You weren't very clear on why that's significant to genome editing.
I owe my entire undergraduate degree to Bozeman Science...
they got start splicen us wit some weird ass shit tryna make super soldiersüíÄüíÄüíÄ
Very helpful!
Thanks a lot!!!!! this is soooooo clear and helpful!!!!
Great job!
Hello! I am interested in helping translate your videos into spanish. I am a native speaker and work in translation (Facebook: Traducciones Stephanie Becker - Guatemala). Let me know! :-)
thank you so much. I finally understood CRISPR system!!
Brilliant job!!
good work!
Was there suppose to be a G G that base pair together? (8 up from left and 8 up from right G-G) Awesome video though!
Great explanation !!
If only most college professors would be more like you. Thank you.
Very helpful tutorial. Thank you.
"This is amazing, I would love to join your team. Perfectly explained."
this is the most accurate explanation. good job
"Hi, at 6:40, do we know how to use this kind of method at the level of a whole organism? (in which a huge part of its cells and associated genetic material should be fixed?) how do we affect/fix a huge number of cells? (thx in advance)"
Ïß±ÏûÖÎãàÎã§~~
I bet you this is one of the best explanations I have heard in CRISPR CAS9 SYSTEM...
Loved it!
"Have looked at so many other videos about CRISPR, but only yours made a difference and helped me understand it in a very memorable way! Once again- Thank you!!"
wow this one is the best explanation !
I just want to say thank you for all your hard work. I can say that if it wasn't for you i would be really struggling in AP BIO
"I don't care about any of these, my question is... Can I change my DNA to  grow claws through sheer will and heal at accelerated speeds?"
Perfect the night before my final!
thanks
PERFECT EXPLAINED!
I am studying synthetic biology. The video is very nice in terms of not to complex not to easy. Thank you
"I found this video very helpful, but I still don't know where the host RNA comes from."
Wow this is amazing. And it makes sense even to a layman like myself. Thank you for this! Gives me great hope for the future :) science rocks!
This video was very helpful. I'm in college and I am learning about this stuff right now. It really broke down the information into stuff I can actually¬†understand. Thank you!
an amazing video thank you for this.
"I'm am trying to advocate for this and similar science. A question I get asked is whether or not scientists actually see these cells, the DNA, RNA. etc. and how they manipulate the parts. I understand we can see cells under a microscope, and I found some info about a microscope that can allow us to kind of see DNA....I guess the problem in part with all this is that we laypeople don't really know if we can believe and understand any of this. How can scientist study, much less manipulate something so small? Are these images symbolic and theory or can I accept the idea that they look like the pictures and models provided? Further, it's not like scientist are going in with tweezers placing little strands of RNA material into a cell similarly to what we've all seen with fertilizing an egg.  So what do I tell people? Further what is the procedure for finding and collecting these strands of DNA or RNA? You see that I'm struggling even to know how to ask the question..."
"I've watched a lot of videos about this topic, and this has by far been the most helpful! Thanks so much!!! You explain it really well to a high school student who is doing a speech on this. :)"
"Create new humans.. I really feel that CRISPR is going to cause global conflict,¬†both in a society on its ethics and between ""edited, advanced"" societies and us ""normal"" people. Thoughts?"
Great video Paul!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nice explanation..
You just saved my life
Very good video that explains CRISPER in simple terms. Thanks.
This guy is amazing
Does this mean we can be expecting the creation off real Xenomorphs? üòâ
annnnnnnnnnnd i just forgot it all
Best explanation I've seen!  Thank you.
really nicely explained in simple terms!!
This video is perfect! I had such a hard time finding a video that explained the concept in an understandable manner and not too bogged down in jargon and excessive detail. Thank you so much!
thanks! this is amazing!!!
this was a fantastic explanation ..
"Could we replace the KKK, BLM & SJWs?"
"I have understood that when a new type of phage  infects the bacterium,  a cas-protein will cut a piece out of the viral dna to become a spacer, which can then be used to guide another type of cas-protein to cut viral dna the next time the bacterium is infected by that virus. My question is then, why is the first type of cas-protein not sufficient to defect viral dna? I mean, the first cas-protein cuts a piece out of the viral dna to make it a spacer, but by doing this, at the same time it inactivates the virus. Why is this mechanism of creating spacers to guide type 2 cas-proteins necessary, when the type 1 cas-proteins can cut viral dna without needing a guide?"
"ƒ± did not understand at 6:26. Host rna or host dna we want to put into the dna, first you said rna and then dna, im confused and this is important, i was thinking we insert host dna into the genome where we want to add , can you clarify this,"
You've made CRISPR/Cas9 really clear to me. Thank you!
What a terrific explanation!!
"I have a question. So, say we go ahead and replace a faulty DNA with a good one. Do we do that in all the cells? How does one correct gene migrate to all the cells that have the faulty gene?"
Wow! Very good explanation of CRISPR! Thankl
Women ROCK! THey re going to solve anti aging! Woohoo --- get to work another 300 years :)
Very helpful video sir..............Good explanation also
"That was great, thanks!"
Wait this video is great.
This was extremely helpful information. This really helped me find a way to map out my SIP. Thank you so much!
"I realy can't understand how the gRNA binds to the cas9, I mean when have the CAS9 and the gRNA that we have just synthesized,which are both two separate macromolecules,what should we do to bind the two together properly ."
Thank you. That is the BEST explanation I've seen.
Great video!  Perfect level of detail!

"Very helpful video, i finally understood this topic :) thank you very much!"
"Thank you^10!
I read over and over again and struggled to understand and keep it in mind, after a week it was gone again.
Your illustrations and explanations did a wonderful job!"
Could CRISPR be used to make f.e. following changes on someone who is already adult? Change color of eyes? Reverse hair loss? Trigger growth of a new set of teeth? Fix arthritis? Improve oxygen intake and body recovering from sports? Improve hearing? Improve eyesight?
Dude talks way too fast.  Who's his audience?  Seems to have testosterone phage issues.  Too smart for our own good.  Let's backtrack and listen again.
Thank you so much for this video! Just the right information I needed!
No
This is the perfect level of depth for me accessible enough to go in with only basic prior knowledge (High School Bio) and be able to understand the inner workings of this gene editing method . Thanks! :)
it was really nice  and well explained thanks alot :)
Awesome video! The best I have ever seen on CRISPR system. The only suggestion would be to show more clearly how the insert DNA is provided to the system in the cells. Is it fused to gRNA or it has to be provided separately.
Is the tracrRNA made from us? I mean we dont find it somewhere in the cell right? we create it?
"Great vid, very helpful and at the right level IMHO - thanks!"
You're amazing. Thank you!!!!
Isn't palindromic DNA impossible? (Guanine can't bind with Guanine)
Very helpful!
What causes alzheimers? Did I spell that correctly?
Thanks but you should go into more detail in the molecular part of it
Very helpful !
You are so amazing
Thank you so much for explaining this in an easy way
I have found this really helpful for my presentation. Thank you so much!
"That sounds great, we always hear about new techniques and experiments going on. The question is when do humans take a real practical and effective advantage of that?"
THANK YOU for this! I was really struggling to understand CRISPR and so was my class. It was extremely helpful and very well explained.
very helpful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!111
wow! you really make molecular biology so simple! damn it! i had to click on the subscribe botton as fast as i could :) it was an amazing video :3
"Fantastic! I just wanted to point out a mistake: when CAS1 inserts a spacer into the host DNA it is added UPSTREAM (ie: closer to the CAS gene), not downstream. This is due to a ""polar"" acquisition leading to a sequential ""hierarchy"".

Otherwise great video, you continue to be my fall-back resource for exam preps. :)"
"Very helpful, finally got a clear view of what CRISPR really is!!"
amazing video. Thank you so much for this.
"This video is really really great!
Thank you so much for making this video!
I love it sooooooooooooo much!!!"
ur awesome!!!!!
"Thank you for the amazing video! What is funny is that I have been watching your videos for help ever since my first undergraduate bio class. I'm now in my senior year and am taking molecular biology. When my professor came across this topic in class she said "" here's a great video that sums everything up"" and sure enough, it was your video! Just goes to show you are not only helping students, you are helping professors clarify the material. Keep up the stupendous work and thanks again!"
great job in describing the crispr!
What program do you use to make your presentations?
"He is the best!!! 
have watched his videos since I start my bachelor of science degree"
thanks
Great video!!! I just wondered how one can manage to introduce single oligos into human cells that will be integrated instead of degradated... ?
"Thank you so much, needed help understanding this for my Biochem class!"
Great video! Even the scientists who discovered Cripr/Cas9 don't explain that well.
this saved my life thank you
You hope that was helpful? That was freaking revealing!!! Been looking for a very understandable explanation of CRISPR for a while now until I saw this video. Thanks a lot. Subscribing to your channel
How does the class 1 CAS protein recognise the foreign DNA? How does it break down the DNA and incorporate the foreign DNA into the CRISPR system?
"Best explanation, thanks for share!"
great vid ever on crispr! many thanks.
"Great video, thanks for explaining in easy way how CRISPR works!"
thank u this is so helpful
It was very helpful. Thank you for the video
i wondering how they do to progamme a gRNA ?
thank you for the awesome video!
Thank you
"Seeing all these possibilities of CRISPR/Cas9¬†made me think, why was it impossible using gene splicing? To me it seems that gene splicing allows exactly the same things: isolating a specific gene, cutting DNA at a specific point and inserting that isolated gene into this point. So it should allow all these awesome things like inactivating a mutated gene and replacing it with the healthy version. Why isn't it the case? I've heard things like ""previous techniques were much less precise and efficient"". If so, why is CRISPR/Cas9 better at these points?"
I wish I could see what a genetics lab looks like and how each step is done. How do they manipulate such small and fragile things?
You are saying viral DNA enters the cell but virusses don't have DNA right? They only have RNA. Or am i mishearing something?
"More people have heard about it now:
Kurzegesagt and SciShow have now made vids on it."
"Thank you so much Paul.. you saved me from reading a bunch of introductory articles. 
I got all what I need in 7 min !! incredible man 

Despite what it could bring of harm to nature but it is an awesome topic and discovery."
"I used to watch your videos in high school, and now I found myself watching this one for college, thank you Bozeman Science!"
"oh my god! haha bozeman I always end up coming back to watch your videos, been watching for a few years now :D keep it up!"
Excellent video and well explained! Exams are looming and I can't thank you enough!
"Thanks Paul , you explained such a complex topic with great ease. Great job"
"Good explanation, very clear. Thank you!"
"This is amazing, thanks! very helpful"
"Thank you, You explained perfectly"
"6:30 ""As we break the DNA, the host DNA is going to be added""

Fascinating. And what is the magic involved in this?"
Thanks a lot for the information Paul! It was helpful for me.
"can i use the info you mentioned here in a presentation i'm making? if yes, how can i reference you or your sources?"
I don't like u
you definitely made it very clear! very helpful! thanks!
"how come the cas9 protein can produce overhangs. I mean like of I am interested in introducing a certain gene into the to be manipulated genome,  it is better to produce overhangs like the case of restriction enzymes so that the DNA stand to be added can hybrid with the overhangs eventually being a part of the genome."
"If CRISPR-CAS9 system was introduced into the body how long will it last, like an expiration or something?"
"Very good explained and not long, super!"
Great work! Thanks.
"I love love love your videos!!!
And I especially love this video!

What program do you use for your animations?"
Christian Youtube Heroes is gonna mass flag this for sure XD
Your video was a big help! Thank you!
"That was super helpful, thank you for taking the time to explain it,"
"I wonder if some day there will be a pubic API for rewriting genetic code from home
Python could literally allow you to program a python"
"Sounds great but just think if we would have never started experimenting with humans, animals and our food we wouldn't have to search for a cure for diseases or altering DNA. Most diseases are man made, civilization has created their own issues. Greed has created most of our difficulties. Altering DNA will only create more problems as it has in the past. Instead of creating new diseases and focusing on creating new ones why don't we go back to the natural order of things. We have enough land and resources if used correctly to sustain humanity. Just as we are using science and technology in unknown ways to advance civilization soon technology will takeover and everything will be computerized. This will limit human creativity in every way.If you think you're bored now wait until the computers take over."
This was shorter and better visually and verbally articulated than Doudna's own TED talk.  Thank you for breaking this down so well!
"So I've just watched half a dozen videos on CRISPR, including this one, and none of them explain how the system can enter every singe cell in a living organism. All the videos (including this one) only explain it once you get the CRISPR/CAS9 into a single cell. How do you get it into a single cell to begin with? And how do you get it into EVERY SINGLE CELL inside a living organism? Can someone explain this? Thanks."
I like this! Thank you!
Great explanation thank you
I started my freshman year in college with your videos. Here I am in my senior year still studying from them! Thank you!
Seananners made me search and find this video.
"love this video, thanks :)"
"love this video, thanks :)"
Nice jop... again
Hey I need help. I'm in 6th Grade and I have a project about CRISPR that is due on Monday next week but I literally don't even understand a bit of this
SUPER erkl√§rt
I was excited to do a YouTube search for CRISPR and see your video as the second hit. Thank science for your videos! You are one of the best on the site.
Where do I find the more complex video?
Nice.
"could this be used for infections like herpes, where they lie dormant making it harder to fight with conventional methods. They remain inside the nuclear envelope, attached to your own DNA, until activated by stress for example, where it replicates and causes those outbreaks.  Could the CRISPR method be used to fight the virus, once activated, eventually eliminating the virus in what ever specific time frame is established, thus being considered curable?"
aaaaaawesome!!!!!
Such an eloquent explanation. Thank you.
what a fantastic balance between information and understandability
wow this was brilliant !! thank you!
"Great video, thanks !"
very well explained..
Damn humans are going to hell
"Thank you si much for this, it was simple, understandable and straight to the point. Thnks a lot."
"Best explanation I've seen yet, thanks much."
"MINOR quibbles: 1) usually new spacer-repeats are added at the proximal, not distal, end of the CRISPR locus; 2) This is NOT ""exactly"" how mammalian immune systems work (""just on a larger scale"") as you've stated; 3) HOST DNA, not RNA, is used in gene replacement. Nice graphics!"
"Much appreciated, great presentation and quality content, thanks:)"
thats cool
"Very informative, thank you."
Holy fuck people are computers.
great video!! THANKS!
excellent!
excellent explanation !!! great job
"Brilliant, thank you!"
"Hi, the video does help and explains a lot, but I still don't get why is CRISPR that much better than using restriction enzymes and plasmids?"
Simply amazing thank you so much for making it very easy
very helpful dude thx a lot
Thanks! This was excellent. I wonder how the class 1 CAS protein can add new pieces of viruses to the library and distinguish harmful RNA from endogenous RNA?
"It seems that scientists can use this system to insert, but not remove DNA. I wish they could just cut the unwanted DNA at both of its ends instead of at only one end at a time, so that it would be removed from our DNA. An editing system that can write, but not delete, is severely limited. Instead of trying to remove DNA, scientists will just try to fill it up with garbage in order to break it. That will make the DNA very messy and will make it much harder to actually perform deletions later in case they discover later how to finally accomplish that. I don't relish the thought of having my DNA made more messy and even harder to edit later because of this technique. I'm hugely disappointed by scientists yet again as usual; this was very overhyped."
"This was great video, thank you for simpe explanation mister. But I'm wondering what software you are using for this video? It is similar wits MS POwer Point, but I'm not quite sure. Maybe some other software with it.

Thank's in advance,
Nikola"
"Great presentation, thanks."
"very helpful explanation :)

one question though, in what cases does the phage manage to infect bacteria then? do not all bacteria have it? and if not, at a certain point won't all bacteria have it (via evolution) and then will the phages become extinct?"
i thought it is very complex procedure but u explain it very simply and beautifully.. Thank you
Awesome Mr Andersen!
perfect narrative!
"I am not a microbiologist, but have been reading ""The Gene"". This video really helped me. Thanks"
"Thank you, nicely explained"
"Frightening. Look what we created with lifeless Uranium, Plutonium & heavy water."
simple dimple
Thank you. NLP has a bit on it too
Great one sir
awesome video! very helpful! Thank you :)
Great Help thanks !
"definitely helpful, thanks a lot!!"
I watched another video where  pigs and dogs have been created from this process.
very helpful thank you so much!!!
What is the vector for the new DNA? Does it just come with the Cas9?
build in a rso/rno multible gain changer....the proteine will then change the key
Super ! perfect video. thanks
"Have been looking for a good comprehensive video on the CRISPR CAS9 system for a while, so happy to have stumbled upon this one! Thank you so much!"
its Awesome....!!!!!
"I have a question, so the CRISPR/Cas9 system can edit genes and the cell will divide with that DNA, but what happens to the existing cells? Do we have to make changes to every existing cell in the body of an adult if they were diagnosed with a disease after they were born?"
great!
"Best explanation so far, thanks Paul."
Comments to me will be so vile they be x rated because people are being striped of their humanity and cannot feel for others or understand the natural world getting manipulated by dr mengele types are operating right now and crisper another road to suffering .
So you want evil people messing with DNA who can't even treat a dog with compassion. Seriously stop being taken for a ride.
Thank you sooo much!! I'll do a presentation in school about that Topic an basically it's going to be your explanation in german :)Best material that I've found in the Internet! :)
"In theorie, can you cure neurodermitis with this system? Because the tend to get neurodermitis is genetical. I really hope this could be a way, because I suffer from this and it destroys my life... I was active and a firefighter and now I cant do a bit of sports because everytime I sweat my skin goes rampage mode and I look like a burning victim..."
Using this to modify an embryo can make a whole organism with the change. But how can we use it to cure diseases? We'd need to apply this change to a very large number of cells.
This helped A LOT. Thanks for the video!
what the fuck
Awesome Work. Really helped. Thank you.
Dr. Andersen... that was indeed helpful!! Thanks for the post.
"A question for you at 6:14. There you say you want to make it more complex and insert a new gene. You add a third part to the system, no.3, the gene to be added. Now, is this sequence simply added to the construct for the Cas9 vector or is it co-transferred with another vector? And is the ligation still done by the Cas9 enzyme or by other ligases? Thanks..."
"This is awesome, thanks !"
Very helpfull!! Thanks!
awsum.. i loved the way u hv simplified the whole technique.. it was of grt help.. thnks a ton!!!
very good for the noob like me on this topic/technology -Thx
"great video , thanks"
THANK YOU for helping me understand this. I'm back to school 15 years after my degree and I'm a bit rusty. Understanding these abstract concepts can be really hard and your animation and explanation finally did the thang. THANKS THANKS THANKS a thousand times thanks!
This is so helpful!! Thank You
"Thank you now i understand what is going on with this, i'm not very good at biology, holy shit that is fantastic, it will change the course in history of biology, medicine and bioengineering."
"Excellent summary,  The implications are both exciting and potentially frightening."
"THIS WAS FANTASTIC THANK YOUUUUUU, saved me on an exam!"
so easy to understand!
"Great Video! You're really good at explaining! You got the abo ;)

I hope you are a teacher, if not, please become one ;)"
Thank you so much! This video was very helpful and far easier to understand than others!
Very informative explanation. Paul Anderson made it crystal clear.
As a cystic fibrosis patient and a molecular biology student I can say this is a very clear explanation. Thank you
"Very helpful, thank you!!"
Your a boss!!!! Thank you!!
"Very helpful, but how does the cell store the old virus info in the correct location so it can fight future infection?"
Thanks Mr Bozeman :)
That was really really helpful. Thank you so much!
"This was extremely helpful, people kept on mentioning it in class and now I can finally join in on the conversation! Thanks for making this video!"
Could you prefer me your software program which you used to create such a interesting lesson? ) I need it
thank you! you just saved me for my biology exam
#nobelprize lol
Bozeman Science single handedly saving my ass from grade 9 to year 1 university. Thanks a lot
"I've been struggling to understand this for months since I covered it in one of my final year modules, but this explained it incredibly well, thanks very much!"
I love these talks!!! Simple and extremely helpful!
Very good video. It does fill in the spaces left by other videos. One question: How is the replacement gene incorporated into the cut strand?
"excelent video! Now, how do you create the gRNA?"
so is crispr kind of like the find-and-replace tool in Microsoft word?
Thank you very much! This was very helpful!
Thanks for this info.
"Absolute bangin'  video Paul. Helped a lot for my exams.

A question for you, and the science community, what do you are the challenges now with the CRISPR/Cas system (maybe a video...) -- specially when it comes to gene therapy? Is an efficient vector-delivery system still posed as our greatest barrier? 

Any idea on the efficiency of this system? Delivery, disruption of important genes..."
Nice and neat
So cleared explained! I'm about to have a presentation on this topic and can't understand it after reading some research articles. Your video makes everything understandable now. Thank you~
That's Awesome.. thank you sir for your beautiful explanation...
Beautiful video Paul! Thank you so much. Very helpful for my exam in two weeks time! Keep your fingers crossed for this question coming up! x
"I havent finished the video yet, still watching, but that explanation right before the 3:18 mark is so cool, it reminds me of megaman xD absorbing the enemy power. Awesome"
his picture of cas9 looks like a manatee or that other sea mammal
Thank you. Nice video :)
i have a final in a few hours and this helped tremendously thanks!
Wait do they add in RNA or DNA? Or is it primers of DNA (essentially RNA) ?
THANK YOU!
spednign only 10 minutes instead of spending hours to read paper. Thanks
I laughed at the #NobelPrize more than I should've.
You guys are awesome.
that WAS helpful..thank you!
very well explained!! thanks a lot!
"please, would you make a video on the  muscular system lab. I have been looking for a video online but there  are not any good  video."
Thank you for the clear explanation!!!!
hi!can you plz tell me any recent amazing research in genetics and biochemistry....other than crispr cas 9 that has role in treating different diseases.....
How's the development in CRISPR Cas9? Are they testing it out on humans now?
your videos are so beneficial!! just watched one and couldnt stop :))) please keep up the good work
"Paul, I looked for this video on your website and I couldn't find it. Can you direct me to it? Under which section should I look for it? Thanks... :)"
"you have no idea how helpful your videos are! i really wish u could cover higher terms in physiology or other subjects, i tried googling things that you didn't cover but seriously no one can actually explain things the way you do! so interesting, simple and in a really short time, u don't waste time on introducing or wtv, plus your examples stick within us ! thanks a lot you are the reason i pass my exams ;)        

oh and excuse my  English it's not my mother language"
"Love the video, so helpful"
"Thanks , Now I can go around and teach my pals at university . :)"
"Helpful? Hell yes. Thank goodness for those pioneering scientists, we can do so much with this! Great video!"
The most helpful video I've found about this topic by far. Thank you very much for the information.
"semple, easy and understandable. 

amazing 

thanks a lot"
"Nice video, but I noticed you glossed over the tcrRNA bit. It seems to be like an arming mechanism for the protein. Also not clear yet is how the palindrome/tcrRNA part of the gRNA sequence can vary. Does it have to have a specific sequence for Cas9 to work? Lastly it is not clear how Cas1 identifies new foreign sequences to be added to the CRISPR system."
fantastic video! thanks!!!!!
It took our teacher 45 minutes to explain this in class and countless hours for students to understand it. This guy did it in just 7 minutes. I would be a biology major if he was my teacher.
CRISPER dna and the thymus.  Any correlation?
"this gives up hope on many medical frontiers, thanks for explaining it with detail."
I didn't truly understand what CRISPR was until I watched this. Great job breaking it down.
I mean a Skype invitation.
"Hello Mr Paul I am Musa a middle school Science teacher in Saudi Arabia.I am very crazy about using technology in my classes and this had made my students to watch several of your videos.Recently I promised to invite you to speak with them about a particular topic they have taken before  just for few minutes so that they can  have the chance of speaking with you directly and asking you questions.please i will be glad to get your response into my personal email.We really love your videos.
hope to read your response soon Sir.Thanks"
"THIS IS PERFECT!!!
I was so confused about what CRISPR was until this video!"
Great video!
supper helpful!! Thank you so much!!!
"wow, that was good!"
"Mr.Anderson, your endeavor to educate kids through your very beneficial videos is very intriguing. Not only do i like the overall idea of your website, but i learn a great deal more in my path to get a 5 on the Ap Biology Exam. Thank you very much, for as per my knowledge this is an nonprofitable website."
"Fantastic video, I was just reading a paper about guide RNA and couldn't figure it out, thanks Broseman."
"I am an AP Biology teacher and am always recommending your videos to explain topics.  I recently came across CRSPR in the news and was discussing it with some of my more seasoned bio students.  When I got the NSTA digest and YOUR video was in there....I was ecstatic!  It was like two worlds meeting.  Anyhow, great job.  Thanks for keeping up with everything."
"Great explanation, but still a bit more detailed than what I need for my entry-level tech-college horticulture students.  Can you suggest a Bozeman Science video that gives a simple explanation of genetically engineering plants for herbicide resistance or insect resistance/tolerance?"
Thank You! You are absolutely right about the videos out there. I had to do a report on CRISPR/Cas9 last semester and struggled to figure everything out. This video would have helped out greatly. I can't wait to try out my own experiments with it! :)
"Awesome as usual, thanks a lot!"
"Hey Paul--you knocked it out of the ball park again! This is a hot topic, and we love how you break it down in terms everyone can understand."
great explanation! thank you!
Thanks very much!  I've been looking for a good explanation of this.  Are you at Montana State?
Thanks so much this is really helpful.
hi I was wondering what the cellular level is please respond k have a hard science lab
"Hey Mr Anderson
Im Tessa and Im a gr11 biology student. Previously you have demonstrated in one of your videos the four main plant types. For example the Angiosperms. If you have time could you maybe go into detail on that? It would really help alot!"
Thanks! We just had this in class and I didn't get it but this really helped! :D
"Mr Anderson never fails to explain things thouroughly! Just remember this was discovered in e coli, a genome we know better than our own. Just imagine what natural selection/biodiversity has already made out there for us to use in the future."
"Do you have videos on cell signaling? Signal transduction pathways, Camp, adenyl cyclase, pip2, etc.... I am reallt confused on that."
Bozeman thank you for making a video about CRISPR I love genetic engineering and its nice to finally see videos about the most talked about tool in its arsenal. IF you want to make more videos i'm fine with that lol
I could've used this 2 months when I did a AP Biology project on CRISPR. Lololol. All the other videos were trash.
"Amazing video, keep doing this. Like it. Greetings form Novi Pazar, Srbija."
cool that you also made a video about CRISPR :D I've been working with it for two years now :)
"Your ego denies you insight, vaccines contain a plethora of toxic substances. Stop believing the mainstream bullshit. The cure for cancer is being suppressed not researched hahahaha!!!! No profit in cure.."
great video! very helpful and informative
"This is so awesome - no, it's frightening - Awesome! - Frightening! - Damn, I can't decide. Guess it's both."
I needed this video two weeks ago ;-; still great help!
Is CRISPR/Cas a part of a plasmid? Thanks
"Ctrl + A, Ctrl + X, Ctrl + V"
"I wonder if the genetic engineering will reach the ""germ line"" cells, particularly men who are always making new sperm cells"
"Thank you so much, your lessons are always so clear and interesting!"
Helpful summary.  Thank you for posting.
Thats some badass shit
