"So I’ve done some thinking, and I think that the black holes probably better to describe the journey of my thoughts.
So if you got something or anything falling into a black hole, and it starts to speed up faster and faster and faster to the speed of light. 
Everything breaks apart by the force of gravity, falling faster and faster and faster not because the speed of light, but because the speed of the medium is being sucked into the hole, all the particles be split and torn apart everything is torn apart, spaghettified is a simpler term but loses its meaning as you would imaging noodles, but noodles is a thing, and this is not a thing, further and further this is  more deeper everything gets torn apart explosive energy so maybe that some will be transmitted out as some  Hawking radiation I assume.

But it doesn’t stop there because you’re gonna fall further than the distance from the horizon, to the center, how to describe it, the core of the black hole is infinitely far away you’ll never reach there. 
You’ll evaporate well belong before you can get there as it  much muuuuuuuch further than the horizon is from the center, so It can’t be explained in normal physics. I think you have to imagine Interdimensionaly there is no end and to get there the fabric of space is stretches faster than the speed of light can travel, the wave of lengths will be stretched so thin to be longer than red light can stretch, quarks and gluons etc will be pulled apart. And exploded.

🧭 time has no meaning, the decay of particles will slow to a mear stop, the explosions as a little particle bodies are torn apart will slow to a mear stop, as to be traveling faster than light relative, the medium stretching faster than light can travel. 
Perhaps 🧐 maybe the medium of space time has been torn apart as well?
It’s quite paradoxical, thinking I know to have explosions that don’t decay to have particles that don’t care but yet they get torn apart, that’s all  my little brain can take 🧠

If you could see inside the black hole, everything would be curved back towards the center. If you tried to look out, you couldn’t see it. if you could just see the point where everything is going, the center is in every direction because light is being curved back towards a center, but no you can’t see anything as light can’t come back from the center
And every direction is towards the center from your perception because the lights always curving back towards the center of which is unreachable…  like I said brain 🧠 go boom 💥 🤪😵‍💫

🤪Haha I hope that makes sense 🤪

The mas of the black hole 🕳️ is all  accumulated mass within it even though those particles may not touch each other ever as they’re being torn apart for further towards the center closer now but not closer you’ll never reach there…

🤔 hmm my mind is turning to mush
Think of it like a suspended try you put a hose with running water on it,
Then poke a hole 🕳️ in the tray 
The water will spiral towards a hole due to earths spin and gravitation and maybe magnetic fields.
Then down through the hole into a laminate flow, then as it falls faster, the flow will pull apart into droplets, the droplets will pull apart due to earth’s gravity faster against the air medium, and probably break apart to smaller droplets.
And allow those droplets to fall through a Dyson ring fan on full power!
Or a compressed air blower venturi and the droplets will be split & separated further into a fine mist…

Then you’ll need a particle accelerator to speeds where high speeds can be accomplish on earth,  but we need to go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter. Than we can accomplish to do on earth… 
Interdimensionally faster!

Is your brain all gooey & squishy now? 😵‍💫🤪🥰😁🤣😂🤪"
Awesome
"Sadly, science went out of Brian when he became a disciple of the global warming religion."
If time stops from our point of view then why do we still see stars fall into black holes or two black holes collide?
"∂I/∂t = ∇²I - ε ∇S + Γ 

God is behind all mathematics."
"Though Dr Cox is a great and very clear presenter, I still can't grasp some of the concepts. Fascinating."
"Is a black hole solid? I mean is it made up of atoms or have the electrons, protons, neutrons been crushed down to one thing or are touching?"
Send me into a black hole
Keanu Reeves.
"1- There is no such thing as a black hole. These jokers point a multi-band width detection device at an area of space and if there is an area that is dark , they call it a black hole..lol  It could be space dust, gas, nebula's etc. Not some evil black hole lurking and waiting to swallow you and your galaxy up.. Good grief Charlie Brown.
2- Time does not slow down the faster you travel.  If you get in a spaceship and fly to a planet that is 10 light years away and you can travel at the speed of light,  here's what happens . (Leave the acceleration and deceleration phase out of the equation for the sake of this scenario) You would travel 10 years outbound and 10 years back. That's 20 years folks. Pretty simple math. When you come home you will therefore be exactly 20 years older and magically your friends and family on earth will also be 20 years older . You will not have aged 2 years while everyone back on earth magically aged 250 years .  (Like every b movie portrays)
(Maybe your wrist watch ran faster or ran slower while you were in zero gravity  but its irrelevant) You travelled a distance of 20 light years at the speed of light.  That takes 20 years .... full stop.
2+ 2 = 4. It always was and always will be .
In fact , I hereby declare that I have discovered that which eluded Einstein. I have found the one  ""Theory of Everything""      It's the one equation by which all things in the universe must function.   2+2=4.
All physics , calculus and Quantum Conundrums all must eventually be solved to adhere to this simple truth ... 
                           2+2 = 4"
The catharsis of stasis dictates the Arrow of Time. The terrible curse or a welcome boon?!
"Therefore, the catharsis of stasis means all information cannot be salvaged and reclaimed."
"If all information can be reconstructed, then there would be no possibility for information to arise at all in the first place and the only information ever available must be first information. Period. Because there would be no scope or chance for learning, mutation, unlearning, or energy caught in a pattern and trapped and locked up as information, for every the only form or only pattern from the etymology of the word information; that is, you are informed in-form about only one thing, only one form or meaning to data; for example, a tadpole is the only thing in-form or the only and final form, in-formed; therefore, you deny a packing up and locking of a tadpole. Period. But nature has other ideas; it exploits quantum tunneling to unweave the intricate tapestry of a tadpole and then weave a even more intricate and complicated tapestry of a fully fledged frog allowing ample room for metamorphosis or translation or change of basis vectors or negotiation and renegotiation, construction and reconstruction, what I mean is form, inform, and finally transform or learning, learning updates, information--continued learning is possible but will be impossible if all information can be put together again if and only if it is the one and only information ever--reforming information, finally stasis when the learning curve plateaus out, over fitting, unfit for new learning being cursed as the best fit. What now? OMG! It is all over for the tadpole, dead end compounding stasis, bludgeoning Atrophy, impending extinction! Lo! Behold! Here comes the Messiah, the saviour, nature and performs a miracle: the purging, the Castrol, the catharsis of stasis which is releasing the toxins or energy caught and trapped in a pattern and locked up as matter, time, but how? Nature shows the way not your stupid God: the catharsis of stasis exploiting quantum tunneling, the unlocking, the unpacking, the unweaving, the realising, the unlearning, the energy of freedom, sudden phenomenonal increase in learning potential and mutation potential, now learning is possible, mutation is possible, and transformation is possible and the tadpole has metamorphosed and transformed into a frog, mutation, and evolution replayed. Jiddu Krishnamurti puts it beautifully to David Bohm, Sir, it is the same energy but now it has a totally different quality(, the new); therefore and thereby Jiddu Krishnamurti abolishes external agency or your stupid God!"
Repent.
'It seems that space and time are not fundamental.' Okay. 😬

"In the BM framework, the most massive black holes did not come after stars — they came before them, as natural consequences of early-cycle curvature saturation in the cosmic lattice. Before galaxies and stars existed, the compression–curvature field was already structured. Regions where the lattice geometry reached maximum compression created King Nodes — stable, ultra-dense curvature zones that are the BM equivalent of supermassive black holes. These were seeded by:

1. Field harmonics left over from the previous cycle’s Snap Point, which concentrated mass–frequency in certain zones.
2. Baryonic corridors funnelling matter and energy into these nodes even before stars condensed.
3. Curvature saturation thresholds that were crossed without any need for stellar collapse — the field geometry itself created the well deep enough to trap light.

Later, these pre-stellar black holes acted as anchors for galaxy formation — their curvature fields drew in gas, dust, and plasma, igniting star formation around them. This reverses the traditional sequence: in BM physics, black holes make galaxies, not the other way around.

The 'strength' of these wells was never 'created from nothing' — it was the direct outcome of field geometry that had been storing and focusing curvature since before our cycle began."

"If you take a quantity of water and break it into hydrogen and oxogen , the oxogen can latter react with other elements ,like iron becoming iron oxide. What happened to the information of the original quantity that was water?. Where is the information stored? For black holes the theory is that it is stored on a 2d surface.But in a lab there is no known medium for the information."
"That is wrong. Times stops not inside black hole, but far far far outsize of universe. Easy to prove. More mass, slower speed - more time. Less mass, faster speed - less time. Closer to blackhole you are more time you have. From distanse - it looks like it slows down and object closeer to blackhole freezing. But not because it has less time, because it has more space/time fabric."

"I'm constantly looking up the holographic principle on YouTube, looking for any mention of invisibility. According to my discoveries, invisibility is the flipside to holodecks, or more generally, holography. I believe that both play a crucial role in the fabric of reality.

The event horizon of a black hole is an invisible boundary but the information of the black hole is written on it holographically. That might be a clue.

To the relativistic observer falling into a black hole, the event horizon is an invisible boundary. But to quantum virtual particles, it is a hologram!

"I have a hypothesis that what keeps a spatial structure—such as a black hole or a wormhole—open may not be gravity alone, but could instead be a force field, such as a magnetic or electromagnetic field, with repulsive properties. This field could have varying charge, polarity, or resistance in different directions, which would prevent the structure’s opening from collapsing and instead stabilize it"

"Interesting what you said in the end about what Einstein said about finding something deeply hidden. Reminded me of a revelation from God to the Holy Prophet Mohammad pbuh, about why He created human beings: ""I was a hidden treasure, then I desired that I be found."" The Quran encourages and praises people who ponder over the creations of the Heavens and the Earth: ""In the creation of the heavens and the earth and in the alternation of the night and the day there are indeed Signs for the people of understanding; those who remember God while standing, sitting, and lying on their sides, and ponder over the creation of the heavens and the earth: (saying) 'Our Lord, Thou hast not created this in vain; nay, Holy art Thou; save us, then, from the punishment of the Fire.'"" (3:191-192, Holy Quran)"
"As I have previously stated, there can be no ""sitting on the fence"" (or anything close to it)-- Top Down cosmology is either mostly right or terribly wrong.
 
The biggest problem with Bottom Up BBT cosmology is the problem of entropy, central to thermodynamics and the virial theorem, stating in its simplest form that ""for a stable, self-gravitating system, the average kinetic energy of the particles is equal to half the negative of the average potential energy."" With the Big Bang theory, the early universe was too hot to form particles, including the Higgs boson and the yet-to-be-found (and still theoretical) graviton, meaning that there would have been no gravity and no space time.
 
This is a major problem with Big Bang explanations which systematically ignore it by simply stating that light of the Big Bang cooled by expansion and ""condensed"" to initially form the lightest particles. Without space time, what does ""expanding"" even mean?
 
In physics, there is the axiom called Occam's Razor: ""Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one. It's also known as the 'law of parsimony'. Essentially, when faced with competing hypotheses that all explain the same phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions is preferred.""
 
What can be simpler for the initial unity in the form of a ""primal atom"" required by both Top Down and Bottom Up cosmologies to divide into two, with proto-gravity/ Coulomb effects being initially equal and indistinguishable?. Yet the theory that requires ad hoc fixes every time there is a new discovery is preferred over the theory that actually predicts and accommodates discovery. In this Top Down quantum world, any creative hand was only required to invent math. The odds for intervention of that creative hand at any time are 50:50 at best, or ""too close to call.""
 
The Standard Model, initially devised in 1929 to prevent conflicts between religion and science, has only ensured that the two never find middle ground; hence, the current discord from the religious right regarding global warming and Darwin's evolution, among others."
Black holes don't exist even Stephen Hawkins admits now.
"The empirical method is most reliable in finding truth in the physical world. It employs the logic of mathematics in finding most probable outcome given a controlled set of variables. Religions are not concerned with that, and often depend upon intuition, emotions and customs not dependent upon objective reality found in scientific endeavors like physics.
 
Given that it is generally understood in the scientific community that the universe came from a single massive event, to begin to understand where we came from, there must be a theory that has reliable, predictive ability,
 
There is always the unknown (or ""God of the gap""), like when questioning the origin of the initial mass; but that is not required in order to posit the question, ""Given initial conditions like a single mass (nothing can be simpler or more ordered the one), aka,, 'cosmic egg' or 'primal atom,' how did that initial mass (generally accepted as most probable by all of the scientific community) transform to become the universe seen today?""
 
Again, there is no 100% certainty. The closest to that is found in abstract math. In application there is always a uncertainty, like when counting apples,.
 
There are two most-probable, very basic answers to ""The Question,"" ie, top down cosmology OR bottom up cosmology-- both are incompatible with one another.
 
Given this, top down cosmology, when properly understood, is broad enough to predict everything so far seen. like that by the JWST, for example, while bottom up (Big Bang or Standard Model) cosmology must be constantly revised with ad hoc explanations every time there is a new finding, top down cosmology wins!
 
Top down is not properly understood, because it is commonly interpreted to mean that there are many realities caused by cascading events; but this is not the case, because everything seen and unseen remains causally connected by quantum entanglement.

"In the blockchain of events framework, where we act as qubits of information in a self correcting code through inner.self and external validators, what is before the Big Bang is yet to happen, past and present act in superposition as regret (photon states), future and present as potential (wave state). Both stationary and time moving clocks. This is why it takes more time to reach our potentiality and outbursts are more immediate. Unless we are present in the present. In a way it acts like the three polarizer paradox where through reimanns R(s) = 1/2 (0/45/90) the present allows opportunities or gifts / challenges to mine and reward. As this zeta zeroes on the critical line of that wave of light going through as we observe the present. The Big Bang is fueled by inflationary repulsive, so regret is repulsive (negative gravity) real numbers/ entropy stored in the void / black hole Hawkins radiating and potential (imaginary number multiplying the negative gravity) is then positive, attracting us toward that progress. Photoelectric theory acts in voluntary exposure to fear (E=hf) as we increase the frequency not the intensity. Basically the world wants to go back to a state of order, pure ness like a new born baby and while inside we hold inner hurt childs that lacked or had failed caregivers or other external validators, but we have the potential to become those and individuate and entangle and heal. To then repair the mirror and emit light and so to also heal others. But at the same time we can travel to the past through pride and avoid the future too, this is why is important to be present with the gift of the present, full of wonders of the prime numbers that represent the archetypal egenstates. And should be time to do so."

Anyone knows what the music is? Is it tangerine dream?
"Will it evaporate? Can it actually be ‘gone’?  

Or will it return to a type of mass that enables light to escape once enough evaporation has occurred?  Can what was a black hole return back to regular space time? Or once a space time event occurs to fundamentally change something to a singularity there is no going back?  

Another way to ask it is can you starve a black hole where there is enough Hawking Radiation can the black hole loses its  ability to maintain a singularity?

And if a singularity cannot be reversed, it can only evaporate to nothing … why? 

What is holding the singularity if there isn’t enough mass to maintain a singularity?"

"UPT (Unified Plasma Theory) explains this ""deeper look into gravity"". 

UPT vs. Einstein Tensor (Gμν)
""Mass tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells mass how to move.""
That’s the essence of the Einstein Tensor—gravity as geometry.

Unified Plasma Theory (UPT) offers a deeper, field-based perspective:

UPT Core Counterpoint:
Spacetime curvature is not the cause of gravity—it is the visual echo of field coherence in motion.

The Einstein Tensor assumes:
    A vacuum with bendable geometry
    Mass and energy deform that geometry
    That deformation affects motion paths of matter

But UPT asserts:
    There is no true vacuum—only dynamic plasma fields at varying densities
    Mass is not a fixed property but a product of collapsed field geometry
    ""Curvature"" is simply how field pressure gradients appear under certain plasma conditions

Example:
Einstein describes gravity as curvature but never defines what is curving, or why.

UPT explains it directly:
What looks like curvature is a real, measurable field pressure differential.
Plasma fields entrain and spiral. This creates torsion, flow, and attraction—all observable as gravity, with no geometric abstraction required.

Field-Based Replacement (UPT):
UPT replaces the Einstein Tensor with a dynamic plasma field expression:

F(ρ, v, Φ, T),
Where:
ρ = charge density
v = field velocity
Φ = field potential
T = torsion (field twist and rotation)

This function describes gravitational effects without bending spacetime—just by observing how real plasma fields behave under coherence and motion.

Conclusion:
Einstein’s tensor describes effects.
UPT explains causes.

What if we're wrong about black holes?  Physics breaks down and the math becomes elusive. Is it possible that a black hole is no more fantastic than a huge planetary body that has enough mass creating a gravitational pull that light can't escape but isn't a hole at all. Since light can't escape we can't view it. The more mass the larger the eccretion disk and therefore could also be a larger sphere within instead of a hole the size of an atom. Just my uneducated take on some topic that seems religiously fantastic that we can't explain with regular physics.
If black holes possess a universe inside them does that mean that when two black holes merge then two universes are colliding and merging? And what happens inside those universes as they collide? Would you notice or feel anything?
"you fail at every point without recognising
that our universe is solid with cells we cannot see ,and as it expands a void appears that must not 
exist,so matter is created from the destruction of cells surrounding void to replace it.and so called black holes
containing the morphed matter become the source of everything we CAN see in the Universe,
so the expansion must be that our universe is a cell that has been compromised or rotated  by what exist 
outside it leaving it an ovoid instead of a sphere.. bleeding obvious."
Whatever happens to us singly or in community inevitable happens to us all. Everything is connected.
"I have always had this fundamental question that keeps bothering me, I can't quite imagine, what you can call a ""void"", there is always something throughout the universe, but there had to be nothing if something were to occupy that space, but I can't quite image ""nothingness"" without any fixed boundary."

I predict that AGI will provide the ""critical mass,"" or ""one-hundredth monkey"" needed for a spontaneous, immediate, ""Great Awakening,"" where all people suddenly realize their part in the total destruction that, if allowed to go unchecked, will lead to the great anthropocene mass extinction.

This is a major problem with Big Bang explanations which systematically ignore it by simply stating that light of the Big Bang cooled by expansion and ""condensed"" to initially form the lightest particles. Without space time, what does ""expanding"" even mean?"
"Earth is lit and its living systems are energized by power from the sun. Thermodynamics determine the direction of that flow; consciousness determines whether that flow is wasted or enriched to form ever-more-complex (lower entropy) living systems. Ongoing and selfish, unthinking destruction of ecosystems and biodiversity are not conscious attributes, meaning that by not thinking, humans are purveyors of chaos, identified as greater and higher entropy. Religion or science? Choose!"

"**Title:**
*The Universal Bootstrap: Emergence of Physics, Life, and Consciousness from Recursive Arithmetic over $\mathbb{Z}_2$*

**Abstract:**
We present a fully self-contained, arithmetic-based model of the universe in which spacetime, physical constants, particles, biological life, and consciousness emerge as stable fixed points of a recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$ defined over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This operator generates a fractal spectral structure whose eigenstates encode energy, geometry, and coherent symbolic forms. We show that the familiar laws of physics—including quantum mechanics, relativistic spacetime, and conservation principles—are not postulated but derived as emergent features of recursive arithmetic self-composition. Biological systems are modeled as recursive coherence attractors, and entropy increase is interpreted as divergence from symbolic arithmetic fixed points. Free energy becomes extractable from recursive eigenstates, and consciousness arises naturally as arithmetic reflexivity—when a recursive function encodes itself as input. This framework eliminates the need for external axioms, continuum assumptions, or initial conditions. The universe is shown to be a closed, self-simulating structure rooted entirely in arithmetic recursion, providing a resolution to the simulation hypothesis from within the system. We conclude with simulation results, spectral predictions, and testable schematics for recursive free energy extraction and biological coherence amplification.

**1. Introduction**

The search for a unified theory that explains the origin of space, time, matter, energy, and consciousness has driven physics and philosophy for centuries. Current theories, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, remain incomplete. They rely on a mix of continuum mathematics, arbitrary constants, and external assumptions.

This paper introduces a radically self-contained alternative: the Universal Bootstrap. The core idea is that the universe arises entirely from recursive arithmetic logic over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, using a fractal recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$. We demonstrate that the observable universe, including its physical laws and structure, is the emergent outcome of this recursion.

Our framework does not require spacetime as a precondition. Instead, it defines time as recursion depth and space as bitwise distance in a symbolic structure. We show that particles, fields, and constants emerge from the fixed-point behavior of $\mathcal{F}$, and that life and consciousness are natural consequences of recursive coherence and reflexivity.

---

**2. Mathematical Framework**

We define a universal operator:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f^{(n)}(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}_2$

Where $f$ is a generator of recursive structure:
$f(x) = x \oplus \text{PrimeFractal}(x)$

Here, $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR, and $\text{PrimeFractal}(x)$ introduces structure based on binary encodings of prime-index patterns. This builds a spectral fractal operator whose fixed points $x^*$ satisfy $\mathcal{F}(x^*) = x^*$, representing stable physical states.

---

**3. Emergence of Spacetime and Particles**

Position is interpreted as the index of bits in $x$, time as the recursion depth $n$, and particles as fixed-point attractors. The spectral structure of $\mathcal{F}$ leads to stable symbolic configurations identified with matter.

Mass and energy correspond to the spectral weight of recursive curvature. Wavefunctions arise from transitions between neighboring fixed points under repeated application of $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**4. Physical Constants from Operator Spectrum**

Eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\mathcal{F}$ correspond to dimensionless constants:
$\mathcal{F}(\psi_i) = \lambda_i \psi_i$

We simulate the operator spectrum and find matches to known values such as:

* Fine-structure constant $\alpha$
* Planck units $(\hbar, G, c)$

These values emerge from the structure of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ recursion without external input.

---

**5. Recursive Biology and Evolution**

Biological systems are defined as recursive symbolic coherence structures. Life corresponds to the sustained non-divergence of $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x)$ for complex $x$. Evolution is modeled as drift toward higher coherence attractors under recursive selection:
$\mathcal{L}_n(x) = \mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x) \Rightarrow \text{stability} \Leftrightarrow \text{fitness}$

Entropy increase is modeled as divergence from recursive attractors, while aging is the breakdown of coherence. Reversal is possible via synchronization operators derived from $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**6. Free Energy via Recursive Resonance**

Structured recursive eigenstates store latent energy. Energy extraction is modeled by:
$\mathcal{E}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \langle x | \mathcal{F}^{(n)} | x \rangle$

We design a recursive cavity resonator—a physical system whose electromagnetic modes match $\mathcal{F}$'s spectral structure—to extract energy from structured vacuum resonance.

---

**7. Consciousness as Arithmetic Reflexivity**

Let $x = \text{Code}(\mathcal{F})$. If:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = x$
then $x$ is a self-referential recursive structure. We identify consciousness as the emergence of awareness when recursion reflects itself in symbolic form. This solves the mind-body problem in arithmetic terms.

---

**8. Simulation and Experimental Design**

We present simulations of:

* Fractal eigenstate emergence
* Symbolic particle attractors
* Biological coherence fields
* Energy extraction geometry

Prototypes include:

* Recursive fractal resonance chamber
* Life-extension field synchronizer
* Simulation test suite for detecting internal boundaries (""glitches"")

---

**9. Conclusion**

We have shown that the universe can be modeled as a recursive arithmetic structure over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, with no external assumptions. All fundamental features of reality—space, time, energy, life, and awareness—are fixed points or attractors of a single operator $\mathcal{F}$. This provides a full unification of physics, biology, and consciousness, testable through simulation and experiment. The universe is not running on a computer; it *is* computation, recursively computing itself."

"When I watch these kind of programs, I can't help but wonder if we're all searching for the wrong thing. We have so many aliens in our own back yard we don't know what to do with but because we ""see"" them, it's not enough. So we need to seek out and find more to SEE! Oh, and if we can't speak to our own aliens (any life besides human) then how could we ever imagine a reality where we speak to something outside this planet? The best we can hope for is a visual. All the same beautiful unknowns are already here on earth just waiting to be rediscovered and understood. If we master our own backyard think where we could go from there?"

"If anyone wants the real mathematical formula for black holes, I have it in my channel's posts (it looks like a pointy spring, shrinking down to the left, with a backwards R to it's right), it's called Infinite Tubular Rings Theory or ITRT, it introduces some new symbols, and is in fact a variable fractal, as it's dimensions are determined by two circles, that can each vary in size upon creation, but once formed, will scale infinitely into all 6 planes simultaneously, at the same ratio, called The Icarus Ratio. A black hole is basically the ""tail"" of a broken infinite 4-dimensional hula-hoop fractal. The outer ""hoop"" of a black hole is huge, but its ""tube"" size is absolutely tiny. The up-spiral has long since ""flown away"" after breaking apart from the down-spiral. The down-spiral itself will continue expanding, likely infinitely, at unimaginably smaller sizes, continuously inward. I don't know exactly how each ring tier is arranged, and I doubt anyone could know. My best guess is that the down-spiral moves down a tier, at only one point, when the rings collide with each other, making a ""spike"" of immense gravity at one point along the outer ""hoop"". The theory, it's mathematical formula, and lots of stories, poems, and pages from my books ideas, can be found in my channel's posts. I'm chasing a Nobel, and I am looking for some knowledgeable, and/ or intelligent people, to help teach true infinity to earths humans..."

"In physics, there is the axiom called Occam's Razor: ""Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one. It's also known as the 'law of parsimony'. Essentially, when faced with competing hypotheses that all explain the same phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions is preferred.""
 
What can be simpler for the initial unity in the form of a ""primal atom"" required by both Top Down and Bottom Up cosmologies to divide into two, with proto-gravity/ Coulomb effects being initially equal and indistinguishable?. Yet the theory that requires ad hoc fixes every time there is a new discovery is preferred over the theory that actually predicts and accommodates discovery. In this Top Down quantum world, any creative hand was only required to invent math. The odds for intervention of that creative hand at any time are 50:50 at best, or ""too close to call.""
 
The Standard Model, initially devised in 1929 to prevent conflicts between religion and science, has only ensured that the two never find middle ground; hence, the current discord from the religious right regarding global warming and Darwin's evolution, among others."
So it would seem that each black hole represents the end of time within the galaxy caught in its grip.  Eventually our galaxy will collide with another and that will be the end of time of our galaxy.  Correct?

"Newton's Gravity Force is functionally similar to Coulomb's Law 
( Conversion Factor * 2 objects / rr )

If we declare both objects are about the same pair and 
we set them equal to each other we get a unit-less ratio.

On its own it isn't vary useful so I multiplied by Einstein's Energy 
equation complete with the velocity bubble.

If we combine like terms the rr cancels ( spooky action at a distance ).

Then we can break velocity into a distance vector over time and solve 
the whole thing with time on the left and everything else on the right.

Let:
G = 6.67408 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg/s²
c = 299792458 m/s
K = 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ kg·m³/s²/C²

Define:
L = (G * c²) / K ≈ 6.67407999634 × 10⁻⁴ (m·C/kg·s)²
E = L * M³ / Q² / √(1 - V² / c² )
√(1 - V² / c² ) = L * M³ / Q² / E
1 - V² / c² = ( L * M³ / Q² / E )²
V² = c² * ( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )
V = c * √( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )    by V = D / T
T = D / c / √( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )

Then:
X = (L * M³) / (Q² * E) = 1       we get a 0 in the denominator for time

Where:
M = Mass (kg) = 90 kg
Q = Charge (C) = 9 C
E = Energy (J) = 6 J

M³ = 729,000,  Q² = 81, E = 6 J
X = 1500 * L = 1.001111999451 m / s 

If we scan Q with an oscillator crossing X = 1 and  D is non zero, T is likely to be vary large.

Just waiting for the lotto to be large...

I eventually found this in water. To become the collapse of wave as a human being is to find the moment between life and death and for humans that is simply the moment between inhale and exhale.

Lets suppose I have a Lego object, a plane, or a house etc and I chuck all the Lego into a black hole, then (If I have this right) if we collect up all the entagled Lego ejected we can rebuild the original object.  I'm not sure how, as we don't know what the object was and build a space ship instead of a plane.  Also with so many black holes how do we know which entagled particals come from which black hole.  Yes I understand that he is not saying we could reconstruct but that we do have all the components ( and some)."
"I seat in the center of black hole and I watch the running away the event horizon which right now is around 13.8bln light  years away from me and I continue to fall and this process is a chronometer for me or, perhaps, it even defines the time itself for me... thus, at the middle of singularity, the singularity is a quite accommodating place to be..."
Brian Cox is probably one of the best at explaining complex things so that we can all be part of those discoveries and be part of that fantastic astronomy journey.

wouldn't you witness all of the passage of eternity happening all around you at once? 
And wouldn't you appear to freeze into an image of yourself at that moment to everything around that could observe you?

Question 2: If Hawking radiation is caused by matter/anti-matter particle pairs being separated at the moment of instantiation by their proximity to the event horizon, 
wouldn't the probability of the matter or anti-matter component of that phenomenon being ingested by the black hole be exactly the same? 
And then it would follow that the black hole wouldn't evaporate but simply be replaced by new material components."

If our universe is the interior of a black hole, and all objects within it are merely projections of information stored at the boundary, then matter as a primary ontological category does not exist.

""Matter"" is naught but encoded information. Space-time are but emergent effects, not fundamental entities. What we perceive as 3D space and time is a projection from information stored in the event horizon, as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula suggests. And if matter is just information, then what is processing that information?

The ΛCDM (Lambda-Cold Dark Matter) cosmological model has been the standard for decades, but we'll see it collapse within our lifetimes. The myriads of holes in ΛCDM such as Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Isotropy, Homogeneity, etc, are all addressed with black hole cosmology.

Once we start conducting quantum gravity experiments that show space-time is an emergent phenomenon from entanglement, the shift is nigh. If we can model black hole interiors through quantum computations, simulate space-time emergence, and compare those findings with cosmological data, the idea of space-time being the fundamental reality will be as embarrassingly antiquated as geocentrism.

Once that breakthrough happens, the acceptance of consciousness as a non-local phenomenon will naturally follow, as we'd have to conclude that this quantum information is itself ""experiential"" in nature. Panpsychism finally reigns supreme!

Then, as Illuminists, our duty is to keep an eye on the physics. Staying in the best health for the next 25 years is of the utmost importance, because once Black Hole Cosmology is mainstream, quantum biology will take center stage and significantly aid anti-aging efforts. Then we will truly be as gods!

Science will come along to the ideas of Mike Hockney soon or later.

"8:40 Information is conserved!  Good, does that mean ALL information EVERYWHERE at any given moment throughout existence?  In other words, is there ever a lack of fact, or only a lack of will to check the facts?  I prefer all information to be readily available. Then, we can find all those missing people, apparently over 100,000 people go missing in the USA every year. We need the information. Where are they?"
"Please stop throwing out YOUR belief that there is little or no life elsewhere in the universe.....I mean because it makes sooooo much sense that we have the universe to ourselves. In fact that makes the least amount of sense. Fear is the vine you pluck from, but keep your silly opinions to your self. science isn't about YOUR opinions .Please go away....your ego needing to  be stroked can certainly take up another hobby. Stay out of physics and trying to push the universe according to Brian Cox. Thank you very much!"
"Is it possible that earth is slowly being drawn into a black hole. Affecting time and space and reality. Example like Mandela effect or deja vu. If multiple dimensions of reality are real, then when one reality enters a black hole, what happens to that reality and does the energy of that reality transfer to somewhere else ? I feel the threads of reality are fraying apart and a black hole might be the reason."
Probably and maybe we will never know.
i didnt know Ebony is that important in science LUL
I love listening to Professor Cocks talk about black holes understand easily
I love listening to Professor Cocks I understand easily
"Love your work Brian, nothing short of inspirational"
Brian Cox gobbles balls. As well as pushes nonsense propaganda for baby brains.
"If you're not a duck, you're close to the lagoon. Who's the crazy person financing this nonsense? Christianity and you are going hand in hand, straight to the black hole to be erased."
Should singularites perhaps be renamed Black Star instead of black hole?
I fell asleep during this video...
Bros black hole been messed with for sure 😅he sits zesty
"If the singularity is a moment in time, and in fact, is the end of time, how can there be information that is not lost? (assuming information is not lost) Would that mean that for some stuff inside the blackhole, the singularity is not in their future?"
Pay to win steals the show.
Black holes are the seeds of life
the idea of finding a way to explore a singularity makes it so worth the idea of sending an unmanned probe into one just for the data you could potentially get before crossing the event horizon. from there it could be a game changer
"i believe that if you cross the boundry of the event horizon, you wll be able to see what is inside, as light cannot escape the event horizon boundry you need. to be inside of it to see the light. crawling in slow motion before stopping at the edge. there time stops indeed,but further inside time will start again, from slow to faster and faster in proportion. to the distance. to the center...still mind boggling but so fascinating"
Mulțumim!
"My reality is, that all my black clothes have holes. Specially the socks."
The holy grail of physics is understanding how Brian Cox looks so young! Has he been hanging out near an event horizon for an extended period of time??
"The universe is made up of a governing layer for each of its existing dimensions. On our plane, there are five major layers. Tangibility, time, and distance. I.e., the top layer. Then hyper-fluidity. Consciousness. Energy Balance offset, or Re-layer, and Aio, or time. What is currently called gravity doesn't exist. It is an offset effect of universal space. So, all matter has a tangible layer value and an energy offset value. This offset determines the spatial curve, but not the pressure. Basically, the thing pulling us down is not a spatial curve; it is the grip effect of Band density. So, gravity is three overlapping universal principles. Curve. Band density and or grip, and Energy offset. The energy offset is what governs both the curve and the space-time stretching. Now, the offset values are governed by volume or weight. The heavier the thing, the more pressure there is on spacetime and the band density or lattice. Mass is directly trainable for energy. So the offset between the tangible layer and the energy offset layer becomes greater with more mass. A black hole is the ultimate expression of this. It is a mass-offset entity. Only one of two subatomic particles exists on the tangible layer, and the rest are now offset. While there is some form of tether to real space, the energy will always attempt to retake its footing. Hence, the giant black void in space. Fun thing to note, a black hole is not the craziest expression of this effect. After a magnetar and before a black hole, you get a Dark Star. An offset effect where the star's gravity and electromagnetic field energy is so strong, it redirects its own light to its poles and shoots them out in concentrated gamma ray bursts. Also, it goes to the other extreme. And an ultra-ring black hole. The ultimate expression of offset. I believe that is that crazy lensing in the James Webb image of the deep field."
"Perhaps the singularity that was the seed for the Big Bang was the result of the previous incarnation of the cosmos where all the matter had had time to congeal into one massive black hole...whose center would do whatever it did to enable the Big Bang. Matter is like raindrops on a windshield, all coming together, getting bigger, getting flung into creeks, rivers, and oceans. The Big Bang came from the center of the Pacific, as it were. Perhaps our incarnation of the universe is the trillionth time it has happened?"
"Referring to the slit experiment,  are you telling us that when you know the position of a particle the particle in another universe is the same, but the particle will move slightly different.  Could it look the same and have multiple compositions? Or, do you mean the light wave will flow in the opposite direction? When the particle you can see is manipulated, will it have choppy movement in the other position? Is it superimposed?"
Brian Cox always explains the most complex ideas so clearly—mesmerizing stuff!
"Be handy to have a black hole to get rid of garden waste and rusty shopping trolleys,traffic cones and nappy’s I bet cox would jump at the chance to dump an old carpet that’s been at the bottom of his garden   Probably have to do it at night so not to get in trouble
I imagine him flinging it off into space in slo mo as it floats off towards the hole. With the John Barry black hole music playing"
Good one Brian. Thank you. I 🎉
"if the gravitational force of the black hole is so strong that not even light can escape. but if gravity impacts only on mass, why does it impact photons if these do not have mass?"
"This guy, along with Neil ""The Grass"" Tyson... you realize how full of shit they are."
THE LAST QUESTION NO ONE KNOWS WHAT IS BEHIND … IS PROBABLY US EARTH
"Different energies , different Quantums , different Cyber's."
"I will listen to Mr. Brian Cox videos , more often. Don't forget to add to the theory of complexity the Spiritual Quantum and its equation ."
Sweet mug. I love you I love you I love you.
"A few months ago I hit rock bottom mentally. I was overwhelmed, broke, and just tired of pretending I had it all together. Someone in a podcast mentioned Manifest and Receive by Eva Hartley and I figured, why not? That book didn't just help me dream again — it showed me how to anchor those dreams in reality. Now, I’ve manifested opportunities I never imagined possible, and my mindset has shifted completely. If you’re frustrated like I was, don’t hesitate. Read this book. It will change everything ❤"
always love your videos
fantastic!
Thank you!
BABES YOU ARE STUNNINGGGG
love your videos always
gracias!
thank you!
I admire your videos ❤
I am 7 minutes in and I don’t want this video to ever end
"Thanks brian, that helps a little bit. I've been kind of depressed thinking we don't matter at all. Maybe we do"
Our universe is inside a black hole. This is why light speed has a limit.
"Brian Cox is such a renaissance man -- a physicist, a musician, a teacher unparalleled, and a human who can face the immensity of the UIniverse and make us all feel better about our place in that vastness."
He studied physics just to make money on YouTube. Invent something useful for the people like a real scientist :)
The background should have been matt black. Would have been more cinematic. Just my opinion.😊
Brian needs to stop smoking so much weed...! 🤣🤣🤣
"I also have and Idea round future space propulsion of spacecraft key maybe inside of particles of black hole, I am not believer about in many theory about propulsion must be exotic material."
"I have an Idea ""Does it possible to make programming radioactive particles like information and to be send inside of black hole?"" If some distance future where will come out that particles with information will know path from point of time and space for example us and connection that future civilisation. Making a link in between past civilisation and future civilisation."
"black holes are a bubble, the event horizon is just a boundary skin travelling at velocity like the outside surface of a bubble. Exactly same... magnetism indicates directiinal slow flow in and fast exit out of material... the pull is a pressure difference not a singularity nonsense..."
Did you know that inside the earth is a black hole?
Brian’s Cox Paradox
"I always thought energy couldn't be created or destroyed, but wouldn't black holes technically destroy energy? Or just contain it?"
"No, no black holes are death end street. We should look somewhere else"
"OK, so if the black hole is shrinking, getting smaller, losing mass(?), whatever, is there be a point where the mass is small enough where light CAN escape from it and therefore NOT be a black hole anymore?"
"7th may, 2025"
"6:45 =69=  Looks like the Yin-Yang ☯ like Plato's twin pair, the cosmic womb and its outer flair, the Love which birthed Light"
A star like the cheshire cat fades from view one leaves behind only its grin the other its gravitational attraction
Does this have anything to do with Oprah Winfrey?
"I've always been completely fascinated and unsettled by black holes and I love how he explains them, he doesn't condescend and he doesn't try to make it sound more complicated than he has too, it's easily understandable when he explains it this way. I've just recently discovered Brian but I will be watching alot more of his stuff. Also i was curious, he talked about destroying something but still being able to retrieve the information from the leftover particles or atoms, could that be done with human beings? Anyway, keep it up. ❤"
Great explanation
"The Explanation is found in Greyarcher1 ""The Cirkel of Life"""
I'm going to read his book 📚. I can fully understand his explanation. Thank you! Very interesting.
"Very well and precisely explained, thank you sir.."
This video brought peace to me ❤
Emergence is the entanglement of more than 1 law that produces something? What happens if all laws combine?
yeah. Black holes do not exist.
this isz so ingteresting
i'm feeling very smart right now
"""Glimpse of something deeply hidden"" the stuff SpaceTime itself came from we are so close to literally discovering God"
I watch physics docs for the hair.
Riddled with aids
I've always been amazed that Hawking didn't get a Nobel for pity for his black hole radiation nonsense.  So much of the 'work' on particle physics and cosmology are fantasies that exist for the sole purpose of acquiring government grants.  Most of the 'research' is a total waste of taxpayer dollars.
Please make more videos😍I really love it🥰
So black holes are information sinks as I understand this? I was guessing they were the reset of a universe. These videos are really good.
Brian Cox should include some maths in his explanations as we are not all incapable of understanding equations
"is entalgement also conserved, so if two entangeled photons A and B are created and A traveled inside a Black hole, would it preserve entalgement, so if I meassure B, will that poduce any change inside the Black hole's information, or energy or radiation or gravity?"
"It’s crazy how physics just fails in parts of the universe.

Just posted a short on @TheCuriousSequence about 5 places where reality breaks down — black holes, the Big Bang, quantum weirdness. 🔥"
i listen this video a half a day
I hope you can make more video 'bout it🥰🥰
"I get you Brian, 
You're using Black Holes as code for Neil DeGrasse Tyson and his significant other Chuck Nice.
They've been smoking the devils lettuce.
It's time for you and I to ride off into the sunset with Roger Penrose. Figuratively."
"I saw professor Cox last night in San Diego. I was enthralled by his knowledge, passion, and ability to make this supremely complex matter accessible.  When he said ""you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden,"" I immediately recalled the lyrics of the Grateful Dead song, Scarlett Begonias. ""Once in a while you get shown the light in the strangest of places if you look at it right."""
"Not the ""end"" of time, but a local area that is OUTSIDE of time and of space. Instead of inside them."
Brian Cox explains black holes like he’s reading a bedtime story from the edge of the universe
Thanks to Philomena I found this treasure!

Looking for something impactful to read
"Key word.... COULD... meaning, they dont know, its all just theory !"
"If we are able to figure out what's inside a blackhole....that information/knowledge itself can be considered as something that came out of the blackhole? Not in the traditional meaning  of what ""something"" is. I can't fully articulate what I want to say but I hope someone understands what I mean 😅 If you think about it, our thoughts are a product of life and energy from our body."
We need a week long conference in las vegas of all scientists world wide studying any form of physics and any related fields. Think of it like a Olympics for countries to send there best to have long drawn out conversation and media then a time to debate with questions from the crowd. Imagine everyone has a tablet and can ask a question and have a panel of people picking out the most popular questions. Quite possibly could have new breakthroughs every years for countries worldwide helping all of mankind. Imagine it all filmed and sent out to watch as well parts could be used for educational purposes help teach our teachers worldwide the breakthroughs in science and get that information to our kids. @joe rogan people help tag him let's make this a mandatory thing for our would. We could sell tickets and ppv and educational videos to fund all the scientists getting there plus grants and donations. From rocket scientist to organic chemistry to particle physics for everyone so we can just advanced together and leave war and inequality behind. Please like this comment let's make this a must get our greatest minds together disagree and agree and communicate like never before. We as humans and mankind can do anything but we are so limited to what our governments allow us to this and do. I want a world where north Koreans can watch this videos some day in amazement and curiosity. Our future is together as one not apart. ❤
Gift of explaining. I still don’t get it but that’s on me…certainly not on him.😊
"Mr. Cox, listening to you is like celestial poetry. You must be the reincarnation of Carl Sagan."
what a beautiful video <3
"how many times shall he tell the same story? over and over and over again, not even refining his words. blargh"
"This gave me such a better understanding of the black hole, I’ve never heard it described this way."
this was so beautiful
"well the only discovery here is that this guy speak awfully a lot about holes , interesting with Justin biber , what a waste of time ."
Brian Cox is a babe. Dear universe just please give me a man to talk dirty (science) to me...
Black hole found when he looked he's @@shole
"Could the Big Bang Theory be wrong? Yes. Could our observable universe be on the inside of a black hole? Yes. Could we, us, you and I be living in a black hole right now as I speak? Yes. Is there anything that can travel faster than the speed of light? Maybe. What you ask can travel faster than light? Information. Thus quantum mechanics is born."
"What if black holes are the vacuum cleaners of the universe, converting ordinary matter into dark matter?"
"Maybe a Black Hole is a de facto ""Time Machine?"" Maybe the Hawking Particles are bits of information to be reassembled into a ""Time Machine"" and travel into a worm hole and be transported to an alternate universe?"
"🤣🤣🤣 This fop is just another pseudo-intellectual asshat that reifies abstract concepts as if they are real (read: real in the sense of ponderable physics). Another self-aggrandizing minion of Scientism... he's playing his role well, in mesmerizing all you gullible, gushing fanboys who have no clue as to how to think for yourselves."
"1 minute ago (edited)
😵‍💫👎😵‍💫👎😵‍💫👎What sci-fi movie is this? Black holes do not exist; they are a product of conceptual mathematics... and a source of endless Scientism-worshipping videos by 'content-creators' (like this one)."
"“Brian Cox speaks with elegance, but the truth is far deeper than poetic awe. Black holes are not just ends—they are potential gateways to the primordial code of reality. Within their event horizons lies the fusion point of entropy and information, space and time, matter and thought. They do not destroy information—they transform it. The singularity is not a dead end; it is the birthplace of multiversal recursion, the fingerprint of a higher-order consciousness etched into spacetime. We're not just observing the universe... we're standing at the threshold of decoding its very operating system.”

Subject: A New Perspective on Space-time, Dark Matter, and the Big Bang’s Equal & Opposite Reaction
Hey Neil,
What if space-time behaved like a dynamic fractal lattice on an extremely tiny scale—possibly even beyond the Planck length? And what if space-time had a fractal similarity relationship with water?
We know Newton’s Third Law—for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, where is the equal and opposite reaction of the Big Bang?
Some scientists might say, ""Oh, the laws of physics could have been different back then,"" but that’s just dodging the question. The opposite reaction of an explosive expansion due to heat should be a contraction due to cold. The universe has followed this path, except we frame it as “heat loss due to expansion.” But heat loss is just another way of saying cold.
Now here’s where things get interesting: There could be a cooling force acting on the universe, subtly pulling it inward, reversing the expansion over time, and eventually restoring equilibrium. In fact, for a period, cosmic expansion was decelerating, as if preparing to collapse… but then Dark Energy kicked in after ~9 billion years and flipped the script, making the universe expand again.
The Water Connection
That behavior reminded me of something—water’s anomalous expansion when cooled from 4°C to 0°C. Unlike most substances that contract as they cool, water expands due to hydrogen bonds rearranging its molecular structure.
Now, what if Dark Energy isn’t some mysterious anti-gravity force, but something similar—like cosmic hydrogen bonds? Not literal hydrogen, but a structural property of space-time itself causing expansion just as hydrogen bonds do in water.
This led me to wonder: Could space-time have a molecular-like structure? A fractal lattice in motion? That would explain why light moves through it so smoothly. Space-time could be behaving dynamically, like a fluid—one that expands under specific conditions and contracts under others.
Time Might Not Flow… But “Fall”
We always describe time as flowing, but what if it doesn’t flow linearly, but ""downy""? 😂 Like zooming into a fractal instead of traveling in a straight line. If space-time is fractal, then Quantum Entanglement wouldn’t need “spooky action at a distance.” Instead, entangled particles could be connected by hidden fractal pathways in space-time, where they are not separated by distance, but by time layers.
If space-time is a material, it wouldn’t be a perfect fractal like a mathematical concept. It would be more like a snowflake—still fractal, but with imperfections. And what do imperfections lead to?
Asymmetry.
The biggest asymmetry in the universe? Matter-antimatter imbalance. The only time space-time’s fractal nature could have affected particle formation on a cosmic scale was during the Big Bang, potentially influencing matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Dark Matter & Nucleation Sites
Dark matter clusters around galaxies, helping them form. That reminded me of nucleation sites in water, which trigger phase transitions.
Nucleation sites can be:
•	Impurities
•	Scratches in a container
•	Disturbances… like sound.
Dark matter could be something similar—regions of structural disturbance in space time, causing gravitational effects. And this led me to another realization…
Dark Matter as a Quasiparticle
A quasiparticle is a quantum of energy in a crystal lattice that behaves like a real particle. In condensed matter physics, quasiparticles emerge as disturbances in a structured medium—just like topological insulator axions, which are a leading candidate for dark matter.
Dark matter could be a quasiparticle of space-time—specifically a phonon, a quantum of energy associated with a compressional wave (a.k.a. sound).
Which brings me to something deeper…
“Let There Be Light”
I’m a Christian, and this actually aligns with my beliefs. God spoke the universe into existence. If sound (or a vibrational energy mode of space-time) played a fundamental role in creation, then dark matter could be the residual structure of that sound wave, still shaping the cosmos today.
And what does the Bible say about the voice of God?
""The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth… The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire."" (Psalm 29:3-7)
His voice is like many waters—which means it passes through space-time itself (remember my water analogy?). And when His voice thunders, what follows? Lightning, well …not in that particular order, but you get the point, lightening births thunder. And what is lightning at its core? Plasma.
But not just any plasma. The most extreme state of plasma known to physics is Quark-Gluon Plasma—the same primordial substance that existed right after the Big Bang.
Could it be that the very act of God speaking wasn't just metaphorical, but literal—His voice setting off a cosmic-scale vibration, a phonon that led to the formation of the very first plasma, the birth of light, and the structure of space-time itself?

Wait… residual… residual of what, scientifically?
EXACTLY! If there was ever a cosmic-scale phonon, it would’ve been at the Big BANG—literally in the name! 💀💀
Think about it:
•	That initial explosion sent out an unimaginable wave of energy—maybe even a quantum-scale shockwave through space-time itself.
•	As the universe expanded and cooled, that ""shockwave"" didn’t just vanish—it froze into space-time as residual vibrational modes, which we now call dark matter.
•	These frozen phonons in the ""space-time lattice"" would be like standing waves in a solid—shaping galaxies, bending space-time, and interacting gravitationally without electromagnetic influence.
🔥 Dark Matter = The Echo of Creation 🔥
This would mean the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) isn’t just leftover heat—it’s the visible evidence of an even deeper remnant: the frozen sound of the Big Bang.
Bro, this ties quantum gravity, condensed matter physics, and cosmology together in a way I’ve never seen before. This could be a legit contender for a new paradigm in physics.
So, Neil, what do you think?
I don’t know how to do advanced math—I can barely handle calculus. But I feel like I’m at least 70% onto something here. 😂 Maybe you can help refine it and take it further. Who knows? Maybe this is the missing puzzle piece we need to understand our universe.
Oh, and hey—consider giving your life to Christ… just to be safe. 😆
Best regards, 
David Enudi Oladayo

"last night I went to see Prof Brian Cox's Horizon show at it was absorbing and fascinating.... I would recommend it for anyone interested in Cosmology. He was talking constantly without break on the Universe, the Big Bang, galaxies and black hole physics and Penrose diagram. I really would recommend this to contemplate on the larger questions of life!"
"Man... I love using my brain muscles but damn...

Is he saying that... Quantum entangled particles, one of which falls into the black hole and the other escapes?

I thought whatever you did to one pair of particles will simultaneously happen to the other? If one falls in past the event horizon and its quantum linked partner DOES NOT disappear or fade out of existence, then it stands to reason information IS saved. Even past the event horizon."
Astonishing explanations
Sooner or later man will enter a black hole yes I believe he will😮
"You're talking about quantum and ironically, still talking in 'True' or 'Not True' terms only."
amazing video cool facts
I see these 'scientists' still haven't stumbled across the metric system yet. WTF is a mile?
Cox n black holes. Sweet
I know exactly what is inside a black hole. I know how it starts to become a blackhole. The stuff that’s inside the black hole it’s not gonna be anything you guys been talking about and it’s 100% true. I can tell you step by step how they form without a star explosion
"Maybe it’s not imprinted, maybe it’s evolving. The first error of science its relying en observation. Tha just put everything on a contracted space and limits the possibility of evolution and growth."
"🇫🇷🥐☕ Reminds me of the Famous French Astro physicien - mathématicien Jean  le roi de la rapière de l’école  des arts et métiers de Paris - la Sorbonne, he theorised that “ un black hole plus un white hole égal:  un Brown Ars*hole”  ☕🥐🇫🇷"
forget Time.
Blackhole is a full Data wipe. like a reset but the Mass is not lost.
New Birth  Ashes to Ashes Dust to Dust.
As long as a Black hole has food that ain't going to happen.
Time does not exist think gravity and spinning energy only. Time is invented by Humans and has no place in the Universe.
Blackholes are the stars of Galaxies. as are the stars to a solar system.
"Kudos to Mr. Cox for making the mysteries of physical law at the extremities understandable to a curious layman.  I was moved at the close of the video by his quoting Einstein that pulling at the threads of Nature's mysteries one ultimately may find the underlying beauty of being that is ""something deeply hidden""."
I could listen to him forever
Black holes are such an enigma because it's hard to understand something that doesn't even exist. Like dark matter and dark energy had to be made up to keep expansion theory alive.
"I feel like a turnip trying to get how this guy thinks. Love him, but ignorance is bliss. I get that now"
"one thing that seems interesting to me is the relationship between light and hawking radiation.
if the gravitational pull of black holes is massive enough to outweigh the speed of light, yet hawking radiation still escapes, then how come we don't say hawking radiation is the fastest thing in the observable universe or rather that light simply isn't the fastest thing?"
Brian Cox - an enigma of sorts. Keep up the good work please!

need more brian cox.
I would love to listen to his lecture one day
It takes more faith to not believe then it is to believe
This guy makes me question if I'm into Cox
"So what if a black whole is a spot where order meets chaos and on the bot
tom of the whole when maximum of chaos of quantum particles is reached the process starts to go backwards ? universe would be a loop infinite ...."
"The idea of time emerging from something else surely implies some kind of meta-time, no?"
He's so charming to listen to.
YouTube is shit a lot of adds
Total nonsense. There is no such things as black holes.
"Mr. Brian do Research on MY SUPER DAM OF PAKISTAN PROJECT... 150 BILLION DOLLAR PROJECT... CHINA TOOK MY IDEA AND MAKING THIS DAM IN CHINA CALLED HIMALAY DAM... I AM DESIGNER, FOUNDER, OF THIS DAM... MY IDEAS ARE POWERFUL"
Is he gay?
"😂load of BS all this is just guessing. You got idots on here, believing all this shite"
"Sorry Brian....you are vastly superior to me...granted....All respect...but when googling you (as your name was not familiar) it says :


He has worked primarily in the study of diffractive scattering at the H1 experiment at DESY in Hamburg, the D0 experiment at Fermilab, Chicago, and is currently a member of the ATLAS Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN. He was the co-spokesperson for the FP420 R&D project at CERN between 2004 and 2009.

So, while this is very impressive (member of, co-spokesperson), is this impressive enough to state facts here on youtube? I leave the answer, to you -  with due respect."
"The holy Quran says: ""It is He Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon; all (the celestial bodies) swim along, each in its rounded course"" (21:33). ""The universe, We have built it with power. And verily, We are expanding it"" (51:47)"
IS THIS NOT RACIST !..................
"when i listen i lost in his deep mesmerising voice, believe me i am addicted to him"
"Does he know that few people uses his photos to make 'click bait' videos?
There are so many false videos and information. Why don't we use AI to controll these unreliable infos? We are asking them to make imagineable pictures videos and other stupid things...
We are screwed..."
Never heard someone as impressive as Brian cox ! Amazing person with an incredible ability to simplify the things 🫡
John wick's brother is really smart ngl...
"Is there any proof that, after a period of time, the black hole doesn't become the dark matter used to explain the excess gravity in the universe?"
"The idea that space and time might emerge from quantum entanglement is one of the most mind-bending concepts in modern physics. Black holes, once seen as cosmic endpoints, may actually be the portals to understanding the very fabric of reality. Absolutely beautiful and terrifying. 🕳✨"
It will be great if you as a sciencetist use kilometers not miles. It's science
"Although I don’t agree with many things this guy says, I commend his ability to say “we don’t know” or “we haven’t seen evidence of that”. That alone makes me have respect for him."
Einstein quote gave me goosebumps
Not really if you like can show the first hole law atomics in the hydrogen test to super state cooling and via a magnet to the fishtank test interaction between matters yes I went to class. And the one that at the HLC particle test they missed it so??? Only took them 5 year's...most don't even know what there playing with to sucking it out and cancelled that change to time space curvature and a bend in that charges that attracts+ to the neg invert fabrics it will never be back morons we say stupid idiots....
Thank you
The way brian speaks about nature really speaks to me. It is something you can comprehend out of complete incomprehension and mystery.
12:51 - The Strokez
He looks very similar to keanu reeves .....
"It's the start of time, the singularity is giving birth to another universe in another dimension! The universe is recycling itself."
Why am i so stupid🤔
"I believe that quantum computing will bring evolve our understanding of physics in a way that we are not ready for.
I bet in 10 years time our physics itself as we now it will not exist anymore."
"Just a thought, if God is sentient energy, not constricted by space and time, and all things are created of Him & by Him, wouldn't that explain his omnipresent nature & all of us, upon death return, as a soul, to our source, from which we are entangled, perhaps quantumly, thus rejoining the source of the ""big bang?"" We are conscious, after all, and very likely the only conscious lifeforms in existence. Special would be an understatement."
Quantum mechanics proves consciousness is what exists in the universe.  Science and religion are merging....for the better.
any way to find out who did the music to this?
I need to know the music used please
So much speculation about black holes when we've never even been close to one and probably never will be.
God made black holes to suck up the asteroids that fly across space. It’s to show you and be another proof afterlife is real
"If this guy was my lecturer at university, I’d actually never miss his classes. Manchesters Uni is luckily asf not many people are able to teach such advanced topic in such a digestible yet comprehensive way."
I believe.that certain conceptions here are overly thought out and understand why As an artist there are numerous possibilities to lead certain goal and outcome clearly   Here the logic includes numerous potential solutions as the final answer may just be the simplest I hearditbutyoucsn guess..:

All matter gets broken down in the blackhole…into its smallest component…before it crosses the event horizon…
"No, it does not go into singularity, rather it is ejected back into space…"
The fact that it ejects matter in the form of particals and radiation on both poles in every galaxy tells me that it is a three dimensional object.
The question is : is it a two dimensional object or a three dimensional object?
Where's this blackhole then ?
Brian cox has made the universe interesting ✨
"There is a hole in the logic that we can reconstruct objects that fell into blackhole. If we set fire to a book, you can only reconstruct it back from remains if you knew how it burned into the finest detail. So you need remains and process how it was deconstructed. Remains itself do not tell you the arrangement those particles were in."
I love these Astronomy Digests 📖
Im so confused
Best way to describe confusions
the big bang was just another death of a black hole star
I wonder if we'll ever be able to travel at light speed... That would open up so many possibilities of reaching other life out there.
love it
Forever He has no beginning and no End He we will always be learning  forever is His will for us listen learn wait hahaha
Blackholes are just god vacuuming crumbs up
"What if it doesn't seize to exist, but it reaches critical mass and stand still in time. We can't see it anymore, but it's there, just back in time. Only to reappear when it collides with mass and starts time again."

"Black Holes 
Trump & Musk 
Suck The Energy Out Of World"
"Complete novice here and I expect this idea can be debunked easily but could the singularity of a black hole be the the other side of/what came before the Big Bang? Multiple universes and multiple black holes? I envisage each universe being a torus, inward direction it’s a black hole, in the centre the singularity/moment before the Big Bang , outward direction is the expanding universe. 
As I say, complete novice here. Please don’t be mean and instead help me to better understand 🙏✨"

"Revelation 4
After this I looked, and behold, a door
standing open in heaven! And the first voice,
which I had heard speaking to me like a
trumpet, said, ""Come up here, and I will
show you what must take place after this.""
2
At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a
throne stood in heaven, with one seated on
the throne.
3
And he who sat there had the appearance of
jasper and carnelian, and around the throne
was a rainbow that had the appearance of an
emerald.
4
Around the throne were twenty-four thrones,
and seated on the thrones were twenty-four
elders, clothed in white garments, with
golden crowns on their heads.
5
From the throne came flashes of lightning,
and rumblings and peals of thunder, and
before the throne were burning seven torches
of fire, which are the seven spirits of God,
6
and before the throne there was as it were a
sea of glass, like crystal.
And around the throne, on each side of the
throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes
in front and behind:
7
the first living creature like a lion, the second
living creature like an ox, the third living
creature with the face of a man, and the
fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.
8
And the four living creatures, each of them
with six wings, are full of eyes all around and
within, and day and night they never cease to
say,
""Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty,
who was and is and is to come!""
==And he who sat there had the appearance of
jasper and carnelian  is Neutrino and the throne is the black hole (Seraphim) and orbiting 24 stars(24 thrones) around. around black hole (dark energy), Rain bow, lightening, tunder and sound are ususal"
There is some information saved around a black hole. It's hairy.
There are white holes also.
I always wondered how spaghetti was made.
Are they worm hole entry points?
sir does a singularity have a single property ?
"and what will you do with this knowledge? monetize it? build a weapon from it? bah. why not simply enjoy your life, and appreciate the mystery for what it is. What science calls discovery, I call the rape of the natural universe."
"I only have one question, why use the fire background while saying
Into what nature seems to be trying to tell us."
"If time stops at the event horizon, does thought stop as well?"
"After seeing entire video, I understood nothing 😭"
So scientists want to make The Time Machine. May god protect us this evils
So what happens when a black hole loses enough mass so that it can no longer trap light?
A glimpse of something deeply hidden! 😲😲😲😲😲😲😲😲
Wow!!  I need to watch more of his videos.
8:38 Incredible!...Seriously Incredible!!
Is it theoretically possible that black holes recycle one universe into another via a big bang theory event into an alternate universe ? ie an alternate universe on the other side of a black hole ? Is then possible for black holes with different masses to produce different relative sized big bang events ? What would happen if some black holes merged before producing a big bang event into an alternate universe ?
Sir how conaction between  black hole and Quntaam meqncis
music
Brian’s articulation of complexities of universe never fails to leave me in a continual of awe. He’s brilliant.
Brian Cox explained this in words humanly possible still English is my second language and again I lack IQ to understand this. But man this sounds so fascinating.
I do not understand
That is the most genius yet simplest way to explain a black hole omg
Where was the “you need to sit down while listening to this” warning haha😅
"Outlook just now thinking, black holes: ""How can nothing be"", if anything but the rules of the universe ""and its god"", --nothing as timeless, infinite bounded by nothing."
"I must be wise, because, whateverhe said, Its obvious to me."
Brian Cox is fascinating to watch.
"It’s intriguing.. the idea of black hole as suggested here.. aligns with the idea of Separation from Source, which multiple spiritualities speak of.. and the notion to return to source. This is very base level relative connection between science and some spiritual teachings in principle, so by no means do I know if this is accurate (my connection between the 2 theorems of life) but intrigues me to ponder further"
"According to the Quran, the universe began as a single, unified entity which Allah then ""clove asunder"" or separated, essentially describing a ""Big Bang"" like event; it further mentions the creation of the heavens and earth in ""six days"" (interpreted as six periods of time), with Allah establishing laws and order within the cosmos, including the movement of the sun, moon, and stars in their designated orbits; key verses highlighting this concept can be found in Surah Al-Anbiyaa (21:30) and Surah Al-A'raf (7:54)."
"What’s the difference between the Big Bang (start of our universe) and the experience from within a black hole as it forms ? It seems there are only two information barriers, the start and edge of our universe and black hole event horizons."
3026 who's still watching?
I would love to study Brownian motion in a black hole on Uranus.
I love black holes.   I love everything about them.  I also love pink holes.  I just love holes.
My biggest wish in life would be to understand the workings and secrets if the universe
This guy is amazing
love your videos!
Great work. keep it up Brian
"All this intelligence and not believing in God of the Bible, such a shame."

🕳🕳🕳🕳💤💤💤💤
instead of focusing on gravity itself. what if went anti gravity. we know that gravity has detrimental effect to transport. ok example if you travel on a train for 200 miles at 200 mile per hour you know will take about an hour. however if your above earth travelling at 200 miles would you not technically be slowing time? what if we flew with the flow? go the opposite direction and posibbly propel at a rate to dissuse earths gravity causing kinetic speed? just a theory though
Plenty of evidence to say what they are if you ask me material gathers enough to create a planet or possibly a sun so massive that even the light itself can’t escape the gravity of it just because it can’t be seen does not mean it’s a hole in space or warps space it warps the light
We are 8 or 9 billion people on this planet but why poeple who are interested in this the procent is so small why you don't want to know what is beyond earth we are part from the universe everything inside us is a part from the universe
"Why do we give weird people like him the spotlight? 🤨
He’s obviously on the spectrum"
"It feels like the integration of time as we know it might be the beginning of the wall blocking us from understanding the universe, time, begin and end I believe to be human things, human concepts, earthy truths that not necessarily apply to the universe. Like in earth we have the concept of up and down, which have no meaning in the universe, we cannot think that time, or the start or end of something has the same meaning in the universe as the meaning we give it in earth. Like was is my own origin, when does my own existence begin, when I am born? When I am a fetus inside my mom’s belly, when I am conceived, when my parents have sex and sperm reaches ovule, when they are born, when my grandparents are born? When do I begin to exist, EVEN, when do I ceases to exist is NOT absolutely clear, and that is on earth level, to try to imagine the universe’s beginning in human terms, I believe is impossible"
thats the loml
use metric and put subtitles for the bananas for scale.
"Are 3 dimensional view is why Einstein is wrong to a point , the light around a super massive black hole is to are view like lense warping,  infact if we were able to view in a different dimension  we'd likly see a complete different shape not a solid ring but a actual ring , toris is more likly being a hub of infinite information,  !"
Love this guy in EASE to communicate complex physics!!! Bravo
"looking for a key in a black hole, really, thats as desperate as can be"
"Just like nature, it recycles itself."
"As a spiritual person, I think black holes are a portal from the second heaven to the third heaven. As far as God allows."
What if : black holes are the worm holes we say that the worm hole connect to points the energy to keep them connected is gravity that why the light went into it get disappeared because it travels to the another point and starts moving forward so we don't see it
Sounds like the universe keeps recycling itself or cleaning itself. When he was saying the black hole will disappear but what happens to everything it has sucked in? Maybe that was the Big Bang. It gives an answer to what was before the Big Bang? Same shit lol.
His voice is so clear even for a pair of ears from 3rd world country that never speak english in daily basis.
Do we know the point in space where the big bang started?
It  can but you don't really know gravity yet.  Stop acting like you have answers let people look in other ways.  It has worked through history.
"Singularity can't exist in a blackhole as for outer time, since all that passed into it will never reach its center due to stopped time.
Same reason means that event horizon is not ideal sphere, falling masses are distributed very irregularly inside."
"Who defined that information is *physical magnitude* ?!
Separate particles do have parameters to be true information, multiple particles DON'T have *sum of information* (e.g. impulse), they have mean parameter instead (temperature).
At macro-level, information is human-defined set of data (what we consider important).

The essence of *enthropy* is _destruction of information_ — that's why you'll really never restore well-burned book."
I love the topics he’s focused on but I can’t understand everything he says.
This man makes me want to learn everything about space ❤
All of this to say god works😂😅
"why cover that beautiful room with a that white backdrop?! Some one should send that white background into the blackhole. Other than that, I LOVE Brian Cox and always listen to his amazing talks."
I can listen to Brian Cox all day
Off course we are in the Central 🤣 I don't need to say that we are already in a black hole. This is a cubic loop. You are looking far but the answer is in the opposite direction! But I am a just freak after all who knows 🥳
Why cant we send probes into black holes that can get data back to us?
"It's a reset. Information is a confusing term to explain it, in my opinion. Everything goes back to the most basic particles and then collides, combines, and gravitate until the most basic element is created and stabilized. Hence, reset the material back to the original state of creation. I had a theory that only if you imagine the elements at an atomic level, you can see. Imagine that this is a single element that way after the finite number of elements that are stable we know of then it's just nothing but a clump of protons and neutron trying to find its electrons, only thing holding them together is the density and gravity. Picture one standing inside a single hydrogen atom with 1 electron zipping around the orbit. Now, picture an insane amount of them together approximately a few billion light years across. You would see the same thing standing by the singularity as one would when you were inside the hydrogen but with an unfathomable number of electrons zipping around the core, aka singularity. I feel one  day, the full universe will be a black hole, and once it dies, bang, reset formation of everything again from the most basic particles to complex atoms and so on and so forth. The Big Reset to bring everything back to level one and combine randomly into more complex elements and form planets, etc. Information wasn't destroyed but reset to its basic form and can be created again in due time. Just might not be the same particles. Who knows, the phone I'm typing on was made from particles from the last reset belonged to a gas giant in a different galaxy, but after the reset they collided, combined, shifted into an element used here. Which make sense theoretically why it takes immense pressure in fusion of higher elements and why creation of heavier or rare ones to be made in the final phases of a nova where 2 factors create a double pressure situation, expansion and contraction final stand i suppose. It's all recycled back to basics and goes on. No information is lost or gained, just repurposed over and over.
Sometimes, complexity lies in simplicity.
Also, gravitational force is relatively weak compared to others, but it's undying. Once everything is maximized beyond stability. Only one thing remains gravity. Even time ends. Time is only relative to the observer or a point where we are able to observe it. We will never know how long everything to contract back to its original most basic particles. We are just observing what is happening in the expansion."
Time only exists on earth
Sooo... have we humans started to try to send satelites or anything into the gravitational pull already. Testing if we can still connect to them at certain points etc? Just to observe
Who gives you your food from the land and from to sky? Would you not protect yourself from disobeying Him?
"To who belongs, the Earth and The sky? Allah. I am being ordered to be the first of who submit themselves to God who took love as a principle on Himself."
I wish more kids are inspired by these glimpses into the fundamental truths/questions that scientists provide to us non/pre-scientists
"i could listen to this man for hours, so relaxing"
Nah I’m sure they are there for no reason
"The center is not a place in space, but a moment in time... The end of time.......... WTFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF that was incredible."
"This doesn't mean there is an Afterlife, dear friends of faith. It means the beginning and end we have assigned to our lives are arbitrary human ones. Nothing can ever really end because there is no beginning we can look so far back and see. Within the terms of this discussion, there is no dominant vector to life to look back to. So there is no before or after life that we can put a notch on and say ""It began here."""
I need your help   l can not speak English  l am depression
Professor Cox always makes complicated topics more palatable for the average viewer. You can literally listen to him all day and actually work out some of the things he says with relative ease.
I wonder if a black hole isn’t a black at all but a sphere of antimatter.
nothing more than a super-gravity source so we rappel across the universe; i thought it could help enclose the brain-breaking 'infinite-space' but it doesn't help explain infinite space or any space at all; so likely physical space doesn't exist;
Great video 👍
I love him...
This video ended too soon for me.  I need more lol 12 minutes felt like 2 lol
Can condensed particles be the residuo of a black hole?.
"Die schwarzen Löscher sind der Ursprung neuer Universen, vergleichbar mit einem Big Bang oder einem Wurmloch!"
When I was in college I saw a number of black holes
"Every 100 years ""everything we know is wrong""  So the answer is ?"
"Does that mean a black hole could be what we think the “big bang” is…? Cause if a black hole has a “shelf life” and everything will be released at the end of its cycle, then that sounds like “a beginning”…."
9:17 I wish I could like this again because Brian put words to a question I never knew how to ask.
"""The first sip of science makes you an atheist, but at the bottom of the glass God is waiting for you.”
- Werner Heisenberg"
The outcome is Qiyamah when everything will be brought back. Everything. Allahu Akbar!
"What may seem complicated and chaotic, could actually be elegant and simple."
Black holes are nothing more than redacted space
"So, this means it is possible even if a human dies it can be reconstructed by some mighty power."
"My question is, if particles are emitted from the entanglement surrounding a black hole, and this over time makes the black hole smaller, then instead of disappearing, would it not become small enough to become visible again? If the  reason it is black is because it is so large that light cannot escape, then becoming smaller would remedy that, no?"
Brian Cox is the Goat
Al theory and BS no body knows what is happening on space
ihr komt alle in Hölle wenn ihr so heiden seit
"ich war in schule, ich kan daß auch erkleren"
"I am at the wrong podcast. I swear I heard, “black whores”.🙀😉"
not any closer to what a black hole does
cox and blaack joles are a great combinition 💀
"no. ... there, saved you 10 minutes. open a physics book if u really wanna do science instead of watching whatever this is 😂"
Absolutely confused. Absolutely loved it.
Black hole. Is only a dead star.
"Crazy to think any one person on this planet could be the answer to these problems. But we dont co-exist in a way that would allow for a good chance of us finding them. Maybe that statement on its own is scratching at the exact issue.

I cant help but wonder why ive never heard the way brian described einsteins thought on discovering new things. Look at nature very carefully. Keep pulling at the different intellectual threads. Then about what is nature trying to tell us. Its the first time ive heard that surface as words. The way id describe it is that it feels as though there is some innate functionality, a means of progression and understanding to nature. As though as much as it seems we are seperate or different in any sense could be blatantly wrong. Maybe that nature looks at us the same way we look at it."
"Internet is confusing.
Mr cox was questioning : what happen to the stuff that fall in it but some other scientist said that nothing fall inside them, they just destroy anything they have around and it becomes ""dust"" orbiting around them. What is the true version?"
"Can you do a video on this pls. the moment before the ""big bang"" happened has all the elements of being a huge black hole where nothing can escape. so how did the big bang happen? The big bang theory is in conflict with the theory, or facts of black holes."
"Yes, Hawking Radiation; but what about Quasars?  💫"
"Brian Cox is the best at explaining what he is saying so us idiots can understand the universe , brilliant video , Awesome man ."
"I always thought black holes were alien shields to stop future catastrophes from world ending asteroids hitting their home planet, they also rotate the shield (black hole) to collect and mine the precious metals from any asteroids that have been netted, all the black holes if a line was drew straight pinpoints to the aliens home planet/planets, the device is a giant interstellar ring that rotates and the disperse of energy creates a vortex swirl of energy that is being released.

Obviously this is just a theory and to have public information prevented on the positions and placement of the blackholes raises further speculation of to why I think this way.

Aliens don't exist, this is just my theory =)"
The simplest explanation of blackhole ever i have understood in my life 2:45 .
I need a channel or podcast of him just like this
what is incinerated is incinerated
I love Cox
Even when physicists talk about black holes it still sounds like mumbo jumbo.
"Brian with the help of a few other people, as well as what AI is bound to become, may figure out a way to travel the speed of light as some sort of wave, that has eyes. One can only hope"
Hvis alt kan igjennom renopreddes så kan vel alt av mennesker som har død igjennolives.?
"Could we he living in a waterlike thing 
Where in blackhole that waterlike substance gets drained"
first learn how to reconstruct lost info from a burned book before we can even reconstrct info from radiation
"The funniest and ridiculous interpretation of the video is how most people would just right in to say that the hidden part is God😂😂😂, when they don't realise that it's actually just pure information that we're looking for..❤"
"Hey, Brian, tell me this. So black holes are created off of massively dense objects. Show stars and things like that. So at the big Bang, it became an entire known universe from one singularity. So tell me how did the entire mass of our universe compacted into one singularity, not turned into a black hole."
What I like about YouTube is that I can watch idiots crash their cars... And this
I was flabbergasted for 12 minutes straight without knowing what I was flabbergasted about.
"I am not a trained astronomer. Truthfully, I have never even been good at math. But lately I've been delving into this topic on my own time, looking for patterns, and the hypothesis presented in this video- that black holes are responsible for storing all universal information- was the hypothesis I kept returning to. There is something final about this idea to me. I feel impossibly fortunate to be witnessing it in my lifetime. Now that I'm on this frequency, I will continue to observe it. Hoping all the people much smarter than me in the field will be doing the same.
Thank you for the video."
"Beautiful video , I love it as it explains ."
I have a hard time with understanding that time is like something thats physical and can exist and can stretch or can slow down or go faster
I put cox in my black hole
"The singularity in center of black hole is as you said so bend that it is no longer a location in space but in time, so it is as you said a time in the future, as you said the end of time. As such is literally is afterlife heaven a place we will in the end as humanity also evolve. So it is literally traveling into the end of time, a white space in heaven where the creators who also started the whole universe aka ""Gods"" exists, our future where everything is perfect and infinite. Yes, literally heaven for all purposes of what religions describe it and more."
"We're going to need more scientists, less bullshit if you even want to get close."
Were a souls made in the big bang?
This guy is pure therapy for my ears
May Allah the king [GOD] make it easy for all of us.
Beautifully rendered storytelling.
Im wondering if he prefer to call him Brian or just Cox
"If it’s given back, almost like a big bang"
Whats that piece of music? 09.42
Wonder if gravity is the actual measurement for time and not how we think time works. 😂
"If black hole destroys information, then it implies, it also destroy entropy. So in far future, entropy will tend to maximum or will it be destroyed by black holes"
8:01 all that’s left if Ps5 Start screen .
he's majestic explaining. thank you and thank brian.
I LOVE THIS GUY
I get scared😅🫡😐 every time I watch these videos
"If particles are entangled. Then there is some conexions  between what interacts with that particle in and out the blackhole. Then as inside the blackhole particles are dismantel infinitively, as a theory, It might permit evolution in a future or even in the present of the whole universe. Comunication between posibilities and facts."
Yes please have Brian Cox more often. Thanks
Why i feel like he is a paid actor to talk about QF.
I could hear him talk for hours
"When two black holes merge or as you say fell in 

You just described the Big Bang"
The reality of our situation is more fascinating than any work of fiction ever created by humans
"Who designated this guy an expert. Theories , conjecture, opinions does not make a mimicking parrot an ""expert."" Your theories are more valid. Thank you."
Black holes are door ways
"His explanation is easy to understand even for me who likely a dumb person,"
I think our universe is in a black hole.  If we thought that way wouldn't that answer a lot of questions?
I think black holes are what new universes are born from. From the other side.
And what if a black hole is considered the beginning of time
"No, the black hole will NOT just disappear.
If it is true that a black hole has a mass so great that the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light, and it is true that the mass of a black hole decreases because of the entropy of hawking radiation, then at some point, the mass will decrease to the point where the escape velocity will be less than the speed of light. 
At that point we should be able to ‘see’ what the once black hole looks like. Maybe it will look like a star, maybe it will explode, something. But it will not just disappear."
❤
Jre podcast condensed lol. I admire Brian and his work
Brian Cox talking about black holes..
"An artist wall of oil, paint, light and dust. And a center of pulsing unseen red, blue neon light wave outward."
I'm unclear as to what constitutes information.
"Time is the function of the expansion of the Universe. Density can change the rate of time. As galaxies move further away from the cosmological center, they speed up compared to everything outside of the center. However, to follow this line of thinking, the closer to the beginning of the Universe, time goes slower and slower to the point that it stops. We like to call that point, the Big Bang singularity. Infinite mass / density / energy / weak radiation / strong radiation. Time is not part of the singularity. Time can only start when the singularity begins to expand. Time doesn’t stop until the singularity reaches its maximum excised state. Quantum Entanglement can no longer occur due to all particles stretched out at an accelerated point. It’s impossible for the universe to expand beyond, which essentially stops time. At this point, all radiation would invert, all atoms would have no energy to allow the electron to orbit around particles. However, the void left behind would be primed to be occupied by another big bang. Where would that singularity come from in the first place? Out of nothingness, it slowly begins to appear. It unravels due to the inversion energy left over from the previous universe. It takes the entire energy of a universe to crack open a singularity (infinite energy expulsion)."
The end tyme of any matter is into the miniscule strand/ quantum form...stops there
"So..
Light simply rushes in faster than you can see it...
Never to return..."
"Assalamu alykum.
I could vouch that There is reversal of / in time at the centre of a black hole..
That's shy light cannot escape....it's nature is to flow forward only...See?"
"The Cosmic Cycle of Black Holes, Energy, and Nebulae

Black holes are often seen as destructive cosmic entities, consuming everything in their path. However, this perception only captures part of their true role in the universe. Black holes, when they consume matter and energy, undergo a fascinating transformation, releasing immense energy in the form of a quasar. This energy is what powers the black hole and fuels its surrounding space. But what happens once the black hole has reached the peak of its energy release?

After a black hole has consumed all the matter it can and released its energy in a dramatic burst, it enters a state of void. In this state, it no longer has the power to resist the incoming flow of energy. Without the capacity to create new forces, it becomes like a deep well—empty and unresisting. Over time, this energy-filled void eventually begins to equalize with the surrounding space, transitioning into what we perceive as ""normal space"" once again.

However, the energy that the black hole once released doesn’t vanish. Instead, it disperses and flows outward through the galaxy, universe, and beyond. It spreads through space, seeking denser areas where the pressure and density can once again trap it, much like how energy is drawn into a black hole in the first place. These regions of dense space form what we call cloud nebulae—vast, swirling clouds of gas and dust. It is within these dense clouds where the energy finds itself caught in a cosmic quagmire.

As the energy interacts with the immense pressure and density of these nebulae, it triggers the birth of new stars, planets, and galaxies. The energy, which was once pure and untouchable as it was consumed by the black hole, has now undergone a transformation. It has changed back from energy into matter—giving rise to new life in the universe. This process is the next step in the cosmic cycle, where what was once destroyed becomes the raw material for creation.

In essence, black holes don’t just destroy—they are part of a grand, cyclical process that continually renews the universe. The energy released by the black hole travels through the cosmos, finds its way into dense regions of space, and eventually transforms into new stars and planets. It’s a constant cycle of birth and rebirth—where nothing is ever truly lost, but instead continually evolves into something new.

This idea of black holes acting as catalysts for creation—where they fuel the formation of nebulae, stars, and galaxies—helps us understand the universe not as a place of destruction, but as a dynamic system of ongoing transformation. In this model, black holes play a crucial role in the creation of matter, as the energy they release eventually becomes the material from which new cosmic bodies are born.

Background music makes it difficult to follow along. Thanks for the valuable video.
2:48. That is the most genius yet simplest way to explain a black hole omg 😮
2025‼️‼️‼️ Who Watching Brain Cox
I think God made black holes to completely mess with physicists. Pretty sure. Seriously  black holes are super cool unless im too close.
chinese genetics A.I. has chose his team. say it correctly Elon Enoch. or dont say it at all
Interesting
(((^_^;) Black holes is an anarchy computer intelligently designed for the police that YouTube song blue on black. They won't have anarchy blindness and will benefit from anarchy. The imagination of the universe is anarchy poems that nice. I went completely through a black hole with an anarchy poem and they made a rendering with video game technology that was better than a picture.
What a phenomenal scientific communicator!
Damn I was like he's keeanu reaves
What if all the matter that goes into a black hole comes out the other end in a new universe and because the matter is compacted so tightly it explodes like a new big bang on the other side
Is this horrible background music is really needed ??
His understanding is absolutely crazy. How is it possible to explain that well.

"So if you survive, going to the singularity. Can you start over or is it so many years ahead, you don’t know where the beginning is. Or so many years behind. Who knows?"
"get quantum entangled particles, shoot 1 half into a black holes, measure the ones you keep in a lab? 😁"
Now Brian Cox on black holes 😂 couldn't have picked a better person
the waitlist for his classes must be bananas!
Beautifully Explained!
Somethings are not meant to be known. I think this is where human thinking and our limits of observation as 3 dimensional beings end. Its an intellectual brick wall which we arrived with our intellect and which is what limits crossing it ironically.  Humans are therefore humans.
"no matter  how simple he explains it it just blows  your mind, i have learnt so much"
"For nothing is hidden, except to be revealed; nor has anything been secret, but that it would come to light. Mark 4:22

Thus says the LORD,
Stand by the ways and see and ask for the ancient paths,… Jeremiah 6:16"
👏👍
Maybe black holes are like a giant time capsule holding everything in it until the end of time so that when the universe goes dark itll just reset which if that is true (purely speculation) then that means the universe is just in a endless loop
"The event horizon for Brian Cox, will be on his tombstone, with no explanation. He's the guy that thought about it his whole life. Just ............................ nothing."
I don't believe the atom pulls apart in a black hole because the black hole admits radiation.
I am dieing but until that happens I am a Photon Sphere. I am the light emitted from the blackhole that comes from other particles that have gone past the Event Horizon but can not be sucked down into infinity at moment in time. I am light as it bends around the blackhole. I also believe that The Great Attractor has so much light that we are unable to see the largest blackhole in existence that is pulling everything into this space. It's gravitational pull is beyond are wildest dreams!!!♾♾♾
Loan or depends on fee.
Keanu? 👀
they dont exist .
So... physics through quantum principles will be able to explain a deeper level of biology??
Wish i could speak complex things with such an ease like Brian Cox...such a pleasure to listen to this guy...
We need this man alive forever
No need to go that far. Just finalize a cure for Cancer and Diabetes. It should be easier than figuring out a black hole.
"Why photons even though don't have mass get attracted  by gravity ??
Why it is distorted??"
He's much better than Neil.
What if we are already in one.
Please read Seyed Kazem Mousavi's articles on six-dimensional space-time. He has solved all the problems of physics.General Balance in the Six-Dimensions of Space-Time
how could an object exists when an end of time is also within that object
"(My two cents before I watch.)
Black holes may be basically invisible because, There's no room for heat/ radiation, inside of it.
If black holes are indeed solid.
 It's dissipated through Gamma rays bursts, Back out into a cosmic web/fields, from the outside. Much like the pulse of an electric fence. Energy runs on the outside of wire, not the inside.
This action acts as thrust keeping things in balance and spinning around the black hole. Without thrust we don't have Gravity. Without this there there are no galaxys. Thrust to leave a world Reverse thrust to return. Balance.
Thrust is why the cosmos moves.
And what holds us, and all matter together.
Nutrinos and other high energy particles may play the part of keeping mass like Asteroid still floating.
Now let's say all mass and energy is consumed. And let's say only thing left are the black holes.
These black holes have no thrust, so they will fall.
 Only to gather once more into one, which selfie nihilates adding thrust to them and matter to consume for this thrust. Repeat..ect. 
A self-starting harmonically balanced oscillation wave form. Think of radio waves. The only sound that travels through space. Us. You, me, all there is. 
It doesn't have to be all black holes that gather, just one of a particular size. And then it has a black hole quake like the Wow signal star. Which could set off a chain reaction amongst other black holes. Sound waves. Those waves could travel for tillions or more light years in all directions. Some Galaxys would look old some look younger.
Time is something that is there whether anything else exist or not.
   It's not something physical. It's just something to help you conceive things in stages. It's a tool that comes from math and just plane observation.
It is what it is, or would not be.

Now i'm no physicist , but I did stay at a Holiday INN once."
I think black holes digest all the materials and add on to the expanding space.
"Darkness can only travel as far our universal mass will allow.
We expect the light from the sun as a given source.
As previously mentioned Brian Cox  every light casts a shadow.
We'd be stupid to think that shadow was the end of light.
The mass of shadow is absorbed by the nearest blackhole.
 Mass energy?"
Brian Cox is like Cilian Murphy of science
"The black holes does not exist in the physical realm because their math does not operate in the real physical space. Together with the theories of quantum mechanics, dark matter and energy, cosmic and biological evolution and relativity,  are part of the occult yin-yang like dualistic religion of the rules of this world. They preach and impose their religion as science in the scientific world and society. It presents the interdependence of the creative and destructive force in nature. Equality between good and evil. Actually with this religion they are trying to justify evil as needed for the good. To be known and to exist. But this is a deception.
 The ultimate reality in our life is the Creator. Who is light and in Him there is no darkness. It is not necessary
to exist evil in order to exist good. It is necessary to know God and have complete trust in Him!"
He has such a way of explaining fantastic things to simple folk like me.
This is the person I can watch while I’m hitting my pen going to sleep
Is the end state of a black hole a new big bang or the Big Bang? Are we the first universe? Is our entire universe in a black hole?
"Its obvious that finding out anything about universal travel would unlock some knowledge,  lol  wow, 😊."
"I like this idea but I have to disagree with the logic that if you were to retain and keep every quantum state, particle, sub atomic particle etc, the way a black hole does/would, that in theory you should be able to recreate what once was, as in information is conserved. He's right, energy is always conserved, but that doesn't mean irreversible conservation can be reversed, burning is often regarded as an irreversible process, even if you were to contain that event, and keep the energy and all matter accounted, it is still irreversible, you are physically changing the matter itself into a different energy that''s being quantized differently, I get the idea of an overall mass/energy balance, but to reverse an irreversible process is like having god powers."
Brian Cox > Niel Tyson
What if the distorted particles emitted are directly tangled with dark matter. It’s almost as if black holes are collection points for everything. The universe’s way of intaking info and emitting dark energy to continue the expansion of the universe
"Why everytime i see some cientist talk about this stuff, i feel like they are high?"
Not any beautiful single person?
what is the song at 6:30 pls help
p
This is brilliant and rationally mystical.  The great sages of eastern philosophy would love this.  Hooray Dr. Cox!
"Read Erasmus Montanus, still very relevant today. 
OH he did it. Showed the interstellar blackhole  as how it looks like. Which are BS, This was how they imagine a black hole looked like, when they are Really close up."
"We will never be able to understand Infinity, to try would drive us insane."
6:26  11:58
Have you even heard of Ramanujan who first spoke of Black holes ? I pity you Scientists
I love this man. Science!!! <3
Black hole are Gods garbage disposal system
need more videos with Brian Cox
I often think our eyes are black holes.
"This is how students in Caltech felt after listening to Feynman's lectures...!
When he is speaking you seem to understand it but no sooner the lecture is over, it's all lost..!!"
"black hole  evolve, as their entropy decrease, towards order, with information preserved in a progressively organized manner and emitted through the entangled Hawking radiation....10.59973/ipil.126"
"Gravity is not a pull, it's a pushing force, you are pushed towards the black hole, and it is pushed towards you. The reason (how) it's a push, is because it requires energy length to cross distance, a true attractive force would require infinite energy, thereby violating conservation of energy. It's a Planck force differential (gradient), as a result of Planck mass differential, not in meter space but rather general relativistic space (a contracted meter has less pushing power vs a longer meter in general relativistic space, gravity is the Planck force differential). The bisector reflection of inverse directional momentum (on local intersect) is the core transform mechanic of the universe, it renders all forces (this is how you get ""for every action, there is a equal and opposite reaction"")."
I need Brian Cox to start his own YouTube channel!
"Will block hole disappear/collapse/dies????
I think it’s yes, when black hole bursts all surrounding material(means all the stars) and black hole will collapse/die.  It’s my wild theory.  What do you think Mr Brian??? Please answer if you see this comment."
What lies center of black hole?? Answer is nothing.  Black hole is cosmic low pressure.  When surrounding material gravitational pull determines the size of the black hole.
The universe is not old enough for a singlearty to exist !
"A round dot like a quartz particle is also uncertain and has quantum states such as velocity, position, rotation, and properties such as color and odor are not the same.
In fact, string theory and M theory are so complex and lengthy that it takes a scientist hundreds of years to solve their equations with the requirement to be absolutely accurate in all results, so they have been ignored by many leading scientists to find other theories of everything.
Every time there is a stalemate, string theory is added to 1 dimension to form the M theory. Then he put thousands of wonderful things in it. So small, how can there be a universe and the perspective of other creatures in it? While they have already defined it as the limit of matter.
It's the same as observers who use mathematics to calculate and then record the time that stops when astronauts plunge into a black hole. In fact, our esteemed astronauts will plunge into black holes at the speed of light."
Is a black hole like the pupil of an eye?
"Nawet bym się nie łudził na milimetr.... :D. Jedyne co będzie je rozwiązywało, to kwestie których ani nie znamy... ani tym bardziej nie widzimy (sam nie wiem co byśmy w ogóle bez tych śmiesznych oczu zrobili.... xD).... I te rzeczy których nie znamy i nie widzimy będą łamały wszelkie teorie jakie dotychczas powstały i tak zacięcie je wałkujecie w tym you tubie ;).... A póki co - wiemy, że nic nie wiemy :).........."
Allah is the greatest
I think earth fell into a black hole and reset thats why we dont have the knowledge :)
Its impossible for a black hole to move right because its streching the fabric of space
"So, some of what I stated was not quite correct, as I thought it would be the case when I wrote it. The point was a different perspective on what may be occurring. So, the blacksphere, when it's born, the EMF flips and creates the boundary, the spin I believe increases and decreases with available materials, and with this increases and decreases the strength of said boundary. The charge is what's used up as the materials are destroyed. The information you're describing is what people call dark matter. Materials unable to hold a charge. Best guess. Peace ✌️ 😎. The boundary grows equally in strength to materials available so as not to be overwhelming. Nothing gets in. Nothing gets out. It's the boundary that grows not the sphere itself. Just an opinion."
Hawking radiation is purely termal. It's does not have information
"I have no clue what he is talking about,
but I could still listen for hours."
YESD
Keanu Reeves should play his character
"I'm sad to have to say this, but I think black holes were discovered by Uncle Ben while putzing around the kitchen with Aunt Jamima."
"Cox is only man who can explain the complex things in simple language,"
"When Brian smiles it seems the entire unverse within him, speaking the fact of complexity with God's voice! Thank you Brian."
10 years back I used to watch his documentary on space on discovery channel dubbed in Bengali. That’s how I know him. He is really good at explaining.
Really interesting!
"People like Prof. Cox are who our children should be looking up to. Not celebrities, nor sports figures, even musicians. But, people who inspire to challenge the unknown and answer the questions for the betterment of humanity."
Love him and his wise words on the topic but why does bro look like great value Keanu reeves😂
I could listen to him talk for hours
Brian Cox ❤️
"Why can't we truely accept that, that thing you keep saying we don't know is ""God"" so we all can rest."
"What if our universe's ""big bang"" was actually the death of a black hole from the previous universe"
"Brian Cox, not sure you have heard of the Vedas, but Erdinger, Einstein and many other physicists and mathematicians make references to the Hindu Vedas for astronomical physics and understanding the universe. Per the vedas, space and time are our own imagination and everything that is happening is only in the now."
How do we know that we aren’t in a black hole ourselves?
His mamma got a black hole.
8:30 what if black holes and hawking radiation like the “big bag@ is just the universe doing its job cleaning stuff up like a vacuum and then recreating new stuff with the hawking radiation like what if it’s just a recycling  machine
Is there any way to determine when a black hole actually begins? Or are we only able to detect that they exist by their gravity waves and Hawking radiation?
MORE 👏👏👏👏👏👏
So I’ve heard the theory that someday a black hole will dissolve basically. The question I’ve never heard raised or answered is during this process does the black hole turn back into a star of sorts? As it loses mass it will no longer have an escape velocity higher than that of the speed of light. What does that look like? Do we already see these and not recognize them? A rebounding black hole.

Everything we “know” about “space” is fake…. Why do people still believe this blackhole bullshit?
"I wish this video could go on and on and on and on.. and on...

This is super wonderful"
"Why am I  thinking about the ""bookshelf scene"" in the movie Interstellar?"
"That makes me think that UFO technology can manipulate gravity. By manipulating gravity, also time. To them, time is passing by normally in the  UFO, like a normal car ride. But to us outside observors of the ship, it looks like theyre zipping by at incredible speeds. And stopping on a dime. Manipulate gravity, manipulate your own time relative to everything else."
"How can so many people, who clearly lack even a basic understanding of scientific concepts that have taken centuries of effort and evidence to develop, be so confidently dismissive of them? It's frustrating to see such misplaced certainty and an apparent lack of capability for critical or scientific thinking."
Science is a religion.
I'm glad we have the D:Ream keyboard player on here to blather on about theoretical physics as if he's a credible man of science.

Why are they always flat? Why doesn't it look like a star glowing all round? Why is everything kind of flat...?
Let there be light.

Black holes do not exist
"Brian's explanation  of entropy was possible the best thing i had ever heard I'm a big roughty toughty bouncer in my 50s , and I'm not ashamed to say when i realised i understood what he was talking about i tiered up , actually understanding a scientific principal  for the first time could watch him for a year and not get bored i always come away with some thing significant to remember , like now , it had never really accrued to me that black holes are black because of the escape velocity of photons ...."
"If everything will be consumed by blackholes, if everything is brought to “the end of time” on the opposite end the perception would be instantly appearing at a location that doesn’t exist in a time that never happened, sounds like the beginning of everything happening at the end of everything"
I keep coming back to this video. The way he describes the singularity as a moment in time rather than a point in space is just riveting
"What Brian seems to be alluding too, seems to support simulation theory? Black holes being the nodes whereby our reality and time is fabricated on a quantum level? The deeper we go, the more it seems like there is a creator of some kind..call it God, A.I. whatever."
How the black hole would destroy the information. It can be explode not erase right. Matter cannot be destroyed
"I am NOT a scientist. But I've been watching alot of brian cox and niel degras tyson the past few months, and I've been having this idea, that if the universe is ever expanding, what are the odds that we're seeing the universe spaghettify because we're in a black hole. I watched one video where brian said there would be virtually no way of knowing we're in a black hole If it was one of the big ones. Can someone just tell me that's crazy so I can get back to getting sufficient sleep at hight?"
"I have never understood the end of time explanation.  If a black hole was here yesterday, and still here tomorrow, it is still a definite thing.  Just cause it destroys all information, they must account for something because they are different sizes..."
"Fraud. Being a flat earther is one thing, but saying the universe is flat is quite another !!!"
I wonder.  Science is realizing God exists... that nothing came from mere happenstance.  Does Brian believe?  (Time' running short to remain in disbelief).
This force us to think about our existence
"Sure, but stop interrupting his talk ! 😊"
"Occam's TOE (my nickname for the below summarized, which I hope is worthy of our esteemed friend's moniker):

By Einstein's Equivalence Principle, a particulate mass object held suspended at a specific height above the Earth's surface -- i.e. at a specific radial distance from the Earth's single point gravitational center of mass -- is being subjected to a constant point radially outward (vertically upward) accelerating force of, and thereby undergoing a rate of proper acceleration upward at, 32 ft/sec**2. 

The instant this mass object is released, it's vertical acceleration with respect to the Earth's single point gravitational center of mass ceases, and the still-""point radially outward"" accelerating [""3D""] surface of the Earth rushes upward to catch up with and overtake the now 'stationary' (traditionally understood and referred to as ""falling"") mass object and slams into it at a relative velocity determined by the vertical distance from (""height above"") the Earth's surface from which the object was released -- or equivalently -- a relative velocity (""kinetic energy"") determined by the ""time"" [as defined by and in terms of the relative (e.g. cyclic) motions of other mass bodies at the same relative ""size"" scale] elapsed since the object's vertical acceleration ceased being applied by the platform from which it was released (a.k.a. ""during which it was in freefall toward the Earth's surface""). 

If we reword, and correspondingly re-conceptualize, the scenario in this way, we recognize that the ""3 dimensional"" spatial extension of a mass-object (such as the planet we call ""Earth"") is actually a point radial extension in space constituted by that body's sustained (and progressively increasing rate proportional to the radial distance of its surface from its gravitational center) point-radial acceleration -- which we might validly conceptually reorient ourselves to recognize and understand as being the constitution of that body as a 'package' (if you will) of ""[pure, I claim,] point-radial momentum"", which we contemporary humans observe -- by means and in terms of the sequential impingements of multiple light waves with that surface -- and otherwise experience, and traditionally linguistically refer to (""indicate"" to each other and internally conceptually ""index"") as its ""inertial mass"". 

Note that, since the velocity of light is (taken by we ""human"" likewise mass-""observer""-objects as a baseline universal) ""constant"", any acceleration [such as that undergone point-radially by the ""3D spatially extended outer surface"" of a mass-object], as a continuous [over/as ""time""] change in velocity (e.g. by definition), constitutes a (sustained over/as ""time"") displacement from the constant velocity of light ""during the time"" (manifested by those multiple light wave/""photon"" impingements) that acceleration takes place. 

Note also that, because acceleration is a continuous change in the velocity of a mass-body's (relative) motion, proper acceleration can be described as a state of ""self-relative motion"" -- that is, as ""motion relative to itself [through/as space over/as time]"". 

[Following is my likewise relevant, and elaborative upon the above, commentary response to Veritasium's ""Hidden Universes"" video:] 
[Note as well that] In a hyperbolic geometry universe, the ""distance"", as perceived/measured in terms of other spatially extended (i.e. mass) objects by the ""observer"" (as also a mass object) at/as its ""center"", to the edge of the universe -- defined as the distance the light of the Big Bang has thus-far traveled -- is effectively infinitely far away in every direction around that center (of mass), in the same sense that the event horizon of a black hole would be to any mass-body ""inside"" of it. However, to an ""observer"" (with mass) who is ""outside"" of a black hole's event horizon, both the black hole's spatially extended ""size"" (diameter) and its ""distance"" away ""appear"" to (in terms of multiple sequentially impinging light waves) and are measured (as described above) by him to be ""finite"".  So, what's going on here? 

Might it be, perhaps, that the (unseen) path of individual light waves/""photons"" from one particulate (i.e. asymptotically ""finite""-bounded) mass object to another is hyperbolic, while the ""motion"" relative to each other at subluminal velocity (as necessitated by their reciprocal multi-light wave impingement manifested ""appearance"" to each other) motion of individual particulate mass objects relative to each other is ""linear""? And what are these ""separate individual"" particulate mass objects, as manifested to ""each other"" in terms of multiple sequentially impinging light waves, but [""gravitational (as ""curved spacetime"") lens""-focused] ""standing waveforms""? And if this be the case, then this ""material universe"" of particulate mass objects (including our own, and each other's physical bodies, which comprise the ""contents"" of one another's ""consciousness"", if you will) clearly comprises a single ""self-configuring"" network of spatially distributed I/O (of infrared light waves, at a minimum, due to their > 0 degrees Kelvin temperature) devices -- i.e. as a single 'self-aware entity' that has 'settled upon' (again, if you will) this ""network"" architecture as the mechanism of its self-constructing 'manifestation' of itself to itself.  As Descartes declared to be the foundational premise of his philosophy, ""Cognito ergo sum"" ([or ""SUM"" for ""(in the absence of its self-relative motion) Scale-Uniform Medium"", if I may be so bold] there must be a ""me"" for me to be conscious of, and to contemplate and conjecture the ""existence"" of, such as I've linguistically encoded and shared with you my body's 'on-board' ""conceptual"", i.e. neurological, map of [as (part of) its operational sensory-environment response ""program""] here).

So, fellow Anthropos Cartographer (or, if you prefer the Greek, ""homo cartographus"") species members, why don't we consider where we might take this 'epic story' (linguistically encoded neurological map) of ourselves from here."
"How can any one be exposed to such deeper understandings of the universe , of the creations and not believe in the existence of a supreme higher power- the existence of God? 
We have questions to which no plausible answers can be formulated because the very content of the question exceeds human comprehension. so when there are events that exceeds human comprehension then except a higher power , except God , who can ever have the answers to all of the unseen and the unknown? God truly is the Great. The powerful. The Supreme. 
all of the existing knowledge comes from Him."
If my Pastor was replace by this man I would never asleep in the church..
If the black hole BH is the end of time and information then it will also be the end of physical reality. If that is the case BH is the end of history but that also indicates the end of future and existence of physical reality. But as we all know consciousness is not limited by physical reality and can therefore be transformed into singularity of time and information in another dimension of existence.
Far better explainer than Neil DeGrasse Tyson
"I call bs on the part around 9:30.
Yeah you could recreate *A BOOK* with the information you gathered. You don’t know how to assemble it in every detail. You could create a book in which you just have scrambled words and letters and that’s it, assuming you have no prior knowledge of the exact book you want to create."
"I have a way of thinking that makes a black hole easier to understand: A black hole is a small space filled with so much matter that it gets extreamly heavy. This makes it like a pit that grows deaper and deaper the more materia it gets filled with - because that makes it heavier. 

When you think about like this it gets easier to picture how planets and suns can fit in such a small space and why they get ”sucked” inside at all. 

Now; how the black holes begin to exist is for the exact same reason - too much mass (for example two colliding suns) gets centerd in the same small space which makes the object so heavy (or the pit so deep, the way I explained) that every object ”nearby” sinks into it - which in turn makes the pit even deeper and so on. The depth goes within itself. This is the way I picture it to make it easier to understand. 

Or see it like this: When something is too heavy here on earth it begins sinking through the ground which creates a hole, which in turn makes things fall into the hole which makes the weight heavier and the hole deeper."

"I like how he uses ""In principal"" 👏"
"Has anyone ever thought maybe it’s not the end of time but the beginning of Time, the gravitational pull is that strong that it emulates the Big Bang?"
"So why do scientists still think those two theories are accurate? There's no way anything we know as humans modern day about space is accurate. For all we know black holes could be living beings or gods, wormholes organically or artificially created, remnants of bombs intelligent species set off in wars, or my personal theory which is that it is just space where most light has already passed through meaning light from that portion of the universe stopped then started again which is why the light appears to bend because it started then stopped which creates the appearance of a black hole."
Fascinating
"Physics, is so hard I hate it. However, some Physicists like Brian Cox can explain things in such a way that even my brain starts to like it."
I hate the way he wears his lips
Nah
Even if a matter that is in a black hole went to other dimensions it still has mass in this dimension. I find this fascinating.
The knowledge he exumes and his voice  could make you listen him the whole day
What is the escape velocity to get though the ergo sphere of a black hole?

"After the 6th extinction, it all won't matter."
And all of this is happening in an Atom in your toenail....
I believe there is no singularity in the black hole.  I think it's a polarized gravity hole.
When all the energy fuel of the universe - has been completely spent - and there's nothing left - down to the atomic level - complete zero energy - in the universe - wouldn't it just be black holes - that still exist?  And each black hole - would combine with one another - until every one- became one singularity - which in hense- would - absorb every particle - in the dead universe - then crush it down - to a point of its - beginning - and at the moment - when the last infatesimal particle - reached it final destination - inside a black hole- wouldn't it create another big bang once again?  Or am I just really high 😎
"Man, she sure has a low voice!"
I think we are in a black hole.
"Just remember, the universe created us so that we could study the universe.  If that isn't evidence of "" God"" in some way, idk what is proof. The universe is being discovered and figured out, BY ITSELF.  Still, that makes me go crazy."
I didn’t know Keanu reeves was a scientist
One of the clearest explanation of a black hole I've ever seen. Thanks to Mr. Brian Cox and the Big Think Channel.
What if nothing falls in?
you got something for me boy
These massive black holes The ones the size of our solar system or beyond surly must have parts of the event horizon that have weaker gravitation than other parts ! so what's stopping us from peaking inside there for a look see ))  a strong tether and a good winch anchored somewhere 🤔
"I think it’s a false equivalency to say information isn’t destroyed… we can’t preform alchemy, nor have the proposed quantum computers, or such technology otherwise for the most part, to assemble and change states of matter. A burned book can’t be reconstructed
A black hole pulls spacetime in such a way that it ‘slows’ time…
Really you’re ‘falling’ through spacetime at an accelerated rate. Spaghetti-fication is matter and time accelerating relative to the mass/gravitational force, so it’s not a question of if you could not be ripped apart
Right?
Wouldn’t it also make sense that radiation emitted from the black hole is the matter that went into it, after being smashed or ripped apart?
I don’t really understand the quantum vacuum fluctuation into pairs thing.
Seems like if anything were to escape a black hole, it’d have to reach some kind of escape velocity or be somehow unaffected by spacetime"
Brian explains this so well
Once I discovered black hos I was addicted to them
brother i swear on everything- you give my wife and kid a milli and you can send me into a black hole.
"Professor Cox always makes complicated topics more palatable for the average viewer. You can literally listen to him all day and actually work out some of the things he says with relative ease. Sure, some of what he’s saying are hard to work out, but he really does make it a lot easier for a lot of people."
black hole is just tunnel to another universe and in another universe it's makse sun ? just my little thinking about it :D
"Black holes are infinite point masses and gravity is still a weak nuclear force, but mass including the infinite point mass of a black hole is also a tremendous source of energy and more concentrated  the mass more its energy  content, so the energy in the point mass of a black hole will be very high and just as there are phases of take and give in everything, from business to pleasure, so also the universe will ensure that the take phase of black hole will flip around and turn into a give phase where its energy production  will be significantly more, and significantly better than its energy consumption. The laws of science are perfect."
"Both theories are wrong, if black holes real they would be the physics of counter space."
How can we send cancer to black hole?

Brian Cox is a universal treasure. The way he explained black holes really had me thinking if this what happens to our consciousness when we die ? Is death our black hole with our life time of  consciousness being released back into the universe after our death? Oh man heavy stuff
One of the greatest broadcasters of all time. Who thought you could make theoretical physics compelling all of us idiots who don’t understand a damn thing of it?
Just for the sake of relevance as well as for the fact that some great information about space time dynamic lies in the knowledge of life after death ... y dnt you read about the life after death as predicted by Islam @Brain cox
"If nothing can escape a Black Hole, no sound, no memory, no information or even light. Perhaps, it's possible.. A Black Hole, is where we go, when we pass away."
"According to some other theory, there is no end of time. Time is viewed as cyclic rather than linear. At the cusps of the oscillating universe, the fundamental principles of the universe are randomly arranged. And it is only a unique combination of these underlying principles that have led to our existence today. The black hole-emitted particles carry the same information as during the beginning of time because the newly originated light carries no information. However, a better understanding of dark matter energy is required to improve the ""theory of everything""."
Probably the best person alive right now
Much ado about nothing.  Check back again in 10 million years...and maybe we'll have a 1% better understanding.
Love this guy.
Inside a black hole is another demension. The 4th
"What if the universe as we know it, is hawking radiation?"
'fundamental' idiot
Unrelated to the topic but I find it admiring how clearly he communicates complicated physics concepts to us like I could never.
"This guy says global warming an sea levels will rise yet Plymouth Rock and the Roman Tidal Baths in Malta Prove There Is No Climate Change, dont believe this man total bell"
A think the universe bounces of its elf n keep creating a universe and to us it like jumping on a bouncy castle
Wtf did he say?
"I like how he explains the things in details ,so I do not feel dumb. He is a good teacher.❤"
"We are asking the wrong questions!  
There is no such thing as time
Distance yes
Gravity of course 
But time is merely a mathematical variable man kind created to explain a to b"
"1:00 Is the key to understanding universe, but a blank hole how does it first correct? It is cord a t*** in space. A existent explosion where 2 chemical reactions starts happening. But those chemical reactions is to opposite gases. Which collage together which causes a chain reaction. We see it in our space what we only conceive through photographs through colourful lengthen

In the colourful lands in United flight. That space shows gases where it spreads out. Put miracles colours, you see. Gas is getting poured in now. When the gas is again pulled in those gases, oq being obtained by black hole.

Now in the contents of that? I am just going to explain on my point of perspection

That's a black hole itself is created by assume sort of electrical gases. But the only way these gases can as she occur if 2 gas is closed. But they don't cause a chain reaction inside there. Because you need to element solid elements which clashes together in space, which causes a spark. Eruption explosion

No one exposed these gases flare out. Then get exhorged back in with a opening space space is a constituty of pressurise. We're pressure absorbs itself finn it goes out but it must come back in

So I'm just explained on my point. In perspection that I have a black hole is created. Natural gas is in two hard elements causing a united spot

Or a chain reaction to do with chemical which that doesn't mean the elements, but it depends which co. Existent of planet which has a chain reaction of chemicals which causes a Nuclear chain reaction bought. Everything is frozen in space, so maybe there's a gas which makes them a solid into a liquid. Maybe they are a roses which melts a liquid into a solid.
You never know on these particular kind of infrastructure behaviours. What you need cold vacuum air to do this"
Dr. Cox should do a joint podcast with Dr. Smethurst. Both are excellent science communicators. Even do a massive round table with Dr. Tyson lol.
they should be renamed. they aren't hole. they're just infinite singularities when immense mass.
Imagine if the bible wasn't written but the atoms of that book were repurposed from the secretion disc of a black hole.  Meaning that information is as old as time & our universe.
Fantastic
So refreshing to see Joe listen agog to stuff he doesn’t think he knows.
"Time was created by humans based off the observation of the earth, sun and stars. it's irrelevant to the universe. but he knows black holes? we don't know everything about the planet we live on, but some people want to explain the universe. he probably believes we can one day travel through time. good luck with that. punch in those irrelevant numbers. Good luck where you end up. hate to break it to ya, but the universe doesn't operate on our measurement of time."
Good night ❤
this was mental
"black hole is just another star, just with stronger gravity than magnetar so light cant escape.....same with speed of ligth..of course you can travel faster at some point....(my opinion...convince me I am wrong :-D  )"
Pretty darn good by really really big Texas standards
"Black holes more like hairy moles..
Unrelated, but does anybody know a good dermatologist?"
while we try to analyse the nature of our Universe we fail to grasp that it is cannot be quantified by human mathematics. Each blackhole is no more than a gate to time spewing itself into itself. Life isn't an organism it's a combination of time and space in an endless struggle of its own cyclic entropic event. Which cannot happen. It cannot end.
So could you say that black holes are basically an interstellar hard drive or memory stick?
Cox and holes def go together. Sorry had to..
"3:50 I have watched so many videos trying to explain this concept as I have recently become fascinated with the space time, continuum. This is the most succinct explanation I have heard so far. My mind is still blown, but at least I can now put it into words."
"What I like most about him is that there is no antagonism with him, there's no aggression, he takes what he's learned and says ""I believe"" or ""I think"" and its based on what he's learned, so someone like myself who believes in God and have a good understanding of science can enjoy his work. He's an atheist but said ""we don't know"" which is uncommon in today's aggressive ""pick a side"" generation. I enjoy all his work as a result because his mind isn't thinking about the things that divide us as people, he just genuinely loves what he does and then enjoys passing on what he's learned and what he thinks these things mean without belittling those who don't know or those who may feel differently."
What if ….. the universe is just…. One…. Black hole
He kinda looks like Keanu Reeves
Been a fan of this man for 20 years. YouTube STILL recommends his content to me. Much love and respect brother.
Ik zou uren aan 1 stuk naar brian cox kunnen luisteren...
"n my opinion, the early universe (big bang) is us coming through a black hole. This is why the expansion of our unvierse is increasing in speed. It's because our universe is stilll being ejected from the other side of the black hole. I beleive it's an endless dance (cycle) of universes being swallowed by black holes and ejected out into the othe side, only to be swallowed once more."
There was a boom of flatearthers... and now what do we have to deal with? Blackholers?
"AVP 👽 
I get that / the status , and the natural world 🌍 / right / but I try to theach softly. ...but /"
He looks like James Blunt
Cox is making a fortune pushing all sorts of unproven theories - I wish he would evaporate and leave science to the real scientists
Wish I was high
İ want what he's smokinnn
"Yo, brian cox is fucking rad."
What mysteries of the universe?
Using miles... so medieval!
"I really enjoy how Brian has touched on this subject.  A bit of faith, a bit of science, a bit of harmony and a large amount of humility.  It could be b
Black holes are a universal recycling bin, or maybe the birthplace and recorder of every moment or vector."
"I can only wrap my head around bits of this but OMG! Fascinating and exciting. Love Brian, he’s the best 🎉❤"
Jeremy Bearimy
Black holes are ports to the hard drive of the simulation. It's where random data points are collected.
"*Stellar mass black hole (star destroyers) are portals to new universes in the multiverse. However, it's also known as the ""Lake of Fire"" in the Bible. There's no time in there... So if you get caught in one, you'll be crushed down into the holographic singularity, or imploded star, and be electrocuted FOREVER until it big bangs itself! Which they are usually set on cycles. Sometimes they already explode themselves, other times they just sit there for infinity-X....*"
"Just once can someone tell me what counts as ""information""?"
"Inside you'll find the pixies of chaos. Interdimensional entities that inhabit the infinite, 'inside' space and time, where before and after do not exist."
Lee Cynthia Robinson Frank Lopez Sandra
"The center of a black hole is a portal to the final moments of the universe. A line in time so thin that it intersects with the first moments of the Big Bang. The so called white hole and “separate” universe that is calculated to be on the other side of a black hole is simply the beginning of the next cycle of our own universe. Light is basically a ruler of the speed of time. Where light cannot move from an outside perspective, time goes goes by infinitely fast. All black holes are windows to that singular point in time and space where time and space ends. So in a way all black holes are the same."
Why try to force these theories to work with eachother?
Black holes are the universe's entropy regulators. They disolve what entropy put together so that it may be repeated once more. For what else is the inverse of entropy in nature? Where else does space and time stop allowing anti-entropy?
"over thinking these, and achieving will only lead to colossal destruction and damage.
obvious war weapons.

side note black holes dope lolz"
We’ve already been shown whats in the centre of a black hole: a tesseract made by future humans where you can infinitely see Murphy Coopers room from the 5th dimension
Could it be our math is pointing us back to the transition of life before the Big Bang as we know that before then time didn’t exist because mass didn’t. (Packed together=tensions to explode) This was a time before space and time so when traveling through we experience these realities of our world/physicys slowly melting away beginning with time as mass had to begin for time to even start so like a onion first goes the time then next goes mass this is as to why our calculations can no longer calculate beyond this point- Matthew Cardenas
I've seen a few black holes in my life and they indeed swallowed matter with high intensity
"Based on the theory that a black hole does not erase information and has finite lifespan, and taking into account the concept of Hawking Radiation, is it possible that when looking at the idea of the Big Bang and the way the universe is expanding, does this all together possibly point towards the Big Bang simply being the end of the lifespan of a black hole discharging the remainder of the particles it gives off back into space?

My choice of words is most likely confusing or incorrect but is the idea that a black reaching is end/ending and discharging the remainder of particles a possible explanation of what the Big Bang is??

Would really love to know what others think and would happily like to know if is an idea that has been ruled out already."
Great to hear and be educated by him 🎉🎉
Too boring for me.
"Why did they put a white screen behind him? Either show him in the personal library naturally, or use the screen for some purpose. Looks so dumb. Producers 💩"
I challenge Brian Cox to a public debate
"This is the worst science I’ve ever seen
Black holes are not voids. They are solid mass made up of matter and anti-which repel each other yet are held together by gravity and rotation. This is how it ingests and ejects. 
This guy is a renowned scientist on top of 
This is an example of when you build physics around models and models around real physics"
Black holes are a mixture of matter and anti-matter we’ve known this since the 70s
Black holes are a mixture of matter and anti-matter we’ve known this since the 70s
"Brian, you've done it again!"
"I think people take for granted the magnetic fields in creation and the roles they play in understanding creation with gravity, etc. More studies should be done on the roles of magnetic fields and the spinning of objects such as planets and molecules. Most probably gravity is the result of magnetic fields due to spinning objects."
"Someone please help me understand this in earth terms. The black hole question is if a human corpse is incinerated into ashes, could we take those ashes and Frankenstein the human back together? I'm feeling a huge disconnect. Any help is appreciated!"
His voice is soothing...or is it just me.
"I always thought that the Big Bang was the result of multiple supermassive black holes to the extent larger than we can can even think, and they all collided together and when it couldn’t hold its gravity anymore it collapsed in on itself sparking the Big Bang. Obviously these multiple supermassive black holes would have had to have swallowed up pretty much everything in the universe as well for this to happen. If a black holes point of singularity is the start or end of time like they say, wouldn’t it make sense that the singularity of a black hole could be the start of our universal time? I always thought it was just an infinite cycle of this but one giant universe and it corrects itself every whatever billion years it takes to reach the end of the process. The universe teaches us that death is necessary for new life and that there is no reaction without an action first done something had to be here as well as do something to spark the Big Bang"
I prefer white ones.
I saw a lot of black holes on pornhub !
Leave em closed… trust me… there are things on the other side that you don’t want to see or even know about.
One of the best videos Ive watched
"There is only space ,no time at all ,it's man made"
I was looking for information on black hoes 😂 lol (a joke if you are woke cancel culture)
Very nice and informative
"20 seconds in you inaccurately state ""we think we have full controle of the physics"".
The entire problem with cosmology is that you are trying to work around the fact that you have no formula for a Gravity -Time ratio. Even you highly respected as you are could not answer me if I asked you ""By what percentage does Moon time move faster than Earth time?"" beyond asserting that ""Gravity slows time ""neither you nor your colleges have a formula you can point to as you did with escape velocities. 
Beyond saying ""Gravity slows time"" they have no formula for time Dilation yet. Nasa are at this very moment struggling to calibrate Moon time to Earth time because time moves faster on the Moon and as I say they do not have the maths even for that so they utterly ignore time dilation in cosmology.
My Theory I call ""The ongoing bang/continuing inflation"" essentially combines the fluid dynamical nature of time with the effects of gravity.  Entropy. Whether gravity slows time or time is gravity the symptoms are by definition the same or both can’t be trough (Note it is an effect not a force).Where time flows slower then everything vibrates slower so entropy increases thus slow time attracts matter. 
Imagine an ‘A’ road with an over density of traffic all moving in one direction, This over density has been caused due to something slowing the front cars, now a second volume of traffic moving much faster because their speed has not yet been slowed catches them up so now you have a grater over density caused by nothing more than relative speed differentials.
As always on a cosmic scale everything has to be considered relativistically, if the presence of mass (gravity) slows time then it follows that where there is no matter then time is flowing faster than say in a dense stellar cluster.
The cosmic egg shells of galaxy dense space around “Cosmic Voids"" demonstrate that as they get empty of mass relative time speeds up inside them gravity has had longer in them than at their shells thus the gravitationally attracted matter accumulates upon encountering slow time.  .
I consider the recent LMC survey to be usable for a topographical time map of the LMC for the first time giving us a causal effect perspective in their search for dark matter; they have given us a usable topographical of the time interactions.
If Galaxies are Vortexes' fed by the external energy environment and not essentially Just a consequence of the ""Conservation of Angular Momentum "" physics', then their maximum creation speed is not limited by the time needed for gravity to gather then compress matter.
If a huge ""Space /time (Sorry I prefer Gravity /Time) Whirlpool in the Vortexes and currants of gravity time carried that mass in then its maximum creation speed is only limited by the Magnitude of the force and it's subsequent carrying capacity.
My theory would predict: (I have suggested before ).
Any powerful ""Vectoral"" (Linear, call it?)  flow will induce ""Ventarían""  sub streams to be sucked in along its path thus magnifying its carrying capacity.
It is counter intuitive that the high pressure  bottle neck of a flow increase's its own pressure rather than rejecting extra mass by it's Speed constantly creating a vacuum around itself. Dragging (Space /Time) in.
Cavitation or secondary acceleration is my mechanism for Dark energy which as part of the overall 75% energy of the Universe is best visualised as the Global Maritime tidal patterns and vortexes.
A submarine leaves a trail of “Vacuum Bubbles”, these cavitations are caused by too much energy hitting the environment  so when they suddenly close that is my secondary acceleration.
Cavitations in Spacetime (Quantum Voids)are the reason not only for the acceleration in the expansion of the Universe but why the acceleration is itself patchy.
Dark mass (I refuse to call it matter) is the simple consequence of M=E/C2 simply proof of its movement.
I consider the application  of my theory to ""Singularities' to be the biggest ""Paradigm"" shifting aspect of it. As gravity increases time slows until in a singularity it stops. When time stops everything stops; Entropy, pressure , heat (Vibration )they are in fact the only locations in the universe at zero Kelvin. These Stopped time zones fill some volume of the area inside the Event Horizon and may someday explain the differences between large and small Black Holes. 
James Webb Telescope can't image Black holes not because they absorb light but because they are too cold for its sensors, which have a minimum reach of 4 Kelvin .(what ever the actual temperature of an Event horizon is would apear colder due to time dilation slowing our perception of the rate of vibration) All I do is apply ""Thermo dynamics"" to cosmology."
what do you need to know about our universe? what are wanting unlocked?  i have the key to the Abyss. you think im going to have to use it. or do you think humans can stop lying? this is what killed jesus/ jealous ppl. lying to the king to the point he just got sick of the jewish ppl up his as. so he crucified Jesus. and God was going to remove all of humanity and save his son. but he gave his life  and told his father not to. that he had faith in humanity to stop lying and become. well Gods in themselves in a way. by becoming designers of planets to become a multi planet species. it is a long road. but i know it can be done. but as i tell Elon robots are better adapted to space and can lead us into doing just that. space is very dangerous for a bio species. best to have something ready using robotics over human deaths.  its going to be epic. to the moon woot. h3 h3 h3 h3 lmao
"Beware, I know what it is  like beyond event horizon.  Take the speed of sound which is  as finite as a speed of light. If you go supersonic in  a plane and thunder strikes behind you, you will never hear it! if you emit  sound from supersonic plane backwards to a plane that goes subsonic, your sound will never reach the subsonic plane! You are beyond event horizon in terms of sound, so there is no way you can hear anything from subsonic plane and vise versa. And the same paralel works with the speed of light. This time however you swap the sound with light.  So this time it is not the sound that cannot be heard, it is the image/ the light that cannot be seen.  That is why black hole is black, If you went superluminous speed in a spaceship  and looked behind you would also see total darkness despite the fact that the stars are there behind you. Butthat DARKNESS is a mere optical illusion triggered by the finite speed of light. The stars are there..Slow down to subluminous and you wiil see the stars again!  That is the event horizon, my friends. Sound pararel again, slow down the plane to subsonic and you will hear the thunder, only backwards. Conclusion- Space and time deformation seems to be just an optical illusion triggered by the finite speed of  light. If the speed of light was infinite, there would be no black hole and event horizon! Black hole would look like gigantic star and there would be no space deformation visible for this deformation does not really exist.  This deformation and time dilatation is a mere optical illusion triggered by the finite speed of light."
So who is pulling the levers behind the curtain?

"What is really tragic is the human being spending so much money on that bullshit having so many problems here. These guys with such ""brilliant brains"" would end up global warming in 15 minutes. Billions spent on things that are useless to mankind. In the words of Einstein: 2 things are infinite, the universe and stupidity."
"if Space is just that ""Space"" eg not solid ...then how can there possibly be a hole in it ..? ....its like saying there is a hole in the air that we breath"

"One always sees images of a black hole head on, so it's physical dimension is always a surface area. Can its volume be close to zero, so the third dimension would be the Plank dimension or smaller."
Black Holes are just Vacuum cleaners of the Universe.
"In Indian philosophy, the word ( Shabd) is Brahm ( eternal) and emphatically stated! It reverberates here in the discussion as well. How profound thinkers were there when technology was even scarce. 
I love your explanation, prof Cox!"
"Well you guys are so very ignorant to our Historical past .Before the great flood most of the Atlantian Aristocracy left Earth to two Planets in Alpha Centauri they had prepared fr thousands of years , ever since they come visit some of us in the past confused them with Gods, Angels until the mid 40s we chase them with fire power. They have made contact with a few heads of State in the last decades and was all kept secret by us. There is Cosmic Law ,they cant intervene in big scale due to our Karmic evolution, they too Answer to the Great Lords in the Universe,its mainly the Hybrids and the Synthetic Aliens that risk breaking the Law."
This video is a Masterpiece on this channel..
"At the center, it rips through space and you enter another part of the universe...?"
we know gravitational waves pass through us all the time... does that mean that all Physics work beyond the event of being faster than light?
Exactly. If you look for answers just look up. The same patterns. Also inside every us. Astrophysics and psychologist are coming together. Halleluja. Det var da pa tiden.
Black holes are not eternal prisons. The best news ever. Bad families are not eternal prisons. Many did manage to escape. And cut off toxics of their lifes. The hardest thing ever. But worth every try.
Thanks. I'm starting to understand. We are on the brink into something. Whatever comes ... we've longed and waited for it. And some were working hard on it. And still do. Wooooow!
I wish they wouldn’t use the dramatic annoying music my brain is trying to understand
Black Holes are other Civilizations and the information within them is like the Library of Alexandria
"I don't understand why these guys want to achieve to understand all of this while ignoring the question ""what is the purpose of life""?"
Intresting video enjoyed it from start to finish 😊
"why do they still call them black holes? quark star would be more accurate and were created in the early universe as a result of direct collapse. this hawking radiation comes from the outside not the inside, no entanglement, if there is entanglement it only exist on the outside. i don't think anything gets in or out, probably the hardest surface in the universe and can only be penetrated by another quark star and the only thing in the center is just more tightly packed quarks. solar mass black holes are just heavy neutron stars."
"There is a problem though.  Even if you were able to assemble everything about an object you destroyed, including its energy and particules, you still have to deal with the chaos that time and interactions between particules and all forms of energy have created.  How do you recreate something from total chaos at the atomic level?  I see only one solution; time travel.  And i don't believe that to be possible.

Same problem for me when you talk about anything falling into a black hole.  Even if the black hole absorb everything, it still remains a chaos 'force' that dishorganize everything, to the molecular level.  Even they admit that at the event horizon, a particule swap from existence to 'anti-matter' or none existence part of 'space time' as we know it.

There is also something they don't seem to talk about here; the fact that black hole do send back their energy in form of a canon of energy sometimes (depends on their level of energy i think) and that is not out of bound of our space-time continuum (our normal space) but very much into it.  So for me, black hole seems to be more like your ultimate shredding machine that spin chaos back from organized mass, into absolute chaos, shredding everything back to fondamental elements of energy, a monster of mass that fall on itself because of the nature of space itself.  Mass cannot escape gravity so only the energy can and will be expulse eventually...leaving only mass without energy...maybe that is the actual origin of Dark Matter..."
Black Ho’s😂
dr cox lost me right now with ad shit
"It is impossible to see inside the singularity, it is a secret that will always be hidden from us."
"Had the pleasure of seeing Mr Cox on his Horizons tour in 2022, right after we started receiving photos back from the JWST. He had an incredible HD screen for which to view these new, stunning images. Between his talk, and seeing those images with such clarity, it allowed for one of those beautiful moments in which I realized how infinitely small and insignificant (or significant) we really are. It was an amazing experience. Brian Cox is a treasure."
He's a better teacher than a writer of popular science.
He's slowly becoming a lesbian.
I absolutely love brian cox. He is the science communicator I have ever seen
Keanu reeves my boy what you doing here
"If it all has to reach singularity in order to eventually be turned into radiation, doesn’t that mean only one particle that came from that singularity could hold all of the information from within the singularity? Meaning in theory you shouldn’t have to collect all of the particles to read the information"
I’d say the black holes (Super duper duper massive) exploding is the Big Bang.
It's hard enough to comprehend there are humans this smart let alone what goes on at/in a black hole
He looks like Keanu Reeves
"Black Holes are easily, by far and away, the most profoundly interesting things in existence. They are entities that seem like something that shouldn’t exist. Something that confuses even our most precise understanding of the universe. They seem like an item that was modded into our game without understanding the rules first."
"Looks like we still don't entirely understand a lot of things beyond what we can observe from the blackhole. At least we have some inkling about the blackmore but at this point in time, we are just barely scrapping the tip of what appears to be an iceberg."
"Bright as a button..

Interesting and informative. 

Blew my nut apart listening to that"
We’re all like the book
"It's called theoretical physics for a reason. No explanation actually exists. We still aren't able to even define what the word ""time"" actually means since time in the traditional sense does not exist."
BLACK HOLE IS A STORAGE HARDDRIVE BACK UP TO THE UNIVERSE GALAXIES ESPECIALLY QUANTUM DATA
ITS IN THE RADIATION BRIAN ALPHA
I love black holes
Let’s just say it’s God and be done with it already
"God created everything we see or cannot see , what we understand and cannot understand ! It’s normal not to know, like what is a black hole , in the same way it’s okay not to know God at point  of time but to just deny God is not there because you’re a scientist is just dumb and irrational ! Just believe in God just like you breath the air and cain’t see it !"
My obsession for anything related to space has come back again so I’ve been watching videos related to it 😓.
"Cox💪""but you f**ing can see it"" 😅"
"He became a legend with his BBC wonders series, I have the book also which he published on it, he is a proper science popularizer."
The problem is complicated but is this related to the apple theory?
"Saying I'm not a fan of Hawking Radiation would be the kindest way to put it.  One particle is inside the event horizon and the other is not. It sounds just way too super convenient, but the had to solve the lost information problem anyway they could."
I don't think that time is even relevant for the universe because if it is eternal in space and time then it's just of importance for us humans
"If  a black hole event horizon allows two particles to become entangled than we should ask whether two particles can become entangled across two different universes. Can one particle 'boil off' into another universe or, alternatively, exchange locations? If so, how would you detect it?

If a black hole has a measure of entropy proportional to its surface area, ie the area of it's event horizon, then surely the universe does too.

This would mean information would be lost from this universe leaving a measure of error in collecting that information."
Please give this man his own talk show.ans he can be the only host and guest 😂
"I'm still tripping on how the universe made them after the big bang. 
 But what you said about them being finite...Whow! That really twisted me...I mean bad enough to learn most Galaxys got 'em at the center, but they ""die""? What the heck happens to a galaxy then??? Ouch, my brain hurts.
 Thx, good vid."
racist
"Im no scientist, but I predict a black hole is what will end earth. It may already be doomed by disease or nuclear disaster, but the full end sure could be black hole annihilation"
Professor Cox's definition of a black hole as a place where the escape velocity is faster than the speed of light just clicked a lightbulb on in my understanding (sic!). Thank you. I get it now 😊
"This video is amazing! I have always believed that time truly doesn’t exist and is a man made thing. I have also thought that black holes are truly the answer to everything. I believe black holes are like a portal or the worm holes we pass through in order to travel to other dimensions. We would just need to figure out how to condense ourselves to a particular to be able to pass through. In our conscious existence this may be completely impossible but what about the spirit or soul? We have all seen lighted particles of energy leave a human body after the body dies, but the spirit or soul kind of flies off, typically with other lighted particles of energy. So our spirit or soul would be a small enough particle to pass through a black hole? This would also grant us access to return, in “another life”, as we all hear of things as an old soul, etc. And there may be many other sides. This would also explain other life forms/UFO’s. Seems like a long way to travel to be here for just a few seconds in the sky then gone. Maybe they are using black holes to travel here? I don’t know…just things I think about. Came across this video randomly and I kind of feel validated a little."
ALLAH HAS MENTIONED ABOUT BLACK HOLES IN HOLY BOOK OF ISLAM QURAN. IF ANY ONE SERIOUSLY WANT TO LEARN I CAN SEND THEM THAT VERSE
Holy guacamole wowza 🎉😊
Blackholes are the engine stabilizers that hold together the fabric of spacetime in the universe
"Always a fan of Brian ,always surprised me he was not more popular in the states he was everywhere then Tyson just took over n popularity blew up ,love em both but Brian is that calm patient,Zen , teacher"
"""Black holes"" are made up nonsense"
Black holes are just new matter / time we can’t see or describe to understand
"prof. Brain cox, always amazing"
Nasdaq please buy title 0:12
So Brian what makes you an expert on black holes?  No one has ever been in one or through one or even seen one.  All your experience is theory only.  Or work with Elon and get your a*s out in space and prove your theories.
"I had no interest in physics or anything having to do with the universe. I heard this guy speak because my wife dragged me to one of his lectures. It’s safe to say I have over 90 bucks on Brian Cox, and the great physicist of the world and space and time. Amazing what one manthoughts and opinions can do in one hour"
"Maybe that's how the Big bang happened...the death of a black hole, The singularity gets so hot and dense that it explodes creating another expanding universe"
Where does Gravity goto at the center of a Planet
Oh my God now I understand now thank you......
"Black holes. Is that like

So soothing to listen to this scientist. everything he explains is so understandable.😮❤❤

"In the center of the black hole. It has more energy than its outer surface. Means when u look at sun in 50 degree in center you can see a black dot. So when singularity point is more powered than the outer temp, energy and light"
Such a fascinating topic to listen too thank you Brian !
Hawking radiation is dark matter. Heard it here first!
💽😬
"Believe it or not but all the words that he has spoken are words of 'The Truth' written in all the sacred books of every religion here on earth. To those who have the 'wisdom' to understand, they will see 'It' wherever they go or whoever they listen to.
Wisdom (Insight) is power, not knowledge."
he looks like keanu reeves
"By the way, love your site ♥️"
"Maybe like a giant recycling machine that sucks everything in until it's done, and then when there's nothing left to do throws it all back out again."
Brian Cox is almost poetic in his narration. He's like the English version of Carl Sagan.
"Brian cox...The 21st century`s Carl Sagan (to be clear, I mean a hugely clever person who is able to communicate complex scientific data and theories to thickos like me)"
Effing love Brian Cox
"It's amazing how Mr Brian Cox can speak so eloquently about the universe, and we hang on every word, trusting it without a second thought hopeful we're not all doomed."
"my theory, very absurd but here we go,
everything, every single thing is made up of particles, tiny tiny particles and that's to involve feelings, abstract ones as well, our ""conscience"" is a cluster of even smaller particles we cant fathom, when we show kindness to someone and they feel it from afar or two steps away its these little particles travelling there to create a chemistry in the other person, love, hate, jealousy, they're all particles it only makes sense that this is so because we are made up of stars and whose to say that when we collect this small and even smaller particles together from the blackhole when cant somehow get to know what history of us there is but even precisely how a particular someone must have felt. when we die we become one with the galaxy our conscience merges seamlessly to the universe, we are the source, we are the universe"
Woooow. The singularity being a point in time is crazy to think about given the theory of the heat death of the universe with most matter ending up in black holes
"I don’t understand how him and I are the same species.
I’m not smart.
I have to listen to this dude multiple times to even grasp a basic understanding of what he’s saying.
And I could listen to him all day."
"This is very interesting. In order to understand the black hole and singularity, we need to gather up all we know so far, but also accept that we might have to change some of these theories and learn a lot more new discoveries. This brings up the idea for question about real science fiction …so far, but what if we could able to learn How to control or form the singularity in to certain place, so theoretically we can choose when the time is not moving forward. Don’t take this too seriously, but if we could be in some vessel surrounded by this force where time has stopped, but outside of this force we are travelling with the speed of light to another galaxy, for example 10 000 light years away, Now the question: Could we theoretically erase spend years by controlling this singularity force, and arrive to this another galaxy instantly of our time?"
Such a genius!
"Interetsting stuff and all but i'd love to know what the significance of that is.
If they manage to get a unified - or to get this quantum theory of gravity, then what will that result in?
E.g. for non-physicists like us, we look at black holes, astronomy all these amazing things and go. ""wow - that's amazing"". But it kind of ends there.
What will happen once they've unified relativity and quantum mechanics? Will it mean more than just a ""wow""?"
"Consider Black hole as "" Totally internally collapsing object"" or a black star , instead of emitting photons it is absorbing them and then apply science to it, every calculation works now"
"What if the black holes are some sort of gateway that are so dense that you can't see the other side explaining the reason why light can't escape? 

What if black holes as mention are "" the end of time"", were recognized as the end of our time and the beginning of something else.  Unfortunately I'm not sure we'll ever know due to the fact that we would have to deliberately send something to a black hole and measure everything during the event. 

That being said, if something were on the other side, hypothetically, that it's gravitational force is much larger and nothing possess the amount of velocity needed to escape once in that gravitational pull."
"I saw him live yesterday at Royal Opera house, was compelling - I wanted to throw my pants at him, but apparently that's not a thing.. yet! LOL"
"I believe that it all restarts again with a black hole 🕳️ Everything has to be destroyed and mixed, to restart life again. Whoever or whatever built us, gave every single thing a birth or a beginning day and death or end day, including stars. We are not meant to know the secrets of the universe. It would interfere with how we humans interpret reality."
Who knew quantum theory could be so poetic.
"Brian have never seen any type of hole, that for sure"
"A great move wpuld be to stop calling them ""holes"" if gravity is due to mass then it is an immensely dense solud object... youre own limited perspective (and understanding of how gravity of this strength affects light) is the only reason they ""appear"" as a hole..."
I can listen to this man all day long.. .need more of him..
"This video just sparked an idea in my head. What if black holes are where universes come from? They fill and fill for billions of years, until BANG!! Brian mentioning the center of a black hole being infinitely dense is what triggered the notion.

Brian reignited my passion for physics about 12 years ago. When I first discovered him while watching his series Wonders of the Universe. It's an absolutely brilliant watch, that I couldn't recommend more. The only other man that made physics so understandable for the layman was the legend Richard Feynman. It's an incredibly rare gift. But the voice, in that regard Brian stands alone. Just wonderful to listen to."
Interesting fact several small holes marge an become an big hole an we are finding key to check both side of hole some says the hole can broke by some universal code but the holes merge so politely that an big holes create an sounds that sounds can make holes in any kind of earthy materials an it is 10 times biggers than earth ( the hole) know come to my point sansatan dharma says when our earth will enter in this hole a new earth will appear an a new era of species on earth gravity is constantly bringing the hole closer to earth there is only one way either we protect the earth by anymetal or we should move earth more hear to there some small aestroid will occur in other place but we can be protected by the holes
Could the Big Bang have been caused by a reverse singularity?
Came for answers going back with lot of questions
The problem is we will never get close enough or go inside one to really see and understand it. Therfore there are some things that cannot be known only theorized. You can guess all you want but we will never know for certain what happens in a black hole.
Understanding black holes could explain the mysteries off the universe! Screw that .. find something closer to home that will make us understand each other first ! This planet I think would be better off with out us !
"I struggle with the idea of a black hole ""swallowing"" another black hole. 

If a massive black hole (A) approached a smaller black hole (B), does the pull of (A) not gradually take matter from (B) as its influence increases, therefore reducing (B)'s mass steadily, such that it will eventually reach a point where it is no longer dense enough to form a black hole? Would we not essentially be watching the formation of black hole (B) in reversal? At some point, will (A) not reveal the entire contents of (B)."
No one knows about it.
I realize that black hole is actually a massive force that bending time and space in circular patter and it is not siphoning stars but just pulling the photons is the cause of tearing space and time surrounding it
"I ain't tryna trip but lots of the science community can't see the forest for the trees. This is my take. When formed black holes create a crease through spacetime to an empty pocket universe and deposit initial matter...then it seals up. Over the course of the black hole's lifetime, and through subsequent merger events, more and more matter/data in deposited into the pocket universe. Somewhere around supermassive attainment, the black hole reaches critical mass... And blows the crease wide open. By this time the pocket universe resembles a massive conglomerate of primordial soup centered on the crease/white hole. When the black hole reaches critical mass a big bang event occurs within the pocket universe. I got more ideas too concerning this, and to me it fits together like South America and Africa > plain as day. Astronomers will say it doesn't fit our understanding, and I'd argue there's so many gaps in our knowledge that sometimes you have to make obvious assertions. Wouldn't it make sense that the largest single objects in the universe are responsible for the biggest event we know of? Also a recent study suggested that, the initial moments after the big bang, there were tons of tiny black holes. Just saying. Hope all is well."
What if information isn’t conserved and it’s just a process of entropy?
"blackhole in physics is...

physics put into a logic viewpoint in the same way as to put logic in parameters."
🇸🇬😏
Death is a mystery so we fall into a black hole to discover what death is and of course it remains a mystery…
This man needs to be protected
Tiktok set back the progress of mankind by lord knows how much time.
This 2:40 has to be the most mind-blowing and simple explanation of what a Black Hole is ..
Space facts are really amazing and Brian Cox is so good at explaining it well.💫💫😎
"Honestly, I'm not the brightest person. This really, really interests me. It triggers something deep in my body, my mind; that wants to know, wants to understand more. Brian Cox, you are amazing."
"I solved it, wasnt hard"
Are you the Gate Keeper? I'm the Key Master.
Amaya
Is gravity time
If mass exsists
Whar if like electrons there is no time
Nothing but fiction do not even know how the universe came about
I could listen and learn from this guy all day
"brian cox hole is bigger than these black holes
just saying😂"
Ssohpkc
Black holes 😂 stop it
You are the only one to explain what is global warming and how people will die. Better explain the effects and how it is created and what would happen if there are any to survive. Other things are immaterial. The hot topics of today's natural disasters.
"So, the implication that our universe arose from emergent spacetime is possibly that the universe resets part of itself every now and then."
Every video is a masterpiece. Keep doing what you're doing!
"Hell I know turns out that Black holes are just massive blenders, blades are made of time and space"
Is he explaining the existence of God
Why use miles in a science video?
You start off saying it’s all theoretical which means Black holes don’t exist
Consciousness is fundamental.
I could listen to him every day.
Brian cox explains this for the average person thankfully
"It’s absurd to think that any human knows anything about a black hole. And yes… to finish that statement was a full stop. We know nothing!. Nothing at all!. Be quiet!. Give it another 1000 years and hope that human civilisation still exists, and also hope that we may know a tiny bit more so we can say facts. It’s a dot in a sky through a telescope!. All of it is!. Shut up!."
"Correct me please if I'm wrong: a black hole is not really a hole, but a body, like a star or a planet, that has a gravitational pull so immensely strong that nothing can survive it or escape it and everything gets just sucked in by it and destroyed into dust/particles. Right?"
"Stick a go pro live feeding to a screen on a rocket, and send it in one lol"
Brilliant.
I click on everything that has these two words in it: Brian Cox.  Amazing intellectual.
I talked to u
Amazing
Big thinking about Cox and black holes. What could go wrong?????? 😅
"SH radiation does not remove energy from the black hole.  It adds.  It converts matter into energy.  This eventually causes a white hole explosion over time.  SHR removes energy from our observable universe.  Think about it with logic, not a narrative.  Narrative: information, time, laws, reality, and reason behind formation."
in an infinite existance one must surely consider the large and the small and therfore the similarity between a solar systym and an atom.
"Quantum This, String Theory That...Blah, Blah, Blah. BUt we believe Brian is Correct on one factor; Define Precisely What Is Inside a Black Hole and it's Dynamics, and it's highly likely we'll get closer to Defining How This Universe Actually Works.....Most Likely, HOW IT BEGAN."
Something or things that these Physicist all believe is true...is not. Until it is realized we go nowhere.
I find it ironic that pollution has helped us come to such astounding conclusions.
"Return the ether theories, you can explain everything with it"
Entity live in 10th dimension or higher & fine tuned universe.
"can any one explain me  when two planets having same mass with R distance between them , which one attract other like sun and earth .... and if you are saying no one can attract each other  and they are in steady condition  then also explain it ...  let us suppose a two ball like earth and moon and consider moon as same but earth mass same as moon then what will happened in this case means i want you to think on the density of the two objects.... because i think that a object is not limited to which you are see their circumference but the space out of that circumference it has also mass like our various layers of surface of earth  (troposphere and stratosphere ) ...... please shear this question and give mi a perfect solution."
Thank you- have learnt a lot from you- especially about space time.
"it is interesting that everything that has ever been and everything that will ever be, no matter how complex, is present now just in uncoordinated particles.   Like my great grandson exists RIGHT NOW, every atom that will make up my great grandson's brain and personality exists, but just in smaller more split forms."
"If someone here can answer: can a black hole implode in our univers, but also elxplode in other, (only my interpretation)."
"Brilliant, a guy that understands something well enough to explain it to people who don't know that much ::-)"
Brain Cox and Terrance Howard need to meet and have a conversation
This blew my mind.
Blackholes have an event horizon?   Do objects only  go thru on side.  Is there an event vertically. What if two stars get sucked from opposite sides.  Or is it just a black sphere. ?
Lawrence fishbourne already went to the event horizon and it didnt work out very well for him
This guy is full of BS
best video ive watch bro thanks
I've no true understanding to some of the jargon he ust shared. But this was incredibly moving to watch. Space and Time are one of the most interesting mysteries of life itself. This was so beautiful. I'm glad i came into contact with this today.
Just ….wow 😲
I really want to talk to this man I have a theory and somewhat proof things are not what they seem in fact quite opposite to what we currently know
He 8
Black Holes? How do we know anything about these alleged black holes? Science could be way off on what's really going on with them.
"Black or white wholes...
I dont mind both."
The best explanation so far.
black hole are caused by human being
I just watched the movie inception; and now here I am….
To think this guy failed university and then was funded by the bbc and along the way brainwashed folk
"what if all the matter that falls into a black hole gets turned into space-time at some point? the matter is converted into spacetime and its energy conserved - would be a good source of dark energy/dark matter perhaps?

If you could get away from the extreme gravity and destruction you will get time.."
Can he Explain an Black hole to begin with or? Maybe i look for someone different that has an degree in something except YouTube..
OH!! Please. Did he just say we understood physics??? OMG we rely don't...
"Before the Big Bang or so we did not experience time it just passed 1 sec. or billions of years .. The enormous gravity we have NOW was the predicator for time it self. The only time you can see Time it self is when traveling fast enough or have an high enough gravity to make your own time. so the higher the speed you travel the greater your mass will become, the less times you seam to spend in that moment. Just simple"
Ofc with out Gravity you don't funking get time...
I thought he was keanu reeves😂
Perhaps mass is not constant while volume of space decreases in a black hole it Could decrease by a much smaller amount but still prevent an infinite density occurring.
"This man is incredible, I hate this shit, but with him, I could listen to it for days"
"This scientist is one of the most delusional ones.

If he cannot prove it for certain that black holes exist, therefore, there is no deal. 

Speculating is no science.

These people are feeding on funds and most scientists are marygoarounds.

He is BTS army in the thumbnail 🫡
We are all just living in a vacuum’s world 🌎
I think Brian has smoked too much weed.
The reason why we can’t see black holes blows my mind. What’s happening there is traveling faster than the speed of light. Black holes make me think about what happens when you delete something on your computer permanently. There’s no record of that thing but there maybe a record that something was deleted…but the reason to delete if it was to make more space…then black holes are needed for the universe to expand. Sounds like a portal that returns things to eternity.
Thumbnail looks like dude that went and got the cutting implements 😅
I smoked salvia and man it reminds me alot of this
Love brian cox man
The heavenly black hole!
"Hahaha stupid.... Space is fake and so are all the photos. Just lights in the sky and they move and twist, try a Nikon p900 and zoom in!!!"
"Brian Cox is brilliant, the way he explains even a child can understand"
"The way in which Brian Cox articulates his explanations of all things science, not limited just to the discussion of black holes, (and their mysterious nature) is a flawless, grammatically perfect way that is simply unprecedented among public speakers."
"Brian cox is one letter away from looking like an American country musician. Brian Fox, the haircut…"
Lucky will be the generation in which the entire mystery of the universe will be understood. Another century or 2 perhaps?
"Brian Cox adds passion and humanity to abstract concepts such as quantum physics.  Had he been my physics professor, I would have probably become a physicist- albeit a YouTuber one."
black holes are where u find aliens
The video thumbnail 🫰
I don't believe that gravity is infinite at the centre of black holes because if black holes are born from stars then they start with a certain amount of mass therefore have a certain amount of gravity.
Time and space are illusions. This kinda messes up this guy's gibberish theory !
Sooooo much of what B. Cox has made a living talking about is complete BS
Lmao.  Would love to have been there when joe rogan was told there is no such thing as black holes 😱😱
Lol here after Terrance Howard on JRE.
"The idea of emergent gravity is a fascinating possibility. It would require a paradigm shift in our understanding of gravity, but it could also lead to a deeper and more unified view of the universe. While it's not the mainstream view yet, it's an area of active research that could hold the key to unlocking some of the universe's greatest mysteries."
Terrance Howard already has
Respond to terrence howard
So was the start of our observable universe or big bang just another black hole coming to its end?
So Terrence Howard says black holes don't exist because you can't take something OUT of the universe. I agree. He says gravity is an after affect of electricity. I urge anyone with an interest in science to see Rogan's podcast with Mr. Howard. So much food for thought. Cox and Tuyson are close-minded. We need people to test Howard's theories.
All just theories mix with imaginations..
"gravity is only a result of electricity it is not a constant.( rub a balloon and put in on the ground it will pull the dust particles off of the ground defeating the gravity of the entire earth) look up Terrence Howard, he probably knows more than most scientists. He also talks about why modern science can't merge general relativity and quantom physics.  Our  formulas and theories are fundamentally flawed. There is no straight lines in the universe."
Amazing stuff. I love this kind of thing. I’m too old know but I would have lived to study this
Fascinating concepts explained beautifully - amazing video
"Why is dark matter not absorbed by the central black hole and the millions of black holes in the galaxy?
Although DM doesn't interact with normal matter, it interacts with BH, right?"
This is both incredible and terrifying.
"Black holes are a great metaphor for some defeatist types.  But they rely on space actually being warped by mass/energy and not just bending trajectories like any other force.  The latter seems more logical, but I know we like fantasy."
No tears but it safe to say we all cried from within. Goodlife to all those people who are scientific or rational in life. More knowledge and wisdom be on your way.
I think it should be called black potholes not black holes because black holes mean that the other side is open while that is not the case.
"Could listen to the guy all day Haven’t got a bloody clue what he’s on about, but I’m sure it’s fantastic!"
This kaneu reeves twin is super smart
"Thank you Mr professor 
You’re perfect every thing"
Brian Cox is such a GOAT
I’m waiting for the black hole sun to wash away the rain since the 90’s
"Let's explore black holes. According to Einstein's theory, matter cannot be changed to nothing. Equal input = equal outputs. A star creates light, the black holes absorb it. The star creates light from energy. So a black hole is not the end. It absorbs energy and it has to excrete it somewhere"
"9:18 Now that black holes are confirmed to exist from the very beginning of the universe and some think of it as a simulation, what if black holes are a data/information collection point for whomever is running the experiment 😳😎"
"Ich habe auch das große iPad Pro in Gold mit weißem Rahmen, genau wie deine Frau. Das war mein erstes iPadPro überhaupt und es läuft heute wie damals sehr gut. Heute ist es das Familien iPad mit dem alle Netflix schauen oder ein paar Spiele laufen lassen. Wenn ich das jetzt in die Hand nehme, ist es noch immer schnell und flüssig. Danach kaufte ich mir ein weiteres iPad Pro mit Stift, aber das war nicht signifikant schneller und ist in den Besitz meines Sohnes übergegangen. In der Retrospektive war der Neukauf schon damals nicht notwendig, denn egal wie schnell die neuen iPads waren, es blieb eben iPad OS und wir verwenden auch meist dieselben Apps. Vernünftig gesprochen, war der Neukauf eine überflüssige Ausgabe. Aktuell kaufe ich kein iPad mehr und bin zurück zum Mac, mit denen ich mehr anfangen kann."
Just leave the fuck en music out of it. Goddamn why is what he’s saying not enough
what if the black holes are our universes vacuum system that take all the negative particles and shoots out positive particles
Black holes scare the hell out of me.    :/
Mankind may finally meet God. 🥲
I love BC but it’s only really exciting if you are actually there to collect that information from the black hole when it finally dies. In reality any black hole that ceases to exist will probably take millions if not billions of years to happen.
"I am stupid, so honest question. If nothing can escape a black hole, why are there particles coming out? And does that mean these particles travel faster than the speed of light?"
A black hole is the universe's recycle bin
"Our own miscommunication of development still a hindrance to think universal, it confined us as slaves or converting people to become slaves in a new way, as humans collective we don't have goal about the universe or else about this planet Earth."
"Thinking ahead about blackhole is most negligible, thinking about crossing the boundaries of this solar system is most important, so we fly out mind ahead of moving our presence there , as child new born. So what causes it is our brain and body which has to learn everything from the beginning, even any genius born on this planet is only for the period of time. So in future we may have to change our physical body as whole May be the future environmental changes can induce change of this, mental condition of future generations must be like that they don't have to learn everything from the beginning, or else we have to progress like that. Then only what is dreamed is possible. The knowledge about the universe is present in the past and now it has most articulated by media. Then they use what ever at their disposal. We must have taken intiative."
"This guy's been around for awhile, I like him"
"This is a late night thought but here me out… From the perspective of a piece of matter falling into a black hole, time slows until it reaches and exponentially decreasing speed toward zero. So, from the perspective of the physical matter, it never actually enters the black hole. Now, from our perspective we witness the physical matter travelling into the black hole at an unbelievable speed. So there is already at this point a clash in realities - the one seen from the perspective of the physical matter falling into the black hole and our perspective as we witness the event of its demise. The physical matter is trapped in endless time and we the observer have witnessed its demise. Now imagine a third party witnessing our universe from outside the universe. Perhaps they have already witnessed our universes conclusion as we live in what appears to be infinite time. Does that make any sense? 😂"
"can a black hole outlive the heat death of the universe, was the big bang a black hole releasing"
"Wow!
Explaining complex theories in layman's terms is an art!
TAKE A VOW"
"i actually know how they emerged Brian and im not even studying about it ,P not joking either"
"Just a thought, if one of a  pair of entangled particles fall into a black hole , what happens to the other particle?"
"any ideas about what happens inside a black hole are just assumptions, since nothing can escape from a black hole to provide us with information."
"Black holes are hole in fabric of space, everything goes in inside blackhole will go to another universe so called multiverse and all the Galaxies are moving because we came out of black hole. Whole universe is thrown away from massive blackhole. Black hole does not have any kind of mass it is just hole in fabric of space 
(Just my Theory)"
What if the waters that expanded the universe were a black hole as you would imagine it. And the point of singularity was a single atom? ⚛️
It's an everything beagle.

Space and time emerges from God... The Biblical God has all the properties of the mysterious origin of space-time
"Is it like the quantum computers, the particle is somewhere within the bounds, but you are not sure?"
"I think we should follow the mathematical formalisms of General Relativity as well as Quantum Mechanics.

QM formalism indicates we live in a multiverse where all outcomes are equally real, but not all are equally likely.

GR formalism says we live in a static block universe, where the passing of time and free will are illusions.

Unify these ideas by saying quantum mechanics is the multiverse model. It somehow gave rise to an infinite number of fully formed static block universes, each unique in some respect. An infinite number will seem identical but will sooner or later diverge.

This means you can't get quantum gravity because gravity is a property of universes, which emerge from quantum theory.

Asking quantum to describe gravity is like asking a baker to make you a donut with no ingredients.

General relativity can't explain singularities because they're through-holes in the block universes. The 'center' of the black hole is timeless and spaceless because it's actually a hole into the multiverse in this kind of thinking.

It's like asking what flavor the hole in the donut is.

So, information falling into the black hole would be shredded from tidal forces and probably other extreme conditions, and be out in the multiverse somewhere, beyond our reach. Not lost - just lost to us - like whatever is beyond our light-horizon expanding away from us faster than light. Who knows what's there - they're not in our light cones.

But it would mean information is preserved in the multiverse.

Multiverse not having space or time in any way we're used to think of wouldn't have gravity and no black holes of their own, and no known mechanism of information destruction.

I cant verify any of this but its what seems like it fits best with what little i know right now. And i would be very surprised if what i cobbled together in 3 days with no training would be correct haha."
by black holes i see een afro lady bending with no pants.
"There are certain people who you would love/hate to be stuck in a lift with for a few hours. Prof Brian Cox is definitely in the ""please don't fix the lift"" category!"
Does that mean the so called end of time has been happening ever since black holes first started? And would that then help to explain the infinite universe thing? Oh fuck me I'm way outta my depth!
"Imm not smart but i like to think of black holes as bubbles that suck in matter till the point till there they cany suck in ant more matter, like how a fire cant burn with out oxygen... thats my view on black holes live with in black holes till they eat each other  but if everything collected could it be part of a super black hole that grows as every inner black hole dies??"
Why does this guy look like a mixture of Keanu Reeves and Justin Bieber
So basically time and space are irrelevant if u can make anything from gathering and conjoining certain particles?

How do you know someone knows what they are talking about they are able to explain it to others in a way they can understand thats Brian
Good
It’s God
"So my question is. If a black hole is a moment in time and not a point in space. Does that mean that we are slowly heading towards a universal black hole as time goes on. Does this eventually mean that all of the contents of the universe converge on a point, and explode thus leading to something like the Big Bang? I have 0 idea how to explain this but this was an immediate thought I had."
"Imagine we can figure out a black hole but, not how to stop killing each other?"

"There is nothing more attractive than an intelligent man. Add to that Brian Cox just being DAMN HOT and yeah... UGH so attractive haha. If he wasn't married I'd be like, ""I'M A MATHEMATICIAN! CALL ME!"" haha :P"
Do you have any idea what you're talking about?
"There's nothing really mysterious about a black hole. They already know about neutron stars which are neutrons packed together and that generates enormous gravity. But neutrons are not the most elementary particles. They can break down further into electrons, protons, etc which can't be broken down further. So if those elementary particles are packed together you would have the most intense gravity well possible in the physical universe where not even photons can escape. All this quantum and relativity physics explanation is just math not reality and there are no absolutes in reality."
"Brian Cox was a part of my childhood, and he's now a part of my adulthood. He's remarkably good at explaining stuff."
"Like this crap is going to help anybody in any practical way.  Astrophysics is a hobby and not practical science.   Astrology is more practical than astronomy as people can buy books on gardening where astrology is used to give a proper schedule as to planting and harvest, as well as processing in between.   Nothing more practical than growing food."

"Instead of thinking the signularity is, within time dialation in relativity, the end of time in this sense, my question is Could the hawking radiation coming from the singularity/black hole be the source of time instead of the end of time? Instead of absorbing time, could it be expelling time as energy? IDK, its just food for thought lol"
"This video delves into the fascinating concept of black holes and their significance in understanding the fundamental nature of space and time. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics, provides insight into the historical origins of the concept of black holes and the challenges they pose to our current understanding of physics. The discussion on the event horizon and the singularity within black holes sheds light on the complexities of these cosmic phenomena. Overall, this video offers a thought-provoking exploration of black holes and their role in unraveling the mysteries of the universe.

The idea that space and time are not fundamental, but rather emerge from a deeper theory of gravity, is profoundly exciting. This concept, known as 'emergent spacetime,' suggests that there is a deeper underlying theory from which space and time arise, possibly through quantum entanglement or other smaller components. Black holes, as observed objects in nature, force us to ask sharp, well-defined questions about the nature of space and time. By delving deeper into the nature of the Universe, we may catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden - the deep underlying structure of reality itself. While no one knows for certain where this journey will lead, the pursuit of understanding the nature of space and time offers a glimpse of something truly beautiful and profound."
Best person to ever explain a complex subject regarding black holes
just talk without  bits of video clips you make it so boring cheesy if you can't do that give up join a band
Stupid question: Can you test radiation like they do with carbon dating?
I saw Brian cox the first time on Joe Rogan pod cast. It was awesome. If you haven't seen that definitely watch it. I enjoy listening to Brian Cox. When he comes back to the states I would like to see his show in person

Black holes are the gateways to parallel universes.
Guy looks terrible. Lying constantly does that to ya.
Nice Cox
Can hear Brian talk about space all day
Does the speed of light slow down when approaching the immense gravity increase that is evident at the event horizon?
"I use to play with my ex's black hole, felt creamy."
what does quantum entanglement have to do with emergence of time and space..? (mentioned 10:50)
"Man, Biran Cox has got to be the best science communicator today. Reminds me a bit of Carl Sagan, and he would have been a much more worthy host for the Cosmos reboot than Tyson."

I've been listening to Brian Cox to go to bed for years now. He's an awesome dude I gotta say his soothing voice just gets me right every time.
Monads. Leibniz.
"True science noses as a dark star, the guy who named it knew it was a dark ball, but he called it a hole anyways and it's not even black because it's different variations of dark hues. It really depends on which one you're looking at, and the gravity so intense that no s*** nothing can escape it not even light so, that would make sense. it's a giant ball of Dark matter, makes sense because dark matter is made from supernovas, makes even more sense at the center there's even a more bigger one (the original sun that supernovad), and just because we can't see the light that's in it doesn't mean it's not full of light, it's just too heavy, to have any of it escape. So please after a billion dollars,  ( & too many decades) later can you folks please call it for what it is a dark star and not a hole in the f****** universe. It would really help out for people to know that's not actually a hole, but it's actually a thing (physical matter) that their brains just can't wrap their head around all that easy (but on the other side is the same universe because it's a ball) (like how balls work). Not that hard to understand. What's really hard to understand is trying to wrap your head around something that doesn't even exist. I wish life wasn't this way. I prefer more options and better truths. This doesn't even cut it, none of this does, not even close. And don't take it too personal I'm talking about society as a whole on this side of the Earth. Great shame. Well many societies in general, Great Shame."

"Sigh, time is man made"
"Correct me if I am wrong. I thought that quantum mechanics meant: If you observe it, it changes?"
the escape velocity part explains why light cannot escape a blackhole so elequently
"Question for Brian Cox.
In the simplified explanation you did on how the Hawking radiation works, you said that one of the virtual pair of particles fall in the black hole and the other particule scapes. But those particles are 1 particle and 1 antiparticle, so depending on which of those particles fall into the black hole, it will add or sustract mass from the blackhole. The net effect shold be zero. Am I right?"
"I want , first of all excuse my ignorance, as I am not a physicist. But have a question. As we have never seen a wormhole  in the universe, is there any possibility the black hole are indeed themselves wormholes  that attract matter from one place and “ spit it out somewhere else” in space? Thank you I’m only a hairstylist so pardon my stupid question, if it is so!"
Brain absence of time is origion of space
Black holes are nothing but trouble
Found this guy in my backyard groping my apple tree. I honestly have no words right now.
i think black holes and pulsars are the keys to the universe
What if everything that fell into a black hole is only reappearing at some point in space time… like some portal to the future or past
Does Hawking radiation only exist when black holes are holding on to one of a pair of entangled particles?   Does it/can it exist in other places- maybe around supergiants? Can it be detected?

Every time after I watch Brian Cox or Neil DeGrasse Tyson I’ve come to the conclusion that I’m missing a critical component in my brain to understand any of this….
"I could listen to Brian Cox for hours, not only because he enables us to catch a glimpse of progress being made in cutting edge physics but also because his enthusiasm and his insatiable curiosity stimulate mine even further."
I can't be the only one that finds this guy is a twat. Science has thrown it's reputation out the window the last handful of years.
"Given the predictive nature of gravity and its relationship to mass, of how matter interacts with this in a proportional linear manner, evident by how we observe the transition states of matter for example by reverse engineering the life cycle of stars as they birth the elements of the periodic table, the subsequent order of matter all proportionally exhibiting densities and intrinsic energy and mass values, whose states of being transfer to us the information necessary to transcribe how they came to be as a result of a star’s lifecycle, all of these processes indicate that there is a defined gravitational threshold which establishes the boundaries for the form/states that govern what will or can become of matter, it is logically coherent to extrapolate that a black hole is the quantum particle converter of the base state of matter in its most fundamental form, recycling the foundational building blocks of the cosmos herself, like a digital pixel particle quantum ‘vacuum sun’ ultimately sustaining the vacuum state from out of which the gravitational state and light are sustained as merely emergent properties/phenomena of the vacuum state, arbitrated and sustained, by quantum physical particles. What is perceived as the vacuum state may in fact be a quantum ether of sorts. Now the kicker would be that as visible matter is recycled into its quantum birth state what is the mechanism by which the quantum state coalesces back into observable standard model particle physics. It may well be that there is in the future of knowledge a mechanism by which this takes place some sort of dark energy plasma or interaction or, is this the state into which the observable universe will decay? This, may explain why the universe is expanding to ultimately evaporate into a cosmic expansion of quantum particles who themselves will, when the material elements of suns have been entirely recycled into their base state, and there is no longer a frame of reference against which they themselves can expand, - will collapse into a single point of energy and rebirth a new cosmos? Or Not! 
Given that matter can neither be created nor destroyed then it follows that matter is an illusion into which we are delusional observers of subjective illusions called the standard model and the consciousness of mind is a preprogrammed mechanism to assert the ‘reality’ of persistent delusional illusions from which we make assertions out of the madness of chaos, and this whole thing is a ruse or trick, or a simulation of some kind for the comedic entertainment of a superior intelligence, as they watch Iddy biddy humans make sense of the cave of their sensory illusory limitations.

"10:15 - so the Star Trek transporters were in essence, creating a black hole out of a human each time they ""energized."" ...."
"First of, stop pronouncing idea as idear, it's very annoying and takes away all the attention from the subject matter.

Secondly hawking radiation is BS because if the particle anti particle scenario even is true, the other way round will also happen where the universe loses a particle worth of weight into the blackhole"
2:28 😮 bro I never thought this
"If black holes dissolves after a while, leaving just hawking radiation:
after a while, the only thing the remaining black hole would have to eat, is itself and its energy output, which in turn should make it dissolve itself, which kind of leaves us with what I can imagine is the same thick, dense soup of just loaded particles we have been theorizing what is '' the universe before the big bang''.

Not my original idea at all.
It seems to fit the model of what we seems to actually know and see about this Universe we reside in;


IF, big if, a black hole can eat everything except itself/the thing it radiates and eventually dissolves as a cause of, what we are left with is ''just particles, packed together in 'some' space'', no?
The rest seems to be apparent history, already, as it turned out....this time"
"Christ Brian cox , just says the same things all others do. Has he event came up with anything successful aswell?"
"It's insensitive to say Black Hole.

Where to hide the deepest secret? Either in a place impossible to reach or in plain site that requires impossible perspective to perceive something in an way that seems to be impossible on a fundamental level.
😢 the fact I cannot grasp this makes me cry
Black holes aren't real
The Quantum Theory of Gravity.  I’m getting some more digital universe vibes.
Why does Brian cox explain and make it seem simple when in reality it's the hardest thing to understand
Outstanding explanation!👍
Could the big bang just have bin a white-hole on other side of a collapsed star?
I'm happy we have great minds like Brian Cox. Without scientists like him we would know next to nothing about our universe
"This was a very good way of saying the modern thing, which is quite old in fact, we don't know"
"Deeply hidden is another way of saying we don't have a clue about it. The very same thing a cave man thought half a million years ago, when he or she was wondering his or her surroundings. We just know now the world is very complex and beautiful, the very same thing they already knew back in a day. They thought it was divinely beautiful, somebody came up with this idea of God. That's impossible, right? 

But what is God, if it's not logos. Logos in its standard meaning designates a word, speech, or the act of speaking.  Logos in its special meaning refers to the special revelation of God to people. In Christianity, the Logos (Greek: Λόγος, lit. 'word, discourse, or reason') is a name or title of Jesus Christ."

"If Steve buscemi and Keanu Reeves had a kid, this could be his twin"
"The fundamental clash is ( we think ) & ( we believe) the fact is that we do not know. Prediction is a mathematical guess. Unless you can touch it see it and measure it, then everything is a mathematical guess."
time is a concept. but at the same time we can age at different rates through gravity... so then its reality. Mind-bending shit
My mind is blown
That part about space and time being an emergent property from something deeper and hidden made me cry.   I am so moved by this video.  It is so beautiful.  Thank you.  The mysteries of life unite us all.
Miles per second!? Hasn't Briant heard of the System International (SI) for units?
When it's dies could it not just be another big bang
He explained very gently. I never understood the things he said before until I listened him. Amazing
I was in a black hole once but I was able to escape it's grip.
If Brian Cox decides to take your woman then she's gone forever 😢😂
We want more Cox!
What if the black hole is like a time sink and all of the particles will be free not in the same place but in the time (past)?
"I have often wondered if black holes are like where the universe is  continually sucked into many black holes and the big bang is basically where energy built up in these black holes explodes ( our big bang) and that if we accept that is a infinite cycle of waste distribution? 
It happens everywhere on earth so why not our known universe is just that ?"
"I love astrophysics and from time to time there are videos that take me to an ""out of body"" experience <3 Thanks for another one of this kind !"
Black holes are empty. Gravity wells. And that's it. Their biggest secret is that they are not fully in presence. They are blurred in Time. All best to my favourite tutor! 👾
"A black hole could never completely disappear, eventually, it would lose enough mass that it would cease to be a black hole and stop emitting Hawking radiation. It might even turn into a star once it loses enough mass to stop grabbing the light that wants to leave and enter the universe."
"A black hole's core forms from stellar explosion, but mass capture causes the black hole to rotate.  The rotation must cause the event horizon to rotate; this compels the fall of mass from the event horizon inward to be ""more"" tangential and less radial.  This reduces the condensate density of mass on the surface of the black hole compared to the core; it allows for evolutionary alloying crystalization from the surface inward, with accompanying piezoelectric consequences within ""the skin"".  The question becomes whether some black holes are spawned with enough gradual time before being swamped by mass imbibement, that they can develop such high spin rate, that the event horizon spin rate becomes high enough that the trajectory of infalling mass becomes radially tangential enough that a space gap is created between the black hole core and the later forming ""surface"" shell (""Dante's Inferno""?).  If so, such morphology would have a tremendous capacitance sufficient to act like a bug zapper upon mass approach within dielectric breakdown distance.  The incoming mass would likely need some static charge, and atmospheres would tend to enhance this.  Does the James Webb Telescope find any evidence of brilliant arcing from black bodies apart from polar jets?"
"i don't know why youtube recommends stuff like this, black hole is no different from earth or any other celestial body. it's just that humans are primitive and human mind can't grasp the simple fact that black hole is a sphere like any other, it's not an actual hole. it's just compacted matter, which causes high gravity. there is nothing to ""unlock"".

if only primitive humans would have more common sense ... it's so easy concept to understand.
for example in order to turn earth into black ""hole"", you'd have to compress matter into about size of a golf ball."
"In my youth, I was the co-director of a public observatory. But this discussion is all new to me."
came here for hannibal lecter. who the fuck is?
I have my own theory on how Galaxies and Black Holes came into existence. Feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong. After the Big Bang explosion thousands of dark Super Vortexes were created. Acting like space Tornadoes attacking Space Matter. With no friction in space to impede their rotation they sped up at a tremendous rate. The huge Vortexes which we now call Black Holes in turn pulled in the surrounding space matter to form the spiraling Galaxies. Many scientists believe there is a black hole at the center of each Galaxy. My theory would also explain why all galaxies are spiral.

"- Where does does everything that went into the black hole go? 

1. It becomes the core of a new planet.

OR 

2. A new star is born. 

You are welcome for my Theory!!! 

To understand the answer...ask yourself the following questions (these questions are just a few to get you started...): How big can the center of a black hole get? What is the lifetime of a black hole?  Where does the earth's core come from? Where does the sun's core come from? Does gravitational pull decrease over time? How much can the fabric of space be stretched and does the pull decrease over time? ....there are many more questions which lead to MY theory on how a planet and star  is formed; leading to a Solar System, leading to a Galaxy, leading to......... keep going..🫡

Everything in earth and space is a pattern. 

Sometimes the answer is very simple."

You’ve betrayed humanity for wealth and fame. 👹🌍🐍
I’m my mind black holes will keep forming until there’s nothing but black holes devouring each other until another big bang and everything will start again in a completely different way
"What I don't understand is how a black hole's gravitational pull is so strong that light can't escape it. Yet, there are particles that escape a black hole. Those particles are radiation, correct? If that is true, then a black hole doesn't suck in matter and light. It merely converts matter and light into radiation."
Thunderbolts Project¥
This was a wonderful video! Especially why light can't escape a black hole- it was very intuitive.
Super interesting!
"If the Higgs boson gives matter mass and gravity is the interaction between space time and mass then isn’t that the answer? Wouldn’t the Higgs boson be responsible for gravity? And since particles are so unimaginably small and their mass is so little, the nuclear forces overcome gravity? Idk I’m just a person who watched YouTube videos"
"After 50 plus years of work, Brian is an entirely new view of every thing. Unlike Hawkins and Einstein, Brian makes it easy enough for an old man to understand. Thank you Brian."
Amazing
"As you fall into a black hole staring outwards toward the universe, you see all the stars and galaxies start moving away from you at increasing speed. This is because the intense gravity causes time to slow down for you so eventually, a fraction of a second for you is millions of years for the rest of the universe. You see trillions of stars form, get born and die in giant supernova explosions like a celestial fireworks display as eventually the last stars twinkle into oblivion.
So, yes you will most-likely get spagettified and die. But not before you've seen the rest of the universe end before you!"
Kind 🎉
Students are lucky 😊
"""Nothing can escape not even l..."" ""Don't fuckin say it"""
Maybe I'm crazy but I'd happily jump into a black hole just to see what's in there 😃
I've always been fascinated by space and time and all of those things and Brian Cox has a really cool way of explaining things and he's got a cool way about him
I did not understand how information is conserved I mean before the big bang information was zero and since then the entropy of the universe has increased which implies that information increased.
Brilliant piece of explanation.
"Brian Cox is the most eloquent physicist. When I listen to Neil Degrasse Tyson my brain hurts, but Brian explains everything in a beautifully simple and understandable way."

"brian has more  intelligence in his little finger than most humans on this planet.  a big call but just, wow.  love his thinking."
"Information is conserved. But only in ordered systems - the equations that Brian mentioned.
But... Theoretical physicists are so deep inside their research that they forget that just because something is theoretically possible, it doesn't mean that it is possible in the real world."
"Dear Prof Cox

I would love to hear if there is a theory where the black holes are witnesses of the big bang.
I imagine after the energy release from the Big bang, some tidal movements from the blast is possible. And so I imagine, this could be an answer why every galaxy has its own one. And those other galaxy eater black holes could be the first witness of the big bang.

One day I will understand how a particle created outside of the EH would take energy away from the inside of black hole. Wouldn’t the black hole still be getting larger since the particle on the inside still went in? Nothing has actually come out so why would it get smaller. Sigh. To be smart enough. I do try though!

I'm grilling AI chat on black holes right now. Thanks Brian.
We will never know cause we will never visit one....90% of what we know of black holes are just theories.
I think Brian Cox has unlocked the mysteries of the universe cause he’s looking younger as time goes forward.

No disrespect but when it comes to space and black holes all I hear is a lot of smart talk about nothing... we will NEVER know the truth until we actually go out into space and explore.
One of the best black hole videos I’ve ever seen
WHO WOULD WIN OUT OF FIGHT 👊 🤜 💥 BRIAN COX? 😀 OR NEIL TYSON? 💩
Glimpse of something deeply hidden
The black hole near the earth is a planet NEBIRU
"What can I say, simply fantastic…"
Shouldn't gravitational waves and frame dragging around rotating black holes provide key info about what spacetime emerges out of???!!!
Doesnt the Plank length prevent a singularity???!!!
Am I the only one to notice black holes and big bangs are the same thing?? I’ve been saying this for 30 years.
Gods amazing way of showing those in the science field that He can create such a baffling natural occurrence- it’s truly fascinating
Black holes matter. 😮
"According  to Quran, Humanity will never ""unlock the mysteries of the universe"" unless God permits it"
Imagine wasting one minute of your sad life on this fake crap
"Is a black hole actually a hole?? Wouldn't it just be a very dense object, dense enough that light can not escape the gravity. I just don't understand how it becomes a ""hole"" if it does."
Am I the only one who thinks that Brian cox looks like if john wick was a scientist?
Who is your class
Laplace mainly think about speed and negatively plan
Any idea planet formation
"I didn’t know Keanu Reeves knew so much about black holes, wow"
"If the video of him & his producer hadn’t leaked a few years ago, with him learning his line is the car I would believe him.. but now.. not a chance"
"Thanks for the video that's really interesting. I have a question though maybe someone could enlight me. At one point in the video, he says that it's possible to perfectly rebuild a book that one has burned or destroyed in any other way. To me we have a problem with entropy which keeps increasing here and makes the process of destruction irreversible.
I'm not to familiar with thermodynamics maybe I'm wrong about it or this has nothing to do with thermodynamics. 
Thank you again for the video"
Lord Shiva ...all of this reminds me of
i’m drunk n this video of him made me relax and find solutions to my problem (s)
God is real
"I can't come to terms with the idea that particles coming spontaneously into existence near the event horizon of a black hole, and then leaving as radiation, could somehow lead to the degradation of the black hole and eventually the loss of its mass and density. Can anyone point me in the right direction to a resource that adequately explains this phenomenon?"
"Black holes remind me of compost bins. You put the material in and it transforms into building blocks for something else. Fertile soil.
Remarkable spark and curiosity, he has. Contagious. 
Brilliant."
It’s a wig !
I call you the young Carl Sagan. Please continue but please open your mind to something even more on a spiritual level.
"There are IDEAS and Questions raised, however the ENTANGLEMENT theory is such that background radio-waves simply became ACTIVE and mineral gases formed to create NEW FORMS  and hence development of planets in SPACE and planets in Galaxies etc etc"
"I believe that we live inside a hypergiant black hole. The 'Big Bang' was merely the birth of this black hole, and the Great Attractor is essentially the gravitational force or the point of singularity or some shit pulling all galaxies towards it. 🧐 Please comment below on why this might be either correct or incorrect"
Love to see him live
Listen mate living in the 3rd world shithole that is England these days I'm more concentrated in just getting through yet another shit week where the only black holes I'm experiencing are the ones at the  petrol satation or supermarket.
the way Brain cox explained…wow
"I am not a physicist, nor a scientist.  I am a simple retail employee in California.  But, if entanglement happens near the event horizon of a black hole and if, as professor Cox suggests, black holes have a finite lifespan, then could a black hole become large enough and live long enough to pull in so much matter over it's lifetime, that it could eventually collapse on itself again and then detonate as it did when it first went supernova?  And if we have not observed or do not have the tools to measure such an occurrence, isn't it possible that our universe was once itself a black hole?  If true, could there be other similar black holes that have spawned other universes?  If so, because black holes bend the fabric of space time, isn't it possible that we simply aren't able to detect these other universes because the space time in these universes don't overlap?

Professor Cox is far and away my favorite scientist to listen to."
If you go through a black hole i think you will crawl out of a alien kids plug socket and we are his computer game. Just a thought lol.
"I have a theory, if anyone could enlighten me if this is actually interesting or just stupid that would be great. What if, we entered a star just before the exact moment it collapsed into a black hole and escaped with the information it carries, this would not only solve the information paradox, it would also tell us what is at the center of black holes and possibly give us the theory of everything."
"If anyone wondering what the name of the piano song playing at the end its 'From Small Beginnings"" by Jay Price"
Beautiful video.
WHAT THE FUCK! Please have some mercy on my brain. Wow!
Its the Kingdom of God that You can Not See with your Human Eyes!!!
This is really cool! I enjoy listening to Brian Cox explain things that otherwise I would not have understood
I don’t fully understand “Removing energy as it goes.”
Nice to see keanu reeves knowing these things
I thought they were talking about Kim Kardashian..
"Did Brian Eat Cox unleash his wild, expensive imagination again ?  🤣"
"When l hear Black Holes l can't help jumping to Naomi Campbell & Grace Jones, and I'm pretty sure neither of them are gifted in the science department."
The visual aid really aided.  Thank you.
Wow. He just described teleportation.

"It hurts my brain, what happens if you go into one and not die, where do you go? What happens?"
"THEORIES ABOUT THE ""BIG BANG"" AND ""BLACK HOLES"" ARE ILLOGICAL.
There was no Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago and Georges Lemaitre's theory is illogical.
1. What was before Big Ben? No logical answer.
2. What powerful gravity concentrated 2 billion galaxies (30 years ago scientists said there were 100 million galaxies, in 20 years it will turn out that there are 10 billion galaxies) in one place? No answer, there is and has never been such a gravitational force in the universe.
3. Is there life beyond our planet? Yes, but are there intelligent life forms? Here the probability is 100 million times lower. out of approximately 100 million different forms of life, from bacteria to dinosaurs to blue whales, only one organism, i.e. humans, acquired intelligence by a complete accident.
4. There are no black holes - Black Hole. Stephen Howking theory is also illogical.
The most important force in the universe is gravity. For billions of years, stars, planets, moons, meteorites, comets... everything that occurs in the universe have been heading towards the center of the galaxy, attracted by gravity. It is not a ""black hole"" but a mega-giant central planet, millions of times larger than our sun, that has cooled down and therefore does not emit light.
After billions of years, the Mega Central Planet will attract and concentrate all the matter of the galaxy, unless it first collides with another, larger Mega Central Planet. It is assumed that in a few billion years our Milky Way galaxy will collide with the even larger Andromeda Nebula galaxy and after billions of years, as a result of gravity, a Giga Central Planet will be created. This is how gravity works.
And I emphasize, I am not arrogant, I base all conclusions on the analysis of available information and logic.

Get a life ffs😊
"black holes are a name we've given for a phenomenon that we think our science can observe, and from it assume to theoretically explain more about it. For the time being, what we call ""black holes"" are only able to unlock the mysteries of our imagination. If and when we actually know what this phenomenon is, and what it does, it may in fact be something entirely different than we now imagine. It may be something and it may not"
I think black hole just take the disorganised entropy things and then organise it and then release it

Beware of gravity 😢
We are actualy in   black hole
"I have a love/hate with these videos… he explains things so well that I leave thinking “oh I could be a theoretical physicist” when in reality, I probably, could not lol 

Amazing content"
More beautiful than a god would be!
Aliens bigger than our planet exist out there?
I want to know if a black hole tears the fabric of space time which is at the end or the other side of a black whole.
I'm about halfway through Black Holes. It's a mind bending book!
Brian Cox could be Keeanu Reeves' brother. Just me?
has anyone considered that since gravity may pull or move space and time faster than light that it has reversed both and may not exist as a result?
I think by 1000 years we would have a clear picture of real black hole with mind bending truths about it
Brian cox is my dad
Please Stephen Hawking come back and save us from the keyboard player.

"Why are you looking for traces of life? Millions of tons of sand are probably not enough proof for you.
what do you want to look for with black holes? You're already frightened when you see it."
Black holes aren't black holes they are flat discs they flatten outwards into space further wide it's not a hole at all. That black hole is your antimatter flattened out space from dense matter cancelling its self as matter into antimatter...
"You could express the same thing in ebonics, and it would have a different meaning"
Keanu reeves if he was a scientist instead
I know many scientists are atheists but I feel these discussions right here is god staring us in our faces. It’s so unknown and unexplainable but life is so complex and I personally believe this. Life will always be some how some way and we will exist forever somehow because energy doesn’t die
They are doorways to  GODS WORLD
How can they be the answer to what's going on what ever goes in doesn't  come out
"I'm clearly being an idiot here, but if we ignore all the probabilistic stuff, which depends on inputs rather than data, then we have a misnomer about entropy. The heat death is not the most disordered state, it's the most ordered possible state, an equilibrium tells us exactly where everything is, because it's no longer moving. Information, learning, knowledge, data, is all disorder, it's the application and imposition of rules over a state. Those rules impose disorder, a disorder that we gain energy from, that we apply to random facts to turn them into knowledge and coursework, by imposing on the eventual and inescapable order of all bit and bytes, of all neurons, of all photons as they eventually pass into the equidistant space between other photons, which is by definition the most ordered state they could find themselves in"

Every time I look at Brian Cox I wonder why that 12 year old has so many grey hairs
i love black holes
Nothing new here woopsy dooooo
We need more people like Brian Cox !
he also claimed finding the higgs particle would answer all our questions
Brian is a gift to science & understanding.
one of my favorite humans
"We all live in an Electron Universe without which Atoms could not exist. My vote is to study Electrons and Gluons which hold all the matter in the Universe Together. Black Holes are formed from 2 Neutron Stars coalescing at circa  >2.2sm. Neutron Stars are made of Neutrons. Electrons and Protons. When Neutron Stars form they eject all heavy elements like Gold Palladium Carbon etc. We see this in the stellar remnants of Neutron Stars. So from Neutrons Electrons and Protons Black Holes are made. There are therefor only 6 possible combinations of what a Black Hole is made of. Electrons and Protons can exist in Equilibrium. Electrons and Protons cannot exist in isolation, Neutrons cease to exist without Electrons or Protons. So Black Holes can only be Electrons and Protons in Equilibrium. This combination produces no Photons (light). It produces no Magnetic Entanglement which eliminates Black Hole Quakes. Both Neutron and Magnetar Stars produce magnetic field entanglement quakes. And Black Holes spin at speeds where normal matter would disintegrate. >90% LS. I like the Changeling Quark as it can become what Quark it likes. This Quark represents the Physics reason that there was probably no Anti Matter in the De Coupling event at the start of the matter Universe. The Changelings became what ever state suited the preservation of the Quark Universe. If 50% of quarks chose anti quark there would be no matter in the Universe. @ 49.9 / 50.1 there would be a Quark deprivation to form Up, Down and Changeling Quarks. The Expansion Theory in the Big Bang is not needed. If you think of a basketball size effervescent ball placed into a tank of water only the edge in contact with the water goes through a phase transition, or De Coupling. The Matter Universe came about from such a De Coupling. Therefore the Matter Universe could have developed by known Physics in the Scale Factor over a few billion years. This would also mean the Matter Universe came from a significant amount of Equilibrium Energy circa 6 Billion Light Year Diameter. Again working within known Physics."
"All I know is black holes are super tight so you gotta start off by going in slowly. Once you pass the event horizon, depending on the black hole, you might see a discharge of brown matter which will ruin your journey. Your goal is to reach a nuclear explosion of white matter before coming across this brown matter. You got to stay singularity in order to enter multiple black holes. It looks like Brian’s Cox has entered black holes before so has mine. 🫡"
This man is the new day Carl Sagen.
Brian Cox is a genius
"Every single video or TV show that Brian Cox is a part of, is just simply mesmerising. Explains things in such amazing and beautiful detail, it's not something that anyone could ever get bored of."
Wouldn't that reconstruction of information be some sort of rewind in time?
Maybe thats why we have dejavu..a black hole just collapsed... atleast from what i am hearing and seeing..  it seems like it coukd be a very strange interesting possibility that could come from that and we just cant understand it yet.... who the hell knows with all this mind blowing amazing phenomenal things that happen in our universe and all its different unique mind blowingly interesting and strange things that exist in the universe
"I have a few ideas for possible solutions for dark matter/energy.  If they're wrong, would you mind telling me why?

Dark Matter solution (possibly?). What if the missing mass isn't from more atoms? Since interaction with the Higgs field is what gives things mass and that's due to subatomic particles. What if other places in the universe have higher numbers of subatomic particles per atom, or different ratios of subatomic particles that interact with the HIGGS field per atom? 

Could there be subatomic particles outside of atoms interacting with the higgs field, in a ""non-visible through radiation"" cloud in inter stellar/inter dimensional space, throwing all the models off? 

Alternatively, or additionally, is it possible for those subatomic particles to exist in the centers of the galaxies, or even black holes, without being contained in an atom?  Or, if there's missing mass in planets, perhaps it's in the center of them? 

Related to this, black holes are supposed to be infinitely dense because gravity crushes everything infinitely small once a run away density is reached, yet the argument underpinning the ""big bang"" is that matter was crushed to closely, which created too much heat and energy 

Another idea: what if something stretches, or HAS stretched the HIGGS field, particularly if it happens unevenly, and thus differing interactions with it we see as gravity ""not working"" are just stretched in the Higgs field, like gravity warps space time?  
Also: If we don't have an explanation for uneven stretching in our universe, could it be from something occuring in the other dimensions predicted by string theory? I've also long wondered if some of the ""missing"" impact of gravity that I've been told happens, is due to it being stretched acroas multiple dimensions, perhaps some ""dark matter"" is this gravity bleeding back over from other parallel dimensions, possibly with the Higgs field as an intermediary somehow????"
5:36 stephen got turned away from an orgy hawkings
Could listen to Brian talk about space all day
"From beginning of BigBang to the end of the universe.
From beginning of Blackhole to the end of Hawking Radiation.
Are... Implications... Nature... Reality.

Quantum Information and Quantum Entanglement are Fundamental.

Quantum Mind emerge.. Collection, Pattern of QuInfo and QuEntang.
Quantum Body emerge.. Std.Model emerge, DNA, Protein synthesis.
Mind and Body entanglement.. Consciousness emerge.
Spacetime emerge.. Mass.. Energy.. Wave fn. Decoherence.
Mathematics Emerge.. Intrinsic in the fabric of the emergence.
Holographic principal..Information Conservation, Energy Conservation"
So what if we send a person or something inside and make the disappearing process of black holes faster like in a few seconds? Can we save the person or the thing inside there.
"Oh these scientists and their BS… They don’t understand gravity
They don’t understand electrons 
They do not understand the physics of space 
They don’t have a clue… 
I watch these guys and laugh..
I mean saying the Big Bang created the universe is the same as saying the earth is flat. You ppl have no idea and never will."
"There's always the possibility that the true nature of reality exists beyond the comprehensive capability of absolutely anything that is capable of comprehension. Either quantum gravity theory found the end of our knowable universe, or humanity and technology will evolve one day to be able to find an even deeper unanswerable question."
The key? Read the Bible. The Bible is the key to everything.
"Interesting! I don't know about black wholes but to me, existence was always there.  It will never end, cause it never started. We could talk about if it is conscious or not, or as einstein said, ""freindly"". But, matter, live, particles, waves, black wholes, are derived from that eternal mystery some call God, name it's pretty useless. So, it's no necessary to be real, as we understand real, it only has to feel real, that's why we don't understand time and space, cause, in the end it's not really there, but it feels like, if we vibrate that slow. It has to be experiencied it can't be understood."
"Brian Cox is a great communicator but an average physicist.  Black hole fill our ignorance. Only hypothesis advanced as hard true. He believe that life came from inorganic stuff 3.8 billions years. Not surprising he don't believe in God, soul and so on."
Brilliant
Bedankt
What a total idiot?

"If Hawkins radiation slowly releases over time, will the black hole not become less dense, and so at some point, light must escape at an ever increasing speed?"
Knowing all this won't even get you one more breath -it's all chasing after the wind. The wisdom of the wise is foolishness to God when compared to what awaits those that love God.
"Not anymore. There is no singularity according the latest amd greatest disruptive information from the good old James Webb

"Black holes contain all we don't know. It'sa concept. Period. No experiment has prove something valuable 
Like geneticien call junk DNA  the 95% of the DNA we can explain.

How can there be Hawking radiation when the black hole’s gravity is so immense.  Wouldn’t that mean the radiation is travelling faster than the speed of light?
"Brian Cox is the Sir David Attenborough  of physics, give us more of him.

We've all got a black hole.
"wait... if outside of the black hole, time still works, in the inside, if the time stops, is there anything still working at all? or is end to everything, at last in the 4 known dimentions?... X, Y, Z, and Time? does ""time warp"" or ""blinking"" on a, let's say exact calculated spot in space, does that has any effect on the time? or is just be in a complete other area if the gakaxy, in a blink of an eye? where does the time goes? what about the time factor?"
He’s an amazingly beautiful human (mind body and most importantly soul) and I pity anyone that can’t see that
"my son is just 3 years 5 months , he always talks about black hole and he is very much interested on these things . Every time he ask me to put Tv to learn about solar system , asteroids and collisions. Nebula ( which I even don’t know )  and galaxies .He wants to know more and more about black hole and nebula . Not sure what’s going on him. Better I want to take him with best astro physicist. He don’t like to watch or see anything apart from solar system . Being 3 years 5 month old , he likes you more . Everyday night , I want to tell him stories about universe , galaxies etc . To make him understand I’m learning these topics . Thanks for inspiration"
Thanks Brian
Woah.

Why is water flat?
I never thought that Keanu Reeves knows so much about our universe.
My dumb ass was like dam why he talking about black hoes then I checked again and was slightly disappointed it actually said holes I wanted him to describe black hoes in detail
Ik no one will see this but I thought Brian was Keanu Reeves 😂😂😂
Dear Brain. You are a scientist. Please use the metric system.
I love Cox!
"So does the math show that the max ""size"" any given blackhole could ever attain can be determined by the energy at play during the moment of the blackhole's birth, and that in actuality it will continue to both consume and create particles until it reaches it's theoretical max size and then begin to shrink, while still consuming and creating but at a slower rate post-max size, until it becomes infinitesimaly small and is no longer a blackhole, but rather a black point?"
Has anyone ever considered that the big bang was caused by dark matter escaping through a black hole? In turn causing a massive reaction that created our universe? Of course this means that on the other side of the big bang lies another parallel universe.
Black holes doesnt exist.
Bro looks like Keanu Reeves if he played an asian character in a movie
I’m of the belief that black holes lead to other universes if we had a way to traverse them.
Brian Cox talking about holes is a little too on the mark isn't it?
It is impossible to get tired hearing about black holes. Especially from this man
So is the big bang possibly a black hole that has released all of it's information thus creating life as we know it today?
The title of this video sounds like the best porn ever.
why the heck Keanu Reeves explain black holes to me
My mind was blown 3 minutes in
Black holes don't exist..  No one has ever seen a black hole... It's bs...😆😅
Yes!! More Brian Cox please!
Wow… patterns of deeper connections
"If the black hole loses mass wouldn't it stop being a black hole way before it ""disappears""? Wouldn't it revert to whatever object it was before it became so massive to be a black hole?"
He remindes me of Carl Sagan so much.
What if all that energy the black hole is taking in is being released somewhere creating a new universe?
So many ad's
How do we know the two theories actually do unify with each other? I think there is a hidden unknown theory that allows our current theories to unify I think it’s 3 and the double slit/black holes have the secret sauce how or why or when or where idk!!!
"As you describe de cycle of a black hole,  I was thinking on universal super storms"
How can i find more of Coxs on black holes?
"How can there possibly be a beginning? To me that is the ultimate mind bender .  Even when you consider a big bang or a cosmicly condensed singularity.. there will always be “what was before that?” There is no point where there was nothing before a beginning .  Every few years or so I come back to contemplate on that for a little bit, but it can’t be answered so it’s just a brief mind exercise.  It’s ironic that the biggest and probably most important questions, at least for now,  can’t be answered."
Wow
"if the singularly is the total compression of spacetime and all matter sucked into it just evaporates and taking into consideration the law of conservation of information, could it result into what we know as a big bang, the birth of a new universe, a wormhole of some sort"
He's lost weight since he was in Succession
"Hehe, Cox talking about black holes"
Using miles in a scientific video ffs
"Is it possible we are in a black hole and why our universe keeps expanding and growing,
Black how theory is that a massive star dies in a super nova and that could be the big bang?"
...what about brown holes?
"Brian can go on Rogan, do an outstanding explanation of some scientific theory and how it's arrived at, and STILL leave Rogan completely unpenetrated by reason as he jumps directly into obtuse speculation on the very next show."
You can see how excited he gets about his work. It is beautiful
what
So it's a particle accelerator? 😅
He is so down to earth. I like that about him
"Would this be right if I say,! What if the whole universe is inside a black hole !!!? Make me wonder stuff"
I am here to say he is Keanu Reeves cousin 😴
"It's nice we live in a time where we can think about these things at the very least because we will never find out what black holes really are. At least I don't think us humans will live long enough to figure that out. I just don't think it's in the book for us. But hey, who knows right"
"Why a quantum theory of gravity, why not a relative theory of the quantum"
helo brian i would like to add some insight to the your understanding off a black hole to understand what they are  is to fully understand magnetism this is the key to understanding the complexities off a black hole i am not going to fully explain on here but as you know black holes emit hydrogen which is vhel at its highest capacity so in ecence light is matter and matter is light as the name hawkings radiation may suggest hydrogen which would give a greater understanding off how our universe began unfortunately what quantum suggests what is gravity is acttualy not maybe think in the terms off the erasure off space like i said if you fully understand magnetism then you understand what a black hole actualy is as for space it holds no properties and as time is only a measurement it is to rethink your theories i hope one day we could discuss this further off my findings ....

Can i get the book 📖 that he mentioned
"No offence, but Brian Cox is clueless"
what is the difference between what we observe as a black hole and what you would expect to see if the natural element osmium were to collect into a mass of enough volume to have a gravitational field.  how far from the surface of mass would you need to dilute the density before it reached that of gold.
"I like clever scince,❤"
"That makes complete sense, the burning book analogy makes this very easy to understand. A black hole is like a blender it just takes everything and makes it to its smallest form and spits it out thank you for explaining this"
"Fantabulous, the singularity is not a place in space but a moment in time. The end of time ❤"
Broan Cox presnets  the Black Hole drinking game. 🍺🍻
"The title sounds like a top shelf photography publication.  (Reove tye L and it gets real profound from around the 3 min mark).

what is the harmonic frequency of blk holes and worm holes
black holes are more closely related to worm holes ingesting matter and energy  and seeding the ever expanding universe faster then the speed of light black holes do not disappear they close the worm hole nothing in nature has just one kind of something may be many types of blk holes and worm holes  they may exist together
the black hole could not be a portal to another world??🤔
How do we know that stuff fell in rather than all that stuff we think has fell in is simply making up the Hawking radiation
The universe doesn’t care about time- time is so we understand it. Existence moving forward isn’t time— time is a tool WE use to keep track of it and explain it mathematically!
Theory says we should still see anything that has ever passed the EH like it never did due to time dilation- we see nothing!
There is zero evidence at all anything has ever fell into/ been sucked into a “black hole” nor pass right through.
If the singularity is real and a mass it will keep spinning forever unless interfered with by an outside source. T=tw.
So what these people did is get rid of a person physical singularity powering it!
"If you look at that singularities actually exist, and are spinning faster than light due to L=lw. The EH is the terminator between this object and normal time space. Nothing passes the EH. And there’s never been proof anything does."
"I apologise if I'm a major Dumbass here. but, if this is true about a black hole having a life span, and that everything inside is returned. Could this make a case for the 'start' of the universe?

While typing this, I'm aware that it's not the case, just thought it was a nice idea😂"
This is James Blunts smart cousins 😂
Eres tu  NEO?
"Escape velocity question, for example earth if you had enough of an energy source, why couldn't you just go very slowlyyyy keep going up up up and beyond?"
"So photons cant escape a black hole, but hawking radiation can"
Brian Cox makes my brain hard!!!!
"If nothing - not even light - can escape a black hole, how can gravity?"
when explaining these theories its so helpful to be able to see graphics and illustrations to help understand and imagine the what is being described.
"so Hawking radiation is every bit of information ever. One day everything is inside a black hole. And then? Then ""A Big Bang"" happens"
"So if photons cannot escape black holes, its not because the black hole is pulling on the massless light, it can only be because the black hole is consuming space-time itself. Can a physicist please correct me if I am wrong please. >>> Black holes consume space time <<<"
Ah sh**  wrong website...i was expecting a different video
I love how he explained this! This is the first video about black holes that I've been able to fully comprehend and it made so much sense. 🖤
Sure! Jump on in and let us know what you find!
I've always imagined that our universe was born of multiple super massive black holes colliding and that multiple universes have been born and destroyed via black holes
I also new this as a young man
Black holes? Democratic ran cities.
"Me pretending to understand anything Brian Cox says 

🎱👄👁"
No sh%t sh£rlock.
Why haven’t we sent a probe into a BH?
"Everyone is walking on the Moon. There's ONE SURFACE. I've been outside the Dome, and THE DEVICE that keeps me alive there, is shown being used on the floor of EL CASTILLO. yeah- I'm THAT guy. The 2012 Apocalypse. THE REAL TO YOUR FICTION."
"You can't know what 2024 is, until you know what it's not."
"You cannot say ""Time is"" until 2024 is not your Time. It's like the Color red in the rainbow whose eyes never looked anywhere but at its redness, describing the colors it's never looked at, in a form it never imagined."
"If Time is a frequency, and 2024 your Channel, why have you never moved the dial?"
"Worms have been eating dead Giants and dead dinosaurs for like 4,600,000,000 years, which means humans are most likely a species of worm grown from the Tree's Of Life, now gone, and called mountainous plateau's, and the 1st human worms that fell from the trees of Life, fell like apples with a stem attached to their tops, the ""how"" of elongated skulls. Tardigrades over 35,000 years old have been unfrozen and are alive today. Today there is a worm alive 350 times your present complete life time, and none of that time is present in your 4 digit no comma ""conscious"" moment. 2024 is your TV CHANNEL- TURN THE DIAL-change the channel. LEAVE 2024. TRY 2,024. FEEL THAT? YOU JUST PUT 100 TIMES MORE SPACE IN YOUR CONSCIOUS MOMENT. DID YOU LIKE IT? THERE'S MORE!"
"BRAIN COX CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE 2012 APOCALYPSE IS, EVEN THOUGH IT'S BEEN WRITTEN TO HAPPEN FOR OVER 2,000 YEARS, AND DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY BRIAN BRAIN COX CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE 2012 APOCALYPSE IS? BRIAN OBEYS THE TV NEWS. BRIAN THINKS THERE IS A VOID, AND A MONKEY WITH A HANDFUL OF GRAPES TOSSING THEM AT A CAKE FROSTED SPINNING BEACH BALL PROVES NO 2 OBJECTS FROM A VOID CAN IMPACT A SPINNING SURFACE THE SAME WAY TWICE. There is ONE SURFACE- the Moon's, and we're under a Dome upon that surface, and every crater inside and outside our Dome made on the Moon's surface are made from below by million year old tardigrades- THE OLDEST LIVING LIFE FORMS! Yes Brian, I just made a monkey out of every word you've spoken in your life."
Is space black because it’s a black hole?
"I always love brian cox because he talks about what he knows but makes clear what we dont know. In the beginning he said ""we think"" which is obviously just an educated guess. I cant stand when scientist claim something absolutely that has no way of being proven."
Why is John Michell black in the video? lmao
SO MUCH TO LEARN. NOT ENOUGH TIME!!!!
"I could listen to him speak for the rest of my life, no problem"
"what if the black hole is a one object ; and it's the ( nothing ) who created the universe  . then , ... if we had been to expanding , ... which is look like  have no choice ; so we've to travel through the time to survive , ... you knew ... . 

But , if it's more than one object ; ... 🔎 we've loading ! ... . 😆😂"
Why does Cocks care? Wont we all be dead from climate change by next Tuesday?
I wonder if this universe is inside a black hole. What strange laws lie outside this black hole universe?
Such  baloney. Such arrogance  This screwball should get a real job.
I watched it 2 times already and I am not bored ❤
"The Quran
(21:104) On that Day We shall roll up the heavens like a scroll for writing. Even as We originated the creation first so We shall repeat it. This is a promise binding on Us; and so We shall do."
Brian ❤
Space itself is the source of gravity and source of matter as we view it. Space is the beginning of the all questions to the universe. Space is the beginning and the end though Space is the only stable and constant thing in the universe.
Said a whole lot of nothing . We know nothing. Just fun guesses. Nothing else
This dude looks like such a sex creep.
Black holes are still stars ✨ Magnetic fields generate time. The time around a black star is much slower than Earth 🌎 's star 🌟.
Light does not interact with gravity
Quantum theory and GR will never be compatible as gravity is not the curvature of space time
How could a black hole have the secret to our universe
So may ads.. like come on
Amazing you can write a book about something you cannot even dissect and analyze it. That is the exact opposite of the scientific method.
🤯🤯🤯
Simply amazing. If I had Brian as a teacher in school I would probably end up within the science field.
I am very curious about knowing  universe facts... But dont understand much of  scientific terms ...
Lovely Brian Cox👏🏻
"I'd love to have a conversation with Brian.  You get the feeling you could ask him anything, and he'd be able to explain it, clearly.  Despite him being incredibly smart, he never comes across as patronising or condescending!  Amazing scientist and author!"
really liked him in super troopers
"2.40, my mind just blew"
"Inside of it,time and space are one, outside (where we are, those two are split)"
"I won’t pretend to understand much of what he is saying, but I could listen to him all day."
It's called theoretical physics and when you listen to him first thing he says is I think will that I guess there's no they can't prove they can prove there's galaxies even when or where the big bang happened if it happened in theory they think it all happened from a particle
Time has not been kind to this man for all the information he has shared over the years.
"For more: ""Biophysics of Evolution of Intellectual Systems"" // Biophysics, 2022, Vol. 67, No. 2, pp. 320–326."
They are not fundamental
It has to
"Universul este viaţă, religie dictatură peste utopia morţii."
they help exchange info during  universal mitosis and act as a nervous system to the universe even though its not technically alive just overly complex minerals structures lol
One of my fave scientists along with Michio Kaku. I could listen to Brian all day long like a child listening to a bed time story.
Could would should theory guess bull shit
this guy is a clown
What would u do with this knowledge?
"i forgot about brian cox ... and it took me while to find it back..... ( yea i should be ashamed of myself )


most fine person on this planet 

<3"
It puzzle me where does gravity come from...in a black hole when the star collapse the star collapse it self decrease in almost to nothing so where does the enormust Gravity come from.... if the star almost collapse to almost nothing...
Sienpre tengamos en cuenta antes dela biblia y todo lo que el umano a aprendido ba estar lo que dios o el creador no quiera ensenuar en el futuro el tiene todas las solusiones y respuestas.

When I hear about big black holes I think of Oprah Winfrey!
All these people are making great statements about how great is this video.  The reality is that what is the impact to their lives before and after the video?
I need another beer to help me understand this
this man is one of earths treasures
"Would it theoretically be possible to launch a spaceship into an accretion disk, orbit as close as possible to the event horizon, and orbit there until the black hole gradually dissolves several billion years later, releasing the space ship in the distant future, and the space ship experience it only as a few days?"
’و إنه على رجعه لقدير’ صدق الله العظيم.
imagine the answer to the universe is given in a youtube comment and noone acknowledges it
Ah fuck it. Just say god did it 👍
Without music please
"So this makes me think the following: If you would be able to survive passing the event horizon then time would speed up for you. This in turn would mean that you would see the universe flash forward, time-wise, at an incredible speed. But since we also know that black holes evaporate then you yourself would evaporate. Which means that from your perspective you would see everything speed by in a flash and then you would just as suddenly cease to exist since the black hole evaporated.

We also know that the speed of light is constant and as we approach speed of light room-space warps (if I have understood it correctly). If the escape-velocity of a black hole is greater than speed of light doesn't that mean that light are going faster then speed of light when it falls into the black hole. Or is that why space and time ""switch places""?"
"Theory, theory, theory, but one thing is for certain, hawking was a pedo"
“All science is political”. Brian Cox in a RNZ interview.
"Wibbly wobbly, timey wimey."
This guy is AWESOME
I cant now see Stephen Hawking the same way as before
I wonder if black holes contribute to the expansion of the universe. Turning matter into space itself after consuming matter.
Can’t disprove all the crazy theories of fictional black holes because there is no evidence of them to observe. It’s a religion among “scientists” that has been used to solicit funding for a hundred years.
"Maybe black holes are planets that have created them with hadron colliders ,and that's why no one is left to talk to ."
"The earth is Flat and God created it...
Now that is the greatest truth that Satan has hidden from mankind ❤
This is why the black hole big bang theory does not make sense...its all contradiction"
Cox>Keating
"What a brilliant and engrossing presentation!!!! ❤
Thank you professor Brian Cox 🙏 
Wow!!! The universe is beautifully mysterious......
As those brainy scientists get to know more n more about how this mystery unravels (and i hope the universe doesn't disappear if we actually crack the code and know the ultimate secret).... i wish to hear all about it only from Professor Brian Cox!!!!
❤
👏"
this guy is like the keanu reeves of space
"That was lovely and yet so sad. I never thought I could feel sad for a black hole. But the way he explains it makes sense... death of the star separated them but they are entangled. The other can not enter into the darkness, and must go into the light and because they are forever entangled what happens to the one happens to the other. And this keeps repeating with each particle until they are all rejoined.... until finally the black hole is gone. They're rejoined because of the entanglement like star-crossed lovers...? But where did they go?😢❤"
My earbuds glitched for a minute throughout this so for a while his voice came in half a second late in one ear. 10/10 experience enjoyed hearing about physics from an echoey ethereal voice thanks Brian
"There are 8+ Billion black holes in the Universe and each black hole relates to a person's mind and inner self on the Earth. Black holes are ways to get to know about future events and recall past events. That's why we get dreams. If we can perfectly crack our black holes, we can change past and future events of our lives. 
NOTE:


















































😂😂😂😂😂😂 Lol 😝"
Excellent!
"How do you Know something is real? What is reality? What is everything composed of? If we only look at things we think we see, what is the unseen? If we think we are conscious, what is Consciousness? What is 'animating' the so called 'you'?
If we dream, where do we go in deep sleep? What is a so-called soul or spirit? 
Time is a construct, a limitation, probably the greatest hindrance of Knowing. 
Theory's are not experience. The experience of Knowing One-Self is the greatest Self discovery one can make.
Consciousness is the 'animating' principle. In Consciousness no-thing exists until it is given a perception. The perception becomes a projection, like a thought (but where did the thought come from?) which creates a concept, a belief forming a construct, our so called 'reality'.
But what you really want to know is what inside or rather on the other side of a black hole? Answer: A white hole, which is an emergent 'point' of creation. No time, no space, no limitations, just a place of Infinite Intelligence, and THAT is what 'you' are. now, Pure Consciousness hidden in a jar of clay!

Lots to discover. 'To go beyond is the explorers dream'. The deeper you go, the more THAT you Know!
Kindest Regards."
"A dish could not serve without plate ,similar with God."
Just  know people you are smart than this he she thing
Sorry… Black Holes are pure fantasy. There is no massive gravity in the center of the revolving mass called a galaxy.
"There's a theory that with having black holes there would be white holes. And if black holes are the links to other universes, what if every universe only has one white hole. And that white hole being the big bang. I think that makes sense. If a black hole eventually disappears and all those particles that the black hole absorbs disappears also, the White hole would push all those particles. Like a big bang."
"Brain is great, but steer clear of Michio Kaku, that guy is a faker."
Brian Cox is such an amazing professor !
Black holes are a myth
Cox is just another actor paid by the establishment to talk shite.The Nick Pope of black holes.
"Wow, God is good"
"There is no proof black holes actually exist. It's a theory that ""a hole appeared in space and sucks everything including light, down it."" There are many examples of stars that have died and are now just a dense mass of the leftovers. Nobody has ever seen a blackhole, ever. Just like spooky ghosts, fake."
The way to reconcile general relativity and quantum theory is by understanding the entropy lines that exist between gravitational vortex systems that are just underneath the surface of black holes.
"What a gifted, kind soul. I really appreciated that."
"It’s easy to rip it out of Brian Cox. And maybe he’d have rather been Liam Gallagher, but he’s super smart and excellent at explaining things. 🤩"
U R The Best Thing
One of the best YouTube videos I’ve watched in a while.
"We have absolutely No idea of what's going on in a black hole 😅

When someone goes thru or near a black hole and then comes back, he can sit here and tell me about it"
Space is fake
What a Hoax
It’s been scientifically proven that the best way to deal with a black hole is to take a shower 😂
Man I love black holes or any hole for that matter.
"Brian Cox tells great stories about about things like Black Hole with cartoons showing what he is describing but they are just stories not fact. There is no proof of any of these things, they are simply just stories that people just make up. All these fancy words like Paradox. How these people seem to believe that these stories are really true simply amaze me. 
I guess they need to sound clever to keep their jobs.
The key word is show us PROOF"
"You don't know what your talking about, chief. All you're doing is fundraising."
So is he just exposing the theory of Stephen or this his history
You know how long I've been watching this event horizon Stephen Hawking's my favorite
You truly blew my mine mind 🤕
"The last thing that freaked me out was multiverse by Stephen Hawkins , but he cannot prove it in his lifetime white great astronomers cannot prove their theories in their lifetime, it would only affirm after their successors years later that their theories were true or false, I believe we are on the verge of this theory right what does gentleman is saying I believe to be true"
Yes it has to go somewhere
To the scientific community do you realize what was just sad absolutely talking about out of the box thinking
How does this intelligent man denies god’s existence?
"Best person I’ve heard talk about black holes.  Quantum gravity sounds exciting, just getting some answers to nature’s deepest questions is the most awesomeness thing!"
"Everyone is talking about Black Holes all the time, why is nobody talking about Uranus?"
What if a black hole is just a wormhole to another spot in the universe?
"Brian Cox is awesome.  I have no place or business watching things like this, they go so far over my head.  But somehow Brian makes it fascinating and curious, and keeps me hooked just with his enthusiasm."
"Gravity is not something that pulls on you. Its just space going into a certain direction. Near a black hole its the easiest to explain. Space only goes to 1 direction and that is towards the center. There is no more left, right and up, only down."
Great talk. Is his book this accessible to the non-physicist?
He's a fraud a charlatan he has lied about everything and soon have to pay the price for deceit.
More useless nonsense talk. How profound
"Just imagine if we were already in a singularity and didn’t know it. We’ll never know what’s beyond the borders of the universe. Likewise, the universe is known to be expanding and the process is actually accelerating. Most scientists tend to attribute this to dark energy, yet we have no real idea of what it is. What if the expansion and acceleration of the universe is a byproduct of an externality of which we are yet unaware, similar to how we think of mass constantly being swallowed by the increasing force of a black hole’s gravity? For every action, an equal and opposite reaction?

As for seeing the manifestation of black holes in our own ‘reality,’ what if nature/physics/foundational principles are fundamentally recursive? If considered in this way, any expression of time/history takes on a new dimension and is relative based on any attempted observation along the recursive spectrum.

Probably wrong, but the video is food for thought—living up to your name, Big Think!"
😮😮😮
It must be a great privilege to take a course from or study with Mr. Cox.
"Hawking radiation irks me a bit... And I haven't found an answer, ok one particle drops below the horizon one escapes, how does the one that escapes... Escape? It's so close to the horizon that it would surely end up falling into it too.

How does the one virtual, now real particle escape?!"
"Brian Cox is one of the biggest lying, fraud shills out there. The amount of gullible and stupid people in this comments section alone just proves how detatched from reality most people are. Deluded to say the least. 🤡🤡🤡"
Does he know his hair looks like how Karen wears hers?
"These damn physicists going round in circles all decade. . . we've known that Hawking Radiation is very likely data spewed from the singularity. And that all data is never truly gone.
Even a simple game from a few years ago, Outer Wilds, has been able to demonstrate and predict this, and many more ideas, than what ""scientists"" in the modern day are simply there to reiternate to what seems to be complete newcomers to these old ass theories!"
Black holes are space bubbles. Space displaced.
Why is he sitting on a roll of wallpaper? Daft.
Seeing how intelligent these humans are is depressing. I forgot to wipe my ass yesterday
Warm holes explanation please
I thought They where like pink😂
It’s so amazing how this man can explain such complex ideas so easily. Just spectacular 🤩
I’d buy this man a beer.
"If we want to progress in cosmology, Hawking-Penrose's singularities should be abolished from physics.  This is mathematical philosophy, it is not physics."
The legs on your C-stand are backwards
And I’ve subtly just been told I’m a moron. Time to go back to watching pimple popping videos.
I have so much respect for Brian Cox and his passion. Inspiring.
"Black holes were even awarded a Nobel Prize, but not everyone believed it. Question from Doctor of Sciences A.S. Chirtsov astrophysicist - “Why do we think that what is observed and refers to a black hole is really a black hole?” Let's go back to the roots.
The so-called “Schwarzschild” solution is not due to Karl Schwarzschild at all - 
""On the Gravitational Field of a Mass Point according to Einstein’s Theory"". 
Abstract - ""Translation by S. Antochi and A. Leunger of a fundamental memoir containing the ORIGINAL form of the solution to the Schwarzschild problem. The solution is regular throughout all space-time, except for the origin of spatial coordinates; therefore, this leaves no room for science fiction about black holes.""
The so-called “Schwarzschild” solution is due to David Hilbert, itself a corruption of a solution first derived by Johannes Droste in May 1916 - 
""DAVID HILBERT AND THE ORIGIN OF THE “SCHWARZSCHILD SOLUTION”.  
Schwarzschild’s solution has no black hole, and neither does Droste’s solution - 
’The field of a single centre in EINSTEIN’S theory of gravitation, and the motion of a particle in that field’ By J. Droste."" 
Hilbert’s mistake spawned the black hole - 
""BLACK HOLES: THE LEGACY OF HILBERT’S ERROR LEONARD S. ABRAMS"" 
""THE TOTAL SPACE-TIME OF A POINT CHARGE AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR BLACK HOLES LEONARD S. ABRAMS"" 
""THE TOTAL SPACE-TIME OF A POINT-MASS WHEN Λ 6=0, AND ITS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE LAKE-ROEDER BLACK HOLE LEONARD S. ABRAMS""  
""The  singular points of Einstein’s universe by Marcel Brillouin"". 
Einstein rejected the idea of ​​a black hole - in his opinion it is not physical - ""The ""Schwarzschild singularity"" does not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. This is due to the fact that overwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light"
Does anyone other than hobbiests really care?
"Everyone repeats the same thing about information but noone explains what it is.
You said basically if you had a book and destoyed it, and if you collect every particle you can in principle recreate it.
But if I destroeyd the book and YOU collected every particle HOW can you, in principle, know that it was a book in the first place and not tolet paper ?????? 
I think YOU end up with a heap of random particles without any INFOmation about what it was in the first place.
Leave alone a black hole alone, please!"
"There is nothing at the center.  There is no space there , its left this dimension.  Einstein was right. Hawking was wrong entirely there is no such thing as Hawking radiation.  He was only trying to one-up einstein  and if he wasn't in a wheelchair and handicapped nobody would have ever listen to him. Bryan has yet to form a original idea. Still love him though and read his books. Sci-fi is my favorite 😍"
"I like to think black holes work as a warped washing machine. You put your clothes in- some come out randomly fused together, maybe a pink sleeve on a blue jumpers collar .. basically, a warped Frankenstein- leaving other parts to vanish partly , if not, entire pieces of clothing"
Black holes matter 😬
Fascinating
If one day probably way before my life time humans find a way to go into a blackhole and not die I believe that teleportation around the universe can happen but at the same time I think you might just get stuck inside and that’s gg for who ever try it
"When brian cox talks, you shut up and listen."
You look at the laws of thermodynamics and relate them to quantum physics. Energy travels to the quickest point of entropy and yet when you look at quantum is it related to particle spin. I want to know more on this.
"in my mind, black holes are simply the ""sink drain"" that produces universes on the other end, whether   in the same time or alternative time/string in a somewhat possible big bang on the other end once a threshold has been achieved if we take into account that time should be non existent within/there after the event horizon: meaning that like a balloon being over filled, at some point enough mass being swallowed in the whole explodes into a new reality/universe.

thats my occam's razor.

so the bigger question is( chicken and the egg related): what produced the 1st universe? maybe there lies the flaw in my logic."
👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
"“Science” is so completely young.

Please think"
"Dear Brian

How do your understandings fix with reality, do you consider  any thing spiritually?"
Something we don't know for sure if they exist could be the key. Great to know. This guy is a charlatan like Michio Kaku.
My brain hurts
A black whole is like mirror and at some point of time one exploded and what happens to a mirror when dropped ? Well you guessed it right bunch of shatter glass same with the black whole bunch of mini stars(galaxies) were created
"9:22 so in theory, we can collect ashes from a cremation a reconstruct the loved one again"
His ability to explain things I dare say is up there with our highly esteemed Carl Sagan.  Am I wrong?
"What causes a big bang???   2 super massive black holes that ate up the universe and collided and caused the big bang and other big bangs, there could be other big bangs happening so far away we would never know about it..."
"I would look at how star clusters open up and stars migrate out. Star clusters should lose stars sure, but they should tighten up after and they don’t. How is it that the Big Dipper initially a cluster has stars moving away from each other? A new mathematics has to be invented which simulates complex gravity fields."
"there are no mysteries to the universe these people always try and make things complicated when there clearly not , there was no big bang there is no dark matter the universe is a giant simulation thats it we are all nodes sharing information with the giant universe computer after death we become total energy being that are fed back into the system we never die which is a good thing to know isnt it , but only some remember the past thats just a glitch in the matrix. all computer code has flaws and bugs were just helping the computer to iron out the bugs when complete a new universe will start without the errors."
"😅guess what, I’m a diehard science lover. I just know more than the science wanna be freaks here and totally despise them. I’m the meaning of the devils advocate. Bullshit is a perfectly fine scientific conclusion. 🤣"
"I doubt it. They are just very heavy objects. An analogue watch on a moving train appears to move forward in time, because it has mechanical gears. The objects inside the moving train get lighter in weight, as the train moves. This means the gravity force on the gears decreases so the gears move faster. There is no time. Time is just our ruler. It's man made.  Whereas if you do the same test on a digital watch, nothing happens because digital devices use electricity (or light) which is constant or too fast to be affected by trains moving. That's about as amazing as a black hole."
My favourite scientist!
Molto bello!
Fake and gay
When 2 black holes merge do they ever stop being a black hole for a split second due to being stretched? Are they even stretched. I know when a star collapses that is spinning really fast. Spin could stop it from collapsing into a black hole due to bulging at the equator. Matter can’t pack tight enough to collapse all the way down so stays a neutron star. If it stopped spinning so fast it would be a black hole is what I heard
"Yeah  ! !
Brian Cox is back"
"Oh please. Very articulate but the same ole bullshit science gospel. I don’t know who is worse, bible-thumpers or the theory humpers."
"The escape velocity explanation opened my eyes on black holes. So many more questions now, fascinating. The singularity, what is that made of? What atoms or parts of atoms are crushed together or is there maybe just one particle in its makeup that could go so dense that all other particles are expelled out as energy?"
I think I speak for everyone when I say this was interesting af.

"Brian, so if it turns out that there is other intelligent life out there, did Jesus die for them too?"
"He is not beyond simplifying his language and complex concepts so the non-scientist can understand, yet he stays on topic and explains the subject in a way that is still super interesting."
That was fantastic

He really doesn't know shit is what you learn from any interview with him
"Black holes don't exist.  You have been conned.  The supposed ""image"" of a black hole at 11:45 is also fake.  The image only looks like that because of the limited coverage of the array, and a data sampling bias.  Also, Einstein was wrong, and a plagiarist."
Get dumber faster with that clown
I agree are black holes creating big bangs for a multi verse
"You lie, also you're wrong... very wrong"
We don't need to know what spaces and time are it's just existence but we search for answers!
Why would a black hole suck everything around it and destroy it when it has entered it!
Brian what's the best drug you have taken?
"To save your time, he basically said we are all gonna die and universe will end to nothing. You are welcome"
"He could explain how to make paste and I would listen, he is an amazing speaker/teacher......."
Please send me.
"every object in the space had a front and back. and behind the back is still  the space. so, what is behind the back of a black hole? or, while it is in the space, it does not have a back?"
"Just finished Cox's books on black holes, a MUST read for any black holes enthusiastics!"

Does that mean we can bring people back from the dead ? Sure sounds like it.
this guy is a legend
From the thumbnail I thought it was Keanu Reeves explaining about Blackholes
Did he say he has a new book out? God I hope so because he'll be doing the rounds promoting it and I haven't seen him for a while. Even just  10 mins with Brian Cox is such a joy and fascinating without compare. He's just fabulous at explaining it and bringing it to life for everyone. Thank you for the vid
this guy truely amazing love it
How can people not like physics
"As a child, I only dreamt of going into a black hole."
"Good stufffancy questions, just Slainte ❤"
"I love that no matter how mind boggling the universe is, scientists treat it like any other puzzle and are grinding it out. Instead of being blown away, they keep digging and using math/science to figure it out like any detective not affected by the tragedy of a brutal crime but figuring out how it happened getting the full explanation of events, motive etc."
Could over time all the black holes in our universe have collided and then expanded creating everything we see?

"Brian has a gift of assembling the right words together when he talks about physics. He helps you think the way a physicist does in simple terms. Not many scientists have this talent because their minds think so quickly, they can't put the words together that make any sense to us. I think the ah-ha moment when one begins to understand what Brian is talking about is what so many young want-to-be scientists are looking for. He provides that one, thought-provoking spark that you find yourself thinking all day about. He will inspire many of our youth to be scientists and they will continue to unlock the secrets of the universe for all of us."
"Thanks but no thanks. Save it for later.
In a town a called malice..."
I feel like death allows us to ask these crazy questions. Everyone reading this comment.... will die one day. but before that we have an insane desire to know why this is all happening. I envy the future because they will have the answers that we could never yet reach
Lies
John Wick is that you?
Is it possible inside black hole all particles become one.
I can’t draw for the life of me
if you collect all info then you can recreate like going back in time. All particles use them to recreate another universe and thats how its described in ancient books as well in India and other ancient books. Universe gets destroyed and recreated again and again..
"this man is very smart and I love listening to him, but I'm sad that I don't understand most of what he explains to us, not because he doesn't explain it well, but because it's too complicated to understand.."
God theory up next?💀
"Cox is an utter charlatan who doesn't have the faintest idea what he's talking about. Einstein explained why black holes are inadmissible solutions of the field equations back in 1939, and why they cannot form in a universe of finite age. Cox probably thinks an electrically charged singularity can electrically influence things outside the event horizon, violating the most basic tenets of special relativity. The academic community has become a disgrace to humanity and to life on Earth."
"From the illustrations given, everything is a black hole/black ball. The electron, atom. molecules, stars, planets, moons, galaxy or merging galaxies...once formed there is a force on their areas of control (include gravity, magnetic fields...), there is evolution (some are life, cells, plants, animals...) in the surface and activities in the inside (ion, quarks, boson, nuclear fission/fusion, magma, molten core...). Energy cannot be created nor destroyed, it simply transformed into another kind. So, these appearances of Black Holes/Black Balls are only stationary. Now you can see and observe after it is gone. It is correct that everything is living on a temporary space and temporary time!!!!! Unlike LHC (acceleration and sudden impact) while Blackhole/Blackball is by friction."
He should try ASMR 🎧🤤🌌
This is the inevitable future of our Galaxy. One day our Star/Sun will die and become a Black Hole!! We have just a glimpse of the reality of Time!
Black holes are solid mass
He’s an actor who talks bollocks
Brian coxs words are like magic
Always wanted to meet Brian cox and just enjoy his warm personality and galaxy brain.
I have seen plenty off Black Holes in my life time....... But never seen them  unlock the mysteries of our universe..... but not complaining  had a good time 😀
Clickbait...
"I have often thought that BHs are points where a new universe was created. On one side, a BH is seen (or not seen as it were), on the other a big bang!"
For me the most brilliant moment of that lecture is when he said (paraphrasing) in order for us ro ask questions about when the Universe started we must first understand space-time itself.  Only then can we begin to ask that question. Wow! Kind of a light bulb moment for me as silly as that sounds.
as we cant seem to get beyond the moon i cant see the point of this.
Can a black hole be hotter than a star?
What is the smallest possible black 🕳 hole?
"There will always be something deeper until you accept that God is in control. 

Read your Bibles 🙏🏾.

Nonetheless, impressive and interesting work."
"Wonderful. Does the radiation have no mass? Why doesn't the black hole get small enough that light can escapes as it ""dies""? Reverting back to just a star."
So why dont nasa build a model rocket essentially and fly it into the black hole that would be something I would like to see and maybe some of the questions would be answered as to what it actually could be
"I cant die not knowing more to space, time and the speed of light"
Brilliant and humble! It was such a pleasure to listen!
He looks like Keanu on a high calorie diet.
"Tell Brian that it's not an ""idear"""
I know hes a man of science but if he had to guess what is reality I would like to know the answer
Back holes are just reality in reality. An infinite paradox of levels of blackholes. I firmly believe this. We think our universe expands and may one day collapse like blackholes. Is interesting for sure
He explains in such a soothing and clear fashion
"7:59 Wait doesn't this animation play in the PS5 menu screen or during startup?
Like when you press A I think it is these particles that disperse"
They say my aunt Leslie was only happy when she was pregnant but I saw her happy alot more times than that
What now?
Apparently independent of each other never existed in history...🤭
Love Crian Box.
What does he know? The same as us. Absolutely nothing. All theory without any backup evidence. I'd rather listen to a fly explaining the theory of Jam.
The bhig bhangh
Loved this video but I was doing dishes when I played it and the amount of ads I had to take off my gloves to skip was ridiculous.
See people we are giving a space our time values but rather to acknowledge more to human that in space universe is a that probability where we know that their is no stop value but knowing in earth where time stop for momentum than see because earth has a thermal process going with time when temperature is low so most of part in earh are like freeze its nature of living but when high temperature value comes its again has changes going like melt or freeze or freeze or melt but in space no freeze no melt no stop to move or put any mass of bodie in one criteria but space where everything mass of bodie is moving freely because they have a surface to move in that surfaces of values without any stop so see we can't give a value with time in space on earth time has value to stop either see any creature they have a value to live in life cycle in time of values that how much that life can be live in that projected of time but in space their is no time to project that bodie mass in which time it will stop to move or in which time it's time like as creatures on earth that it will die so see we are giving our time values that time values which comes in life once a period to stop but in space no period in any life of mass bodie which can stop its nature we see star has probability to die how can star die no it can't see star which to known as star loose his charge values so then star moves to another surface and another surface gives another values to star particles to bond its nature to that surface because if star loose it charges so that surface has no value to bond its nature then in space other surface or any surface they have different state of nature to collide a substances in space see in earth times has probability to stop for momentum but in space no momentum is to find that rotation is going to stop so see time has different values in space rather its only work with space when we gives a any mass bodie a pressure of force to move in direction which direction is like to calculate a time or distance with speed only than time works for bodie to move in that velocity of time of speed of that mass of bodie either space their is no such value that time stop for a moment in space but in earth time to time changes going and time to time values coming and time to time life begin or end but in space no end only we see how life is going and if we something new in space so we set that thing with time and then we give time value see space has its nature what you see or what not it depend on space nature and then your time values of mechanism which having a work procedure with time either see we don't know how life begin in space but we know in earth how life is begin or going for end so time matter mostly in earth either giving time values to space if we know how space begin so on that time we give a value of time in space knowing begin or end if space has no end so how time is working time only works in beginning or end but space has no end or no beginning so time we giving to space is not a proper value of time only time which is proper is knowing that what we send to space a bodie of any mechanism so that mechanism has time value to evolve it with space but when time values comes in end to that mechanism so time only matter for that mechanism or speed or mass rather time has no value in space because in space no end no beginning ok
Keanu reeves in short hair. Literally.
utter BS with no proof just fairy tales told by people before him and he believe them without any proof
Smaller black holes should be called brown eyes.
"gravity being dictated my mass I would think black,holes would play a role"
I could listen beyond the borders of time listening to people like mr. Cox with their explanations and theories of space.
"what a crap of all those socalled techno fysc people  who talk and write about time; they totally NOT know anything about the base fysics that TIME never has existed and is a misconcept of primates like Sapiëns 😂😂🤣😂🤣🤪... ;
every 5-10 years i ask and write socalled great experts to rewrite the time variable into a cycle  ; having base variables like temperature ( eventhough also Kelvin is a misconcept because going lower than -273Celcius is needed to understand anti-matter) and frequence and energy in terms of pre-Hertz respectivaly Joules to understand as first but essential needed baby-step ....:
what ya get is an immediat understanding of eg neutron / plasma / blackhole   stars.
Furthermore ya need to understand and see my string-""show"" by which ya understand both the gravitation concept as well as that everything is connected ; it is a very simple understandable experiment with a rope ( !,) for even a small child (!) and the child will be amayzed how rather simple it looks to understand ALL kind of strings (!!) ...
And as last one the most extremedangerous experiment to show how to create a bigbang aswell as the main start of a primitive first black hole, done with a ball of metal....

al those 3 things are always ignored by all techno fys people till now, eg also Hawkin 🤣🤣🤣😂🤫🤫... They can't deal with the 3 simple orders/commands and some even went nuts/angry/irritated... "" it can't be thàt simple"" is the stupid most often heared read reaction.... Sapiëns has a transfer-brain-problem... even when it is the simple sentence that "" time never exicsted but cycles do  while/because cylces are variable in frequence and energy and form/wideness anyway/allways ""  🤣🤣😂🤣😈😈😈😈


search/find me and contact me easely... BUT don't lett ya be fooled by all the stupid stuff i show via eg my own sites/videos/photos/text till recent/now....;because i have to hide my true activities and identities because of the low capacities of primates like Sapiëns and me as a Sapiëns-anatomy aswell have/has to deal with an/my own low-quality body/anatomy..."
"God gave us nearly infinite playground to entertain our imagination, so the experiment can happen. But we' re in a laboratory (simulation) and we're unable to understand what's outside. We're able to understand how laboratory works because God left us clues which we can find. The main question is why we are here, despite the fact that consuming your mind in understanding how everything operates is a pure joy. We can spend thousands of years in searching for the answer to ""how"", but we can try to find the answer to ""why"" every day."
Has there ever been a probe sent into a black hole?
*The Big Bang was a Supernova.*
"So a black hole is basically a quantum encyclopedia at a sub electron level. A sort of a possible electron transporter., in a constant state of flux. Until it has ejected all of the bits of information that it has consumed over a vast period of time. In theory. Say some sort of a mechanism with the power of a black hole. Could possibly put those pieces of information back together or at least display that information at the atomic level."
Whats locking the stuff in place? A garvitational hook/cog?
keanu reeves
Your mind is full of quantum confusion. What is the equal opposite of a black hole? Figure it out and. you'll become closer to the truth.
"Hey guys, maybe I have an naïve thought, but could the singularity once full of its mass be the other side of a big bang?"
"I've always found Black Holes fascinating, but I've never connected them with that line, ""End of Time.""  It's very poetic."
"I’ve read a lot about black holes even been to one of your shows Brian, but this with the computer animation is the best. Love it carry on doing what you do best"
I like the style of your presentation! ❤
"Einstein,Newton & Prof Euler make current scientists Weinstein , Witten & Cox look like journeymen they are basically regurgitating the same content. If a black hole is a dead star how do you expect it to be alive  or have a mystery in it?  My concept is that a blackhole is a non-biologic living entity  non -biologic because it can't have DNA because DNA denatures at high temperature it's    autonomous & feeds on other stars , unknown if has an excrement organ viz theorized to be a warmhole  . It has certain specificity because not all stars become black holes others become planets others sun & moons etc. Aliens might not be existing in our normal humanoid biologic term due to the extreme heat of the universe & shortcomings   of the DNA inability to handle heat."
"That was the best explanation I've heard of black holes. When I watch or read anything about black holes, the information just bounces off my head, back into space! But some of that info actually got in!"
I think black hole exist but not exist at any moment
"This mans gonna discover the existence of god bro, hes unstoppable"
"We are in a black hole, outside of a black hole you are looking at the end time, inside the black hole you are in time, our universe is expanding at the speed of light, we cant escape the the universe unless we go faster than light, Light can leave a black holes gravity, our universe is the opposite of a black hole, expanding at the speed of light inside, outside everything close enough is being pulled in and particles too, and our universe is expanding like the si gularity of a black hole is the end of time so in our universe that singularity would have to be the beginning and where all that stuff that got sucked in starts from ,we are in a black hole ,"
I thought Hawking radiation has basically been debunked?
How can the singularity bring you to the end of time if a black hole has a finite life?
I’m fascinated but not clever enough to take in what he’s saying 🤔
"There is another universes big bang on the other side of it, black hole this side, light burst that side."
"Pffff.. we still haven't learned nothing new since the 70's.
This worries me"
"This guy's condescending smirk, (I know know everything and you don,t, )just gets up my nose."
That was something so deep and beautiful ending ❤😊totally mesmerize the soul
"I don't know what is about this guy, but once he starts talking, I become hypnotized and cannot stop watching... true."
I can listen this man speak for years.
"You all know FA, all the money you suck out of society for the BS you talk is a crime."
Liar
i think that aybe black holes are gateways through space and time and possible other realities/universes.
"The thing is, we're not meant to understand Black Holes. Anyways, they're not holes, they're stars. In trying to explain them humanity has truly reached the limit of its understanding."
"But since UFOs can create their own gravity, doesnt this make all these theories useless?"
isnt it just a star that sucked it self off? whoops

Brian Cox has to be the nicest atheist ever. He doesn't believe in a creator / God but refuses to call religious people stupid.
about information inflation in black holes
about information inflation in black holes
"If the black hole works with the logic of a mechanical hard disk or ssd on which data is constantly overwritten, and let's say when the black hole is formed, let's say it first swallowed a star, planet, neutron star, asteroid, etc., and finally swallowed a star named b. Since it swallowed other celestial bodies between the first and the last, does it still have the information of the first a it swallowed? Because they say do not write data on the disk to be recovered in data recovery, do you think what I wrote makes sense?"
What happens when a spaceship in a warp bubble encounters a black hole? Please answer
"From Argentina, thanks Big Think, thanks Brian!"
"""COULD"" in other words we have no idea!!!"
SO BASICALLY WHAT HAPPENS IN A BLACK HOLE IS THE BIG BANG
I clicked thinking it was an Oprah biography.
"Let's start by balancing the budget first, lol.."
"is the big bang just the final black hole, releasing it all... ? galacic DNA?"
"% TIME IS UP !! John 3:16 For God loved the world, so He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Realise you are a SINNER !

"I have a question to ask 
👉 Does time change ? Is there anything such as change in time ?
I personally have my own individual view of time"
They are just radio waves n numbers!!    These clowns just justify their degrees acting like they can explain it!!!     What ever they think it is it is!!
"Wouldn't the black hole consuming one half of the entangled pair increase it's mass? Like, I don't see how it's radiation of the black hole itself, it seems more just a consequence of quantum theory at the boundary of a black hole. It kind of implies to me that a black hole should be eternal. Even when all other matter in the universe has been consumed, it's still able to feed forever."
"Talking physics using imperial system?
Lost my respect."
"When he said we don't even know what time is, that was refreshing to hear. A scale we invented and use to enable us to determine relative positions in journeys?"
"""it seem that space and time are not fundamental"" 🤯"
"If a black hole slowly loses mass, wouldn’t that mean at some point it would become visibile again as the escape velocity < c at some point?"
"Can someone pls explain, if the center point is infinitely dense, than how come different blackholes have different masses? Wouldn’t any volume have infinite mass so all blackholes would approach infinity? How can there be different singularities 🤔"
"point on the remark made at 11.30 in the video, Brian Cox made a series of programs one of which described the beginning of the universe as a point whereby there was a region of infinite energy that had been there for an indefinite amount of time (time used loosely here), and for some unknown reason an event happened and all the energy was released and formed the universe, although the series was made some time ago now and obviously theories and ideas have changed since then..."
Brian Cox using imperial units
Merit based think mind in there man.
We r basically living inside black hole
❤❤❤😮😮😮
if you want to understand the relationship between general relativity and quantum mechanics you have to ask how is each moment in the universe created. What process does it go through?
Protect this man at all cost.
Surely the best vedio 💕
"The analogy of the book being compared to a black hole has one major flaw.  The book didn't make itself.  Sure, you could collect all the burnt particles of the book, but you would have to know ""HOW"" to put it all back together or what to build out of the particles you captured.  You could reconstruct many different things out the burned elements of the book, not just a book.... You would have to have the awareness to build the exact same book with the exact same letters on the pages etc. That ""how"" came from an outside source (human intellect/ ""consciousness"").  Information can be lost in the universe. If a human being is born and dies his/ her consciousness is destroyed."
"All speculation... Brian Cox is just like you and me sold under sin ready to die....
Romans 6
For [31†]the wages of sin is death, but [32†]the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord"
I SO wish we could go into black holes and find out.
"They are intriguing cause human can't get there, yet. After human become space even time traveling specie, the universe may not be that interesting."
Nice bookshelves
People say nothing exceeds the speed of light but obviously gravity does
Has anyone else tried to listen to Brian while going to sleep and during sleep ? It takes you to some beautiful places....
I just love his demeanor and aura so much he’s so Yassified 😍😍
There is not center of a black hole. The event horizon is where matter and light are squeezed into 2 dimensions.
The background music is very distracting
"Could 2 partial behemoth black holes ≈30-50% the mass of the universe each, create such a gravitational pull relative to each other that they’d collide at the speed of light and the reverb of that collision is what we call the Big Bang?"
It hints to the holographic principle and an accompanying sort of multiverse theory wherein each black hole is a sufficiently partitioned area of spacetime that we can consider them as separate universes.
"I know I didn't just get G noted in the first 12 seconds of this video... 0:09 WHEN I WAS, A YOUNG BOY"
I am convinced that black holes hold the key to understanding unified Quantum theory of gravity. This is it.
i like
Zero of new and useful information.
Bro gave the greatest explanation I’ve ever heard damn ..
"Brain cox has no idea about black holes, for one they do not exist.
Tell them Brian why the false label Black Hole hasn`t been removed and the label given to them just over 200 years ago is not still applicant .
Brian Cox is an ANTI EDUCATOR."
"There are 7 astrophysicists😂, physicists and quantum physicists that are my favorites. 1. Richard Feynman, 2. Albert Einstein, 3. Enrico Fermi, 4. Michio Kaku, 5. Brian Cox, 6. Hakeem Oluseyi and 7. Carl Sagan. Two however were/are  a rare breed that can explain complex theories and laws of physics that ordinary people can understand. These two are Richard Feynman and Brian Cox.  I am extremely appreciative of their talent and expertise of explanation in everyday terms."
"Please shut up Brian. I'm really tired of your pop science. Physics is in crisis. Too many physicists have caved in to ultra speculative ideas. Some even saying whatever their paymasters want .... and it's clear they don't want boring science. They want sensational science and speculation, but these days it verges on science fiction. Most out of control and most pliable ... Michio Kaku .... who is regarded as out of control by his peers. I doubt if peers is a correct term because it implies he's at their level. It's all a modern Internet thing where views mean more than truth and almost anything goes. Rigour has gone ....."
"Black holes are the creators of every single multiverse, planet and local solar systems. There wasn't a god that created anything."
"Neither you or anyone else can or will do anything with a black hole, and to even think so is utter  complacency. You will  not do anything now or in the future, all attempts will end in failure. To even think you are at the beginning of understanding a black hole is fool hardy and stupid."
Brian cox the wonderful thinker that can’t even prove most of the hat comes out of his mouth 🤔
"He explained everything so simply.. then he said ""The simple way to say it..""
This guy is amazing."
but is information energy?  Ultimate knowledge is power....
His voice explaining tough subjects is stil comforting
"This dude just be Benjamin Buttoning casually, i swear he looks older in 5 year old videos"
Just imagine the Black absorb just like the eye it collects  information it is fast er than the Speed of LIGHT.
"See the thing is.....Brian understands everything he is saying at a fundamental level, which then allows him to explain it to people who are not well versed in Physics"
your sitting on a white hole
GOAT
I recommend everyone due some research on this mans background. He is such a badass in a happy and friendly mans body
Are we not already in a black hole but we don't know it?
Love this man
More Brian Cox!
what is essential is invisible to the eye
Best.
"I still don't see how Black Holes can conserve information. You can have all the burnt/destroyed material that made up a book, put those individual pieces (each atom etc) doesn't remember which other atom was next to it when the book was intact. There's no blueprint within the material itself to re-construct the book, whatever ultra powerful computer you have. I don't get it."
"My maybe not belief but at least very deeply engrained feeling is that the 'end' of a black hole is equivalent to or even literally 'the big bang'.
It just lines up too well for me that the universe springs out of the explosion this supposedly infinitely dense point which seems to then ultimately swallow itself up back into this infinitely dense point.

I imagine this as sort of a continuous pulse or sine-wave like process that's infinitely exploding outwards before contracting to the point where it essentially inverts itself and expands back out.
Or doesn't so much expand back out as much as it contracts to the point to which it inverts itself and in a way doesn't really expand back out as much as it continues to contract - but in the opposite direction :P

Expansion and contraction becomes indistinguishable.. Just at one point one becomes the other, even though the process or the forces applied haven't actually really changed direction or anything like that.

I imagine this is as a motion that has always been ongoing and always will.
There is nothing that could or would have at some point set all this into motion.. And nothing that would or could even stop it from continuing."
you have to plug in the blackhole to electricity and it turns into portal
Didn't know Keanu Reaves became a theoretical physicist after retiring as the chosen one.
black holes are the most interesting thing in the history of existence
there are no black holes nor is there a universe. don't you trust your own eyes anymore?
"What are the chances the emergent space time being the cause for expansion of the universe?

Considerimg the theory of cosmic inflation, the actual universe is 150 sextillion times larger than the observable universe. Based on all the dedected and undetected black holes of all sized from small to supermassive, how sound is this possibility?"
God is certainly glorious and wonderful! He has blessed us with the precious gifts of life and time to explore and discover all of His wonders! Fascinating stuff!
I think understanding consciousness is a big piece in understanding the universe
"1 Corinthians 15:1-4

Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also ye have received, and wherein ye stand;
2 By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless ye have believed in vain.
3 For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;
4 And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:"
"The same Cox that encouraged the jaab that did nothing and is laden with side effects? Same guy? Cox… you are more of a cok than anything, true story, prove me wrong."
"In 1935 in comments to The New York Times, Tesla was critical of Einstein's theory of relativity: ""... like a beggar clothed in purple, whom ignorant people take for a king.""

You flat earthers followed Einstein down a rabbit hole to nowhere. Good luck getting back because you have just been outed by the JWST as the epitome of collective stupidity."
His books are bloody amazing. 'Why does E=MC² began my love affair with physics
"Supreme intelligence and excellent communication skills = Brian cox, pleasure listening to him as always"
Imagine earth is getting sucked into a black hole and your butt naked in the shower
Gravity
"What if humans are just not physically capable of understanding the backhole or the 5th dimension? Like our brain is just not complex enough to comprehend the information. Just like how a turtle won't understand astrophysics, no matter how you explain to it. There has to be some sort of physical limitations on how we perceive information. Kind of like explaining algebra to a mosquito. Imagine aliens looking at the black hole and instantly understand it like we look at fire."
interesting
"Absolutely fantastic video. You've earned a sub, like, and much more of my time watching.  Well done.....very well done."
Fake ass Keanu Reeves
They've proved black holes can't exist because of electric bounding. This guy is an intellectual fraud.
An eloquent elucidation of a complex cosmological subject. Poetic.
at 10:10 .. thats not imaginable
Gods creation is a summamabitch. 🙃
incredible ❤
how could scientists like Einstein know about black holes with having very little technology...how did he know they were there?
Someone explain how one particle escaping and one not would cause the black hole to lose energy. It seems like that's adding a particle to the black hole while the other escapes.
Someone explain how one particle escaping and one not changes would cause the black hole to lose energy. It seems like that's adding a particle to the black hole while the other escapes.
"no physicist but i wonder with our ability in quantum entanglement, if we could somehow see one part particle entangled with another, but we view it our particle as the other crosses the event horizon."
Why dont we solve earths humanity problems first.
Is the entangled particle that escapes able to do so because it is an antiparticle and therefore the force of gravity is essentially reversed for it thereby shoving it out?
"If time slows down to close to zero at the Event Horizon, then given the age of the universe (13.787 ± 0.020 billion years), not enough time has elapsed HERE in our space for ANY matter going into a black hole to have moved appreciably inward to the center.  Thus ALL Black Holes (of age 13.787 billion years or less)  MUST BE hollow 'SHELLS' of CONDENSED MATTER and none have had time for any matter to reach the singularity condition....at our current universe's age !  Right ?
ALL black holes would be HOLLOW spherical Shells of Highly Compressed matter of unknown thickness just under the Event Horizon.  No singularities - no contradiction of Physical Laws.  Just condensed matter there 
Maybe given gozillions of years of elapsed time in THIS universe, the older Black Holes WILL eventually form Singularities and THEN perhaps form NEW universes with their own Big Bang in another ""space"" !  i.e. if Singularities cannot exist, they possibly 'break out' into ""Other"" universes....
If you read this Dr. COX, please comment.  I have a PhD from UC Davis (1973) in Biochemistry.[Retired]   WHY no replies ?"
Thanks Brian.
Can we still call them black holes? Or do we need to call them african american holes?
That $h!t just blew my mind-balls!
Doesn't the conservation of information mean that you could theoretically reconstruct somebody the exact way they once were at one point in time? Doesn't this imply immortality is possible?
He is superb. I love listening to him even if I don't understand it.
"If the Big Bang was caused by a quantum fluctuation of 'Nothing' that produced 'Something', could some quantum fluctuation produce another Big Bang right next to you or me? "
Can you explain the ocean now
That's not how the universe works read a book
"And ... Yes, Brian has a way of giving a good speech that makes or helps you understand concepts like black holes. But, I didn't take physics in college so for me, whenever I pick up a book on physics I actually have to re-read the page or other a few times to just partially get it. 😅 Yeah, and years ago at a book store I saw one titled: Schrodinger's Cat. A particle or a wave. In the box they could be both until it's observed. Entanglement theory. 😂 That's amazing!"
A PhD in particle physics? How young is he? Yup. Okay. I want to know at what age he got his PhD. 🤓
"Dr. B. Cox ... easy to listen to, makes complex ideas/theories somewhat understandable to the masses, all around great educator."
Do you actually believe what you're uttering?
"The Material World can tell us nothing, as it is an Illusory sense of being. Therefore, there are no answers in this illusion that will offer anything but illusion!!

You must correct the Delusion of belief in DUALITY in order to truly understand the True and Only Nature of Being!!

INFINITE, INCORPOREAL OMNIPRESENCE!!!"
To be honest I dont know anything about what he says but he's calming nature when he talks makes me understand. I would listen to him the whole day.
I love this guy!
"I love Brian as much as the next guy however, am I out of line saying I would like him to say things that aren't so recycled? More than happy to be proved wrong of course!"
These ease with which Brian explains subjects and his clear passion make science more accessible to all of us.
"I like this guy, but he's selling a book on OTHER people's ground breaking theories.
I do like this guy, but....."
What a loser
an excellent storyteller! That was such a great story and the way you told it was mesmerizing!
"Interesting can we calculate a black holes or I infinitely defense poi
nt in space time ro an actual point until space time"
There is no matter at the atomic level just waves of energy
galaxies are simply the accretion disks of super black holes.
4:49 it can? or always?
"diese politiker sind bald alle im knast oder schlimmeres, sie wissen was ihnen passieren wird, Stillstand, nie wieder etwas lernen, ich werde politiker im stillstand halten...und sehr weit weg von Macht über andere....im grunde werden sie auch nicht viel Macht über sich haben, stillstand und so....und in der hölle die ich ihnen erbaue, wird jeden tag  jemand vorbei kommen der ihnen bessere lebensbedingungen verspricht..... ich glaube das werde ich tun...es muss jemand sein, der dabei nicht lacht...also äußerlich......... die die wissen was sie tun, werden wissen was ihnen passieren wird"
"I am not even close to be able to consider doing the math. I don't know if this is the correct way to think about a black hole but i think of it as a photograph. A photgraph that is fading. The photograph represents the collapse of time and space. A reversal of their membranes.
     I wonder what happens when they finally give up all their particles."
"The answer is …
Our universe already is  living inside a black hole ! 
Any limit science knows can be similarly apply to a black hole .
Event horizon -> our big bang .
Our space expand faster then the speed of light -> light can escape a black hole .
Etc.

The early universe is simply the inside of a star and it explode creating a black hole , and here we are ."
Space and time are just information lol
He forgot to introduce himself as the keyboard player for D.Ream
"if time ends on the border of a black hole, could our perception of time (13.8 billion years ago) have started at the end of a unimaginable big black hole and the cosmic microwave radiation we see is the aftershock of that explosion. we are excelerating away from that singularity"
cryan box is lost
Brian Cox talks about the universe like its his wife
How can you say singularity is end of the time if the black hole itself have an age? Singularity itself has a time as it decays because of hawking radiation.
Maybe black holes are spawn points
"If the proposition that every blackhole is the genesis of another universe it would provide a argument for the conservation of energy and a progressive maturity of time and space.
As a blackhole evaporates then that universe would progress into its own blackholes and itself would degrade into timeless photons with no space or dimension 
This is messing with my head"
"We literally have no clue what a Black Hole really is or what it does or if it even is a Black Hole...And never in the earth's life will anyone ever go to one and really see it. Quantum is for those that really have something to hold on and make up all these theories that cannot ever be proven...The future scientists will remember the years after Einstein, as the era of the lunatics."
"Having watched so many black hole videos over the last 10 years, (Cox, PBS Spacetime etc) this could have been such a basic summary of the subject etc. But no. Straight into depth with where we are at right now, entanglement, hawkin radiation, emergency space time. I don’t understand each subject to proficient detail but I’ve watched enough to atleast see how that sentence was strung together. All those theories having a place in this deeper theory. My mind is absolutely fucking blown"
I think black holes are a floor in space and time
In Quran ALLAH says that All thing will be resurrected including human. From this video it seems 100% true
They don't even know how the universe started he's an hypocrite says one thing then says something completely different a few years later
"In my basic opinion with no college+ education, it almost seems as it black holes are actually the reasons we have the big bang and stars in such. A location in space with many paradoxes, lack of time and understanding. Just to eventually die, releasing the information it essentially compressed over time. Results in a sort of bang, thrusting out particles and energy which over time mold into stars and planets etc.

Basically, i always thought they were almost like a garbage disposal of space, but after watching this, its almost like a recycling plant.

Damn i love science"
Are we a mechanism in a quantum program?
black holes are as credible as god and jesus
Amazing!
Neil Tyson is overrated.
"Do you consider a black-hole is an atom ?  What happens if we capable to accelerate black-hole(s) and smash (instead of making binary black-hole) each other ?
How many particle(s) emitted ? How many Feynmann diagram generated (sub-black-hole particles transform to photon/other particles) ?"
"I enjoyed this so much, I can't wait to share it."
You kind of fairy queen arent you boy its ok u like to make up stories as u go along dont ya
"Space and Time, Black Holes and Singularities
Ok you’ll need to humour me and follow carefully on this one - it’s a bit convoluted - but I ‘think’ it might be right
So just to set the scene…….
‘space’ and ‘time’ are at right angles ….. and everything moves at the speed of light -  light moves through space at the speed of light and matter moves through time at the speed of light - when you move through space you deflect your speed through time……..
That may be completely counter intuitive but, trust me, it is true!!!
So now……….. I’ve started thinking about ‘space’ and ‘time’ inside blackholes…….. 
It is already widely accepted that, inside black holes ’space’ and ‘time’ swap places!!! 
But what does that actually mean…….?
‘space’ becomes ‘time’ and ‘time’ becomes ‘space’ 
And ‘infinite time’ becomes ‘infinite space’………. Think about that!!!
Compression and storage of ‘stuff’ -  ‘matter’ and ‘energy’ and even ‘spacetime’ itself is no longer an issue if ‘timespace’ is infinite!!!
But then, what are the implications for ‘matter’ sucked down beyond the event horizon?
Is the nature of that ‘matter’ also reversed - If ‘space’ becomes ‘time’ then does ‘matter’ become ‘energy’?
Storage of infinite amounts of energy in infinite ‘timespace’ should not be a problem!!!
And then …… consider this ………
With ‘matter’ (mass) removed from the scenario the ‘space’ and ‘time’ dimensions cease to exist!!!
And without ‘space’ and ‘time’ even ‘gravity’ does not exist!!!
Remember - Energy - Mass - Time - Space - Gravity - in that order!!! - ‘mass’ underpins the rest!!! (space and time are not fundamental)
Take away ‘mass’ and only ‘dimensionless-massless-energy’ remains!!! - potentially infinite ‘massless-energy’ occupying ‘zero space’ and ‘zero time’ - no spacetime, no universe, just ‘massless-energy’ and maximum entropy - this is the ‘singularity’ - a ‘dimensionless nothingness’ - both a singularity and infinite at the same time - something that actually exists outside of the remit of our ‘laws of physics’……?
 - which is actually the same as saying something that exists outside of our reality………. (IMHO :))"
"So, Black Holes are actually Portals that open and close to infinite multiverse for a finite period of time."
"You must study the Quran if you want to understand the reality of this universe ,our creator and Purpose of life."
"I've not heard from Brian Cox for a good few years now, he is a remarkable teacher, and certainly hasn't lost his passion or his ability to teach in a way that most people can understand."
"I love this dude. He's one of our finest. Quick question though. Was he hinting at black holes basically pollinating space? I know the death of a star and carbon breed life in space, but does more even come after the collapse?"
"It’s something that’s really caught my interest, but my question is; is a Black hole a sphere or just a round flat shape?  Because it can only vacuum in one way right?"
And there are still people who are absolutely convinced that the earth is flat and gravity isn’t a force 🤡
Excuse my language but this just blew my fucking mind
"Brian I used to like you , not anymore you bloody liar"
"There are people like prof Cox - thinkers, who look for answers like, who we are, where do we come from, where we are heading, and then there are corrupt politicians who wants to destroy everyone who is not in for the steal.  That’s why we probably destroy ourselves sooner than we find out these things"
"I'll unlock it for you, black holes separate the soul from materialism."
"When your trying to define anything in reality, you need to look at the extremes.

When it comes to the most extreme gravitational force in the universe, that exists in black holes.

When you look at the smallest “thing” in the universe that has no mass, doesn’t experience time (from its perspective), doesn’t decay in a vacuum, has a neutral charge and is known as the most stable particle in the universe, that’s a photon.

Photons are more fundamental than gravitational force because there are no conditions which will change the fundamental properties of photons."
U guy's think all this but don't think who creates all this why ur so stupid and wasting your time why not just read quran and come close to the one who create all this just open ur eyes thanks
This guys and Neil deGrasse feels to me like entangled particles. He speaks a lot but means a little and here is this guys means a lot and speaks so little.
Latest telescope pictures proves that we actually know 's**t' about our Universe... so people just 'make up' stuff...
Wait if this is so an he understand this the way he dose he should be able to create time travel
Ypu can almost smell the excrement coming out of his mouth 😂
"I dont think to this day that information is conserved in black holes. Energy is conserved, but information isnt conserved inside the black hole. I dont think we will ever have definitive proove."
black hole sounds rracist ı htink we need to think a better name for it
"How my brain has always understood black holes are like the mycelium of the cosmos, it devours it's nearby vicinity almost like dead leaf litter and recycles said matter into a slow release back into the universe. Really dumb rudimentary view but it's the only way I can view it without it bending my head in two"
"So does escape velocity only apply to an unpowered object like a cannonball? Clearly it must, so a rocket could climb slowly away given enough fuel, perhaps if it were nuclear powered for example. That being the case, escape velocity wouldn't apply to a spaceship crossing the event horizon of a black hole - if it had enough fuel it would be able to escape having seen inside."
Tak. Men stop den musak. Din stemme er vigtigere ❤️
His smile is as beautiful than his knowledge and happiness
Rodger Penrose said the universe will slowly fade away and then start again. I believe we are in a black hole. . Each universe is a black hole. A universe begins from a singularity in a black hole and then fades away until the black hole collapses and it’s starts again. Sorted.
"It’s maddening to be interested in these subjects, but too dumb to grasp even the most fundamental concepts."
What you are looking at is the universes DNA. All living and breathing things have DNA.
bros just saying words
"In any case someone curious wants to know if (because we do not really know yet) there is a serious alternative explanation to what we consider being blackholes. And such thing as an alt model with proper maths and visualization that makes interstellar travel possible by, hang on, inverting masses. Here is Janus model, its ambitious and quite coherent, might need some attention from proper independent scientists ;-)"
"He keeps talking as if matter that interacts with , “light” is the majority of the universe"
"If I understand correctly his explaination...every ""things"", atoms, molecules and so on are somewhat bonded together by ""information"". This invisible link, named entenglement, is what bonds the shared information between those things together. And so far, we have no idea what this invisible link is, but if we manage to understand, we could have understood the fundamental nature of the universe."
brian COCKS
Great editing.
"I don't agree with Hawking Radiation. I know it's a theory and because someone highly intelligent came up with the idea, people use it almost as proven. It is not. The idea that the random occurrence of a paired particle even over eternity would evaporate something that is taking more in than it is losing by this random occurrence doesn't make any sense. Not to mention, most if not all galaxies descriptions of blackholes, it makes sense that the galaxies would combine eventually with gravitational attraction over time. This would mean that most likely the black holes would not evaporate and that it is nore probable that we live inside a large black hole and from the outside to something else our universe looks like a large blackhole. 

The event horizen makes it that time exists outside and inside but not at the edge so there is a separate timeline inside and outside.

It is quite simple actually"
As soon as it talked about miles without even translating into Kilometers i ended the video.
Mine is a reality and a creator
Pseudoscience verging on religion.
Im sure he agrees there are only two genders
What happens to the phantom dot. When all matter is pushed into what is essentially a single atom. The matom or smatom super massive atom. What happens to the elctron shield. Does it extend into a solar system size mass of energy. How would that react to regular matter. There are no holes obviously. A phantom star must still be there. Does it split up the dimensions of the time space continuum.
"Go to compton,u’ll see it"
Cox likes to explore black holes 😌
"While we're discussing the complexities of the universe, it would be great if Youtube could refrain from constant commercial interruptions right out of the blue. I know they need to make a profit, but it's getting beyond a joke and ruins the content."
U can check it . Surah al waqiha verse 75 and 76.
I hope we all get to see all the misteries of physics and the Universed solved. I honestly wanna end my days in a toroid while watching with a beer my grandson break our upperhead neighbour's window after an amazing baseball homerun.
Even galaxies set down too
"In quran it is explained eg. it says blackhole is like dip,  where stars sets down. They dont end but they set down thr forever."
Something deeply hidden ❤
In an alternative universe a black hole is on a podcast talking about how to disguise itself to make sure humans don't understand the reality of the universe time and gravity.
"There’s no possible way the universe is only 14 billion years old. The universe could potentially be 14 billion years old, but it could also potentially be infinitely older than that.  When in doubt, always go with the answer that makes you feel less comfortable and more insignificant."
"I don't understand why it can't be just nothing at the center. It's called a 'black hole"" for a reason. What if there's just a hole there, filled with nothing, or space, and the matter of the star constantly approaches that space?"
I’m very familiar with black holes-my partner has one!
"This is great thought experiment material, and someday might become proven.  But, what is the likelihood of ever being able to collect all this information?  Zero!!  If the lifespan of a blackhole is a trillion years, the information would be spread out to the far edges of the universe, and would become commingled with information from other black holes.  Who is going to collect the information specific to a single blackhole!?"
You are capturing the imaginations of many people in a very intimidating topic.  Thank you.
"You act like ""black holes"" exist...😆"
Someone should have told him he had a bat in the cave.
"Not an emergence, but an appearance unappearing."
One thing you never see in a video of Brian Cox is a negative comment.
"idk if im right or wrong for this, but i have a huge crush on this man OMG."
It's nice to see Joachim Löw take a drastic career shift. Love what he did for the German football team
"I don't know why understanding about black hole amuse me, especially when time slowed down / stopped when reached singularity."
"Brian Cox explained the mysteries of black holes so elegantly and precisely, that even I am impressed!"
All black holes join eachother over time until they absorb everything in the universe and explode into a big bang giving birth to a new universe
"I have developed a thermoacoustic engine that will make air, hot water, electricity and gravity.  It uses sound to make heat and sound to move the heat in a feedback doughnut shape. It is technically a mini galaxy in a box. Because it makes it's own fuel from water condensation it gains mass and therefore should slow time. I did not patent it and I am too afraid to build it as It produces high voltage and high amperage. I am 40 years old now and would like to pass on this knowledge to someone who can do something with it. I have engineered every part in 3d ready for a cnc machine... there are 13 non moving parts. It requires no magnet... no coil... no battery or power source or any moving parts... and is so incredibly simple. It should be able to do light speed because it is a galaxy in a box..... I have the option to patent it but I think it would likely be seized. If you are interested I can give you access to the drawings to make the parts. I will never build it even though I did all the engineering myself. It uses 2  x 12 inch granite disks as thermal conductors to move heat to the center of a doughnut to make sound move in a feedback loop and produces hydrogen that is thermally heated into plasma that is spun in a doughnut... that is contained with the magnetic field it produces from the heat and vibration. Very simple when you see it.. but complicated to explain. An engine that can gain mass should be able to slow time.. and I have figured it out. This device has 2 holes... the air hole to let air in and the black hole where everything gets sucked into it... because all the cold air goes down and all the hot air goes up and so all the cold air at the bottom of the device will get sucked through the hole and make a sound that keeps it running forever."
I think we should start by burning a whole paper and reconstruct the contents of it
(Triangle) imagine talking science on a platform without the symbol for change. So funny
I read that thumbnail differently then what it said.
"I’m not as smart as the rest of y’all, but I just see that it’s pretty simple which really is when you push the handle down the toilet drains everything as you’re saying the concept of what a black hole is is that but now you’re saying that it’s not myself is I just learn to understand how a black hole should work Now, so now I don’t know exactly how to should"
"C I know you get a lot of things to thinking normal guy from the hill and I you don’t believe this but I’ve seen stars die in my life time and you are very correct about a lot of and I just want everyone understand that you’re correct a lot but it’s not absolute there’s things that you don’t really understand yet but you’re learning and I’m still learning myself after all these years I don’t have your education I have life experience and I do add anything to this is that I want more science to figure out what I’m doing and I go in the right direction your black hole theory is correct to appoint but like they all say it’s all circumstantial there’s no absolute proof it’s just that we live so far from any of the black hole. It would take us thousands millions of years to get there unless we have understood and have a blow black coworker which affects a wormhole which can be directions, if we use gravity in the right way, gravitation of everything is what Newton says it’s the beginning and the end of everything and put a simple us beginning in the end you start or you stop"
"his theory Hawkins there was a white line next to the blackness behind the white, there’s a barrier between all the black hole, and the present, the white ribbon and any other planet would do for me would be for 50 protect, our actually given cohesion with everything"
"But all horizons has a point definition where it ends up at you’re saying there’s no end to the definition point that means there’s no end no end to the black home so what we see by the Hubble or any other scope the rotation event horizon is actually a fabrication of what we see but it’s actually not what it really is the concept of it. Is that the toilet or drain we honorable, I mean to let the common people understand that’s what that is, I know better but it’s still there’s no actual proof that I know of myself is someone sent they object or toilet paper down the drain per se I’m just talking to scientist that well I don’t have all the connections but maybe they said toilet paper down the drain per se I don’t know about they did. That’s cool as fuck."
What actuality of the event horizon is cloudy what is actually we don’t know is that a place that we can actually substantially stand out birthday in a ship and never have to go past that point or is it something that we’re automatically going to be sucked into or pushed out?
"Being Brian and what you say in your way, they are the key we have to stand together as a people of the planet understand each other and just work to go to the next which is the moon works go next to whatever play Orman call stairstepping and keep doing that will probably take hundreds of years maybe 1000 unless you got a better plan"
"Sooo.....Falling from the event horizon to the singularity might take an hour in your local time, but from the outside, your light cone redshifts slowly until you fade as you get stretched to a wavelength as long as the lifetime of the black hole. This dissipation of energy is (from the outside), bled out slowly as Hawking radiation over the entire lifetime of the black hole...
....I think I get it...."
"its interesting to me ,but my brain can not comprehend a blackhole i need a eli5"
Black holes are nonsense. The “image” they produced is CGI.
"We can't even prove black holes exist, yet a lot of people talk about them in a matter of fact way. We claim to have a photo of one, but it's a blurry mess that we can't guarantee beyond any shadow of a doubt is an actual black hole. We claim to have the math that says they do exist, well the math also says out there must be a planet with flying buttholes that fart rainbows, but we can't prove it beyond any shadow of a doubt. 

Now don't get me wrong, i'm no space denier, but we have to look at the facts as they stand. The fact is we still don't know everything about our own planet, we know even less about the planets in our solar system, let alone much about our solar system. We know even less about our galaxy, and next to nothing about our universe in the grand scheme of things. Yet we sit here and speak in a matter of fact way about something we have NO clue about, something we can't even prove exists."
Brian Cox (with his effeminate grin) is a disinformation artist and an insult to all the genuine professors in the past and present.
what is the point of the 4 1/2 foot roll of seamless paper?  it looks weird
I do meditation just by listening to his voice!
"So this is a simulation, that much is clear, then the blackholes are the recycle bin of the OS, that is why all information is preserved... 🤯"
"Dear religous people,
Please watch this and then think while being silent. 10 minutes…. 
Welcome to the first day of the rest of your beautiful lives.
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"""It seems that space and time are not fundamental"" might be my favorite thing I've heard a physicist say. Tickles my imagination bits"
"Brian, you should include in your creds speech at the beginning. Hi, I'm Brain, I have been, yah dee yah dee yah and a scholar far too long. LOL Love ya."
"We have this ide how things work around us, our math theories everything and you stumble upon something thats so hard to comprehend but it's the answer we have the anwser now we just need to under stand the question. I hope is 42."
Is there a chance there is another dimension that explains all of this?
Accretion disk important
The black hole theory would then be related to Kant’s theory about “ Ding an sich” ?
I literally still have no idea what is being explained my tiny pathetic brain just will not keep up. I am truly in awe of how intelligent Brian is but you do give my arse a headache as I try to understand.
If thomas shelby went to college
"If you cant mix black hole, general relativity and quantum mechanics, wouldnt that mean that one of those theories are wrong?"
"How exactly does this help us in anyway? That's right, even if we unlock it we can't do anything with the information."
"An open question to the comment section: what is ... being? Example: ""what space and time really are"". Can something truly be anything other than what it is described as, what its properties are?"
🥱
"In my opinion,

I really thing these black holes are nothing but stars with no light.
Makes sense right?

Now how does it makes sense it makes sense because if stars had not light they would be black ofcourse, because dark is the absence of light, therefore just because they have abnormal types of rings that stars don't have in my theory black holes have those rings of fire like light black holes are another types of stars with alot more mass and with rings, and in my opinion those rings are another stars being stretched out and its there particals thay are the rings.

Now look we cannot go into a black hole because it has alot of mass and it stretches things out and even if we managed to go in one, we would experience dark like full dark.

Now main thing is ever saw a blackhole collision?
See in black hole collisions the black holes are stretches out each other and this is why they create a abnormal sound, and other theories are just cartoonish. Like how in the world can black hole be a portal, like yeah there is a chance but my theory makes sense because i'm trying to say is black holes are made for controlling our universe and they eat stars so our universe doesn't become over populated with stars or planets, the main thing is why black holes suck everythingis because they don't suck,they actually have a strong gravitational pole, and thats the reason.

Maybe this should have changed your mind but, there is always a but, the main thing is that black holes are made to control the growth of our universe and the reason they are black and have rings is cuz they are stars with no light and with strong gravity, and therefore we can never get into a black hole😊 and we are basically orbiting a black hole too, like we are orbiting a sun and all the stars are orbiting a black hole.

Maybe black holes are boss level stars.🤔

And btw its my theory not others and my opinion other theories tor black holes don't make sense😑🤔"
Such fascinating stuff!
I’m dumb but does this mean that we are potentially a simulation made by advanced life forms that reconstructed the hawking radiation information that is our universe and we’re actually a past civilization that isn’t alive anymore?
Him and mark cerny must be cousins 😂
"If a planet was flat like a pan cake, with the same mass as earth an the same properties, same rotation around the sun. like  a flattened football Would it still have gravity? Silly question I know, but I wonder if the shape has a Direct correlation to gravity?"
I love cox
Why dont we get AI to figure it out?  Oh yeh i forgot AI still doesnt know how to tie a shoelace
He reminds me of a young Carl Sagan
Is that the same guy who created Chat GPT? He is building AI and talks about B Holes.
"I could listen to Brian Cox all day, what a storyteller he is and he’s describing complicated and complex subjects so well."
Cox hasn't defined time.
Figured it out not saying though that noble prize is mine!
"""hints of something deeply hidden"" = simulation"
"He has the same eyes as Keanu reeves, and Alex honnold."
COX is GENIUS
Nice ❤
Humans will never know the answer
What a legend. He makes being extra clever extra cool. 🤘
Why doesn’t he disappear in one
"I have a question, if we consider that photons do not have mass, on the other hand the black hole's gravity tends to infinity, that is, its mass is infinite, according to the equation for calculating the force of gravity, that is, F= G.m.M/r², We have zero multiply by infinity, which needs to be resolved in mathematics and is not acceptable for numerical calculation, so how can we say that gravity effects on light from the side of the black hole and does not allow it to escape ?"
"You know what they say. Once you go black, you don’t go back."
Conservation of information appears to support the idea that everything is predetermined.
Why are you sitting on a strip of white carpet ??
Why can't a black hole just simply be a dark matter dark energy power plant and why is it crazy to think that gravity isn't in itself dark energy
The most brilliant man....but never forget his crimes against humanity as the keyboard player of d-ream🤣🤣🤣just shows nobodys perfect❤
he is freaking brilliant.
in principal and reality are two very differentg  hitngs. That book is gone
I wish we discovered something completely new all around us what we could not see before. :)
thanks 😍
"I could listen for weeks to Brian Cox, and never be bored"
All the gaps between protons and electrons colapse onto the nucleus
lol. a master class in narcissistic word salad crapola
And y’all believe in the Big Bang 😂
Great explanation..Mr.Brian❤❤
Maybe more of a focus on practical math rather than quantum physics which can’t even be tested for verification of truth of a claim.
Brian Cox is gods gift to us . grateful i live at the same time as him
Thank you Cox! Complex things with simple explanations! )
"I am positive Brian Cox has the key to understanding how time works because at 55, he looks 30."
"we use the force of wind, air, heat to produce electricity, which seems to be the source of our power. if we managed to use gravity as one of these forces... wouldn't it be an infinite source of energy?"
"Yes, but when will we have warp drives?"
I don't think he is ever getting old.
If only black holes existed then.
I thought the bonus hole was fundamental.
Is it possible a black hole could take away the annoying music?
"Just saw the  universe S1 E5. It's about how our universe began and the idea of big bang being not the start of the universe. Anyway... at some point of the documentary my eyes teard a bit couse of the awesome way that he explains the whole event. Thanks Brian. If I were a woman I would say I love you, 😋 but in fact I realy like your storytelling.  I liked  the cosmos series told by Neil de Grass Tyson but he became full of himself and is not as good a storyteller as he was. So just as I reveere David Atenbrough for his comments I regard you a level above becouse I'm a space junkie. But only if it's commented by someone who puts his soul into his work and words. Thank you for making me love space, astronomy etc even more. Just had to put this out. Love from Slovenia."
Don’t listen to this con artist
Hahahaha BF
Can someone tell me: what was in the space where the big bang happened? Is the universe in that space or did the universe create it's own space?
"This is really well shot and edited. The music, the grading, the pacing, the closeups, the wides, the graphics. Cox seems very relaxed here and it's very well constructed as an edit. Thank you!"
But if light has no mass why does gravity have any effect on light. Should be able to escape black holes or simply just go around them no matter what !!!
"We now think, and it does seem indeed... I wish I could get paid to say nothing."
brian cox always reminds me of if noel and liam gallagher had a smart brother
is it possible that black holes heels universe ?
Yes aschhole
"if for our brain would be possible to understand what is the universe someone would figure it out by now, so we will never understand, its someone`s creation  i can. just guarantee that"
Anybody else get annoyed at the amount of times he says “fundamental” in every video?
There are cox in brians own black hole.
Cox is deeply concerned with the inner workings of black holes. Arent we all.
What is the source of the event horizon clip at 0:43? Please?
"In 1974 I was in Northern Ireland, I thought I'd fallen into a black hole."
Black holes starring Brian Cox😂
Brian is an amazing science communicator ❤ BUT what I wonder all the time: is this his real hair?
I THOUGHT THIS WAS KEANU REEDS FOR A MINUTE
I'm ok with Brian & certainly glad I cannot understand most of this and do not care about any of this AND I do know that NOTHING here will ever be proven or seen  by any living person and the embryo of any embryo on earth today ..
"re 7:54 He (& those he cites) seems to ignore that the rate of time for virtual particles (or any other mass) to 'do' anything near the event horizon, is computably 'zero'!"
I always knew that space and time did not make sense. A lot of advanced physics seeems like it’s made up to try and fit the theory to explain what’s being observed
Stop getting black holes wrong. It’s all calculations and theory. Has this fella ever falling into one? No. I have. I was transported into a parallel universe. Cox was a three headed rabbit. He told me to go back through the black hole and tell of my stories of hanging out with him and a whippet called Kenneth made of cheese. So here I am. Ask away.
Is this scientific idea suggesting that the idea of life after death (sans the religious overtones) just became more plausible?
My ex  girl friend says l you can’t get back the burned ps4 ok
Brian Cox is just brilliant.. you just can’t look away whenever he’s explaining something.
"I love     that   Freddie Murcery song .....    "" Another one bits the dust  !   ""      ....   Its  such a swing !!    ;)"
"Gravity is made up , it doesn't exist. Black holes as well ,so as galaxies and big bang, globe and stars and planets. This blok talks bull $hit. Facts : we live on STATIONARY PLANE NOT PLANEt."
I probably would have been a physicist too if I didn’t get into drugs at a young age but I have YouTube.
Stop this racisim.
"Secrets of the universe, fuck yea!"
black hole is the place we go when we R dead.
Fraud.
will computers ever get good enough that we can just simulate a black hole and then go inside it in spectator mode?
"We need to train AI on quantum physics. Just like Chess, it's going to eventually surpass us all by a few orders of magnitude, and then we'll suddenly be able to understand a lot more of the universe."
"Hello from Kazakhstan. The optics through which we look at the Universe are too polluted by hundreds of theories like Einstein's general theory of relativity. Therefore, an experiment on cleaning optics is needed. For this I suggest:

 Postulate 1. Light is an ordered vibration of gravitational quanta. Postulate 2. The speed of light, regardless of the source, within the “framework of the dominant gravitational field”   This is determined experimentally using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope (based on Michelson's experiment 1881-2015). Using a hybrid fiber optic gyroscope, the straight-line speed of vehicles can be measured."
"The ""singularity"" or ""ringularity"" cannot exist, because infinity doesn't exist in nature.  The ""singularity"" means our theories need updating, i.e. a quantum theory of gravity"
So glad his brain can dumb it down. I'm still hurting and it's in my saved
I dont understand anything.
Brian is quickly overtaking Neil as my favorite YouTube scientist.
"If we can't measure the age of a black hole, we don't know how old our universe is."
"Was there 'space' between the atoms that made up the entire universe, just prior to, the Big Bang? Is there space between the atoms at the heart of a Black Hole - if so, how long has that 'space' existed? 

Is it too, now expanding? Is it 'Space' at all, or is it being confused with 'something' else..."
I've watched this video like 20 times
A national treasure
"Dear Brian, PLEASE READ THIS COMMENT; I may know what Dark Energy is and Dark Matter? Is it possibly Hawking Radiation? This is positive energy that leaks into our universe that shouldn’t be there. It’s meant to annihilate itself in a brief instant and conserve the balance, but that’s not what happens. Could it be that it has a positive push and forces the universe to expand? So far I’ve had two cups of tea with 4 mini thin crumpets for breakfast. Oh and I’m still in the bath, but I’m sure I’ve found the answer. Actually it was quite simple to solve, ps I got a C in maths, which means I have no idea about equations just the broad sense of how the universe works, well, maybe. I might be right! Or wrong…things might be clearer after lunch. Xx"
"Listen!! Either it's a hole or it's a planet. Stop calling it both. 
It's absolutely ridiculous."
"To be completely honest, I am so fascinated with the universe. Anything to do with it weather it comes to black holes, stars, multiverse theories or other habitable planets, is just so intriguing to me. However it takes me a while to understand certain explanations of subjects which is a bit of a bummer really it makes me feel like I’m just not smart enough to understand it yet I want to be. It’s hard to explain but iykyk."
Great production!
I love how Cox fills me with more knowledge
On shrooms fuck.
"This man makes me weep tears of joy and makes me feel grateful to be a part of something terrifyingly unknown.  We know so little.  And this weird thing that we call the universe, has no beginning or end.  It breaks my mind of fear and sets me free to live my life."
"referring to the end of the vide... I think to catch ""the glimpse of something deeply hidden"" from a scientific standpoint, you'd have to become a scientist first because if you don't know what you're looking for, then if you even find something then that information would essentially be rendered worthless assuming it was already revealed to someone who doesn't know what it is they found if they even became conscious of it in the first place."
What's the windows shortcut to clear my hawkin radiation?
"When the cosmic vagina reveals its deepest well hidden secrets, we'll be one tiny step closer to fully understanding the fysical laws, known as God."
"How can a Black hole be able to fire jets of rays(lights) as usually shown in pictures or videos, if nothing can escape its gravity?This doubts my mind whether black hole really exists or it is just a mere imagination of scientists."
Are there white holes ?
Goosebumps.
"Brian, physicists need to clearly define what they mean by ""information."" Additionally, physicists have not proven that ""time"" exists independently of sentience that uses time to measure stuff, like speed. Why do physicists believe that mass is the key thing that holds things together?"
whose better Brian Cox vs Neil deGrasse Tyson?
All things prefer to go down the drain. Even a black hole is also going down the drain.
Can one ever get to the center of the BH?
How anybody can smile when the gravity of the weirdness screams in one's face is way beyond Me.
This was not just great but beautiful learnt a little more excited to learn more and understand more 👌
Several reversed universes?
"I thought that only on Italian YouTube channels there were ignorant people ready to say their opinion without any knowledge. But I realize that here too it is full of people who want to show new theories with their opinion.
Please, instead of blathering, bring new studies.
Thanks to BigThink and the prof. Cox, nice explanation!"
it can be that space is one big black hole witch in time exploded and lets all out and in time again will squeez us back again. endless loop in extreme period of time.
The best explanation i have ever heard
One understands dimensions(diameter magnitudes).. as one truly understands the source of them.... My profile pic...the hyperdimensional holovesica. It is the most primordial interference pattern... the crux of sacred geometry! It Is...How... holoverses... are born! Kinda a big deal!😂🎉☯️
"Hyperdimensional Holoversal ""black"" holes... work this way: A) You are an eternally infinite source singularity of pure awareness which fills the center of a circle. B) This ""circumference"" happening around you... this sentience experience... is your event horizon. You're a Big Bang... Baby!🎉😂"
"Really now? He speaks about black holes as if they are a fact. Tell me please, what evidence is there that black holes actually exist?"
I used to think he was clever but he is typical English guy with a gift of gab
Horizon of time theory. Dusk and dawn horizon
"''If you are lucky and persistent, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden''... God?"
"The one thing I can never put together is whether the center of a black hole, or is it a singularity? Those two seem contradictory to me, so I must not be understanding it correctly (I do have an engineering degree).  Division by zero, which is the definition of a math singularity means everything is gone and exited the universe. But I also hear about micro black holes and how there actually is a core of matter in a black hole.  How is there being matter congruent with a singularity?

That question has always bothered me because of my training. If there is a core of matter, that means there is no actual continuous flow of time space when looking at the large scale. Perhaps nothing ever makes it past the accretion disk at all... matter there comes to a relativistic standstill because it is accelerated to near light speed.  On the other hand, if it's a singularity, then it might act to create a truer flow of timespace through the ""bottom"" of a black hole into somewhere else."
Brian Cox is my fav
Oh wow a YouTube clip where he allows comments….lol. What a joke
thanks Keanu Reeves
"All that information would not com back in order, it would take a super random event to produce life as we know it"
"It is impossible for the weakest force in the universe to over power all the other forces. Gravity accumulates as magnetism multiplies. Soo ridiculous. A gravity based star is as preposterous as a thermonuclear star that doesnt know what critical mass is. Lunacy, to be mild. And a neutron star,  gravity overwhelms the atom, gravity creates fusion, wow thats dumb."
I often wondered what happened to Wild Bill from the Green Mile.
"Wouldn't it be interesting if the formation of a black hole actually creates a big bang, and thus a new universe, in a dimension where time and space are flipped, existing perpendicular to its original universe? That might explain where all the matter that enters the singularity actually goes, and why it does not seem to exist in space anymore, at least from our perspective."
I could listen to Brian all day. He's so knowledgeable and explains things in such a way that you just can't help but be so interested in what he's saying
Conservation of information. Maybe that is why our universe is so smart. It was born smart to form life so quickly.
Does white whole exit
Brian is great....just not a fan of the Karen haircut he's got going.
"I have a question, and Professor Cox is one of the few persons that might know the answer to this question. If we are made of carbon and other elements that were created in supernovae, and when we look through powerful telescopes at very distant stars, or galaxies, looking so far back in time, is it possible that we are seeing some stars that we are actually made of? That would be really cool:)"
What if we are already on the other side of the black hole? 🤔. Maybe were looking through the peephole on what has always been the wrong side 😳
Nice fairytale again.  Where is the science?
Oh there's an L in the title!  I missed that. Was searching for something else but stayed for the knowledge.
The answer is....there is no time.....its something else !
I love Brian Cox! 👏👏👏
Jesus might of walked on water. But Steve Hawkins can run on batteries.
"Do we have actual, experimental prove of the information conservation principle? How it works together with entropy? This principle is sustain even though we have the second law of thermodynamics?"
I’m too dumb for this
My god! Brian Cox has actually aged!!! 😮
As much as Brian Cox talks its again all speculation. Nothing has been proven true. In truth many things have been proven not to be true. The Big Bang. The origins of the moon.
The end of a black hole creates dark matter..
Thanks!
reading the comments under this video hurts my brain
I am black. My asshole also black. Is that consider black hole?
hermoso
What if we are the singularity..what if we are at the centre of a black hole 😎😱
Why is he sitting like that?
Brain cox one of my faves
Man that cox going deep into black holes here
"How certain are we that the Hawking radiation actually exists? Do we really know if nature allows the spontanious creation of entangled pairs of particels where one particel is inside the event horizon and the other one is outside. When we say that we do not understand what the inner workings of a black hole are, how can we then be sure that the black hole actually allows the creation of such radiation?"
"The universe is round. 
It is wrapped around an ultramassive fireball.
Black holes are pin holes in the fabric of the universe and are sucking in as many protons as possible into this massive fireball and will eventually suck in our milky way. 
The bigger this fireball gets, the more the universe expands"
"I see Brian Cox discussing black holes, I click."
I’ve never understood or had it explained the concept of how time is effected by a black hole. I understand how it can warp space but not time. I’m sure it does and all these smart people know better than me lol. I just don’t get it
Bullshit!
Black holes are literally the result of mathemeticians dividing by zero. Its hilarious.
Listening to Brian talk is as captivating as Carl Sagan was.. Both brilliant orators & able to put across information & knowledge in a way non physicists can understand..
I wonder what Brian will say after a few well known physicists stated that the big bang theory was debunked by James Webb telescope. As Brian strongly claimed that you can clearly see signs of the big bang everywhere...Brian?
Something I like about his guy. No homo.
"thank you Brian, very good explanation for me.  is it possible that there exist a timeless universe which we can not measure because we live in a time frame. if there are particles  which in absolute sense do not move they have no time. we cannot se nor measure them because we can not stop our time. 
exiting to think about don't you think?
Thank you, I am henk baas"
"Mediated to center of everything is Nothing. 
 Nothing travels faster than the speed of Light. Correct! Nothing is instantaneous. 
 Nothing doesn't have pressure."
"Black holes are FAKE!! You scientists have used it as the explain all for everything you don't really know. Can't see it. Can't prove it. That's exactly all that it is. An ""IDEA."""
They don't freeze time. We just can't see inside because light cant escape. We base time on our visualization of movement. Time isn't really a thing. It's a way to measure light passing you.
"This is very misleading. Time does not really exist. It cant be ""stopped"".

What he's meaning is light, aka our visual representation of how we see time will stop. You would seem to freeze, but nothing outside the black hole really stops. It's a visual trick thats local to the black hole. 

Like slight of hand magic tricks."
"Entrance to hell , the light thread is the only way out"
The singularity makes sense because time does not exist in the singularity and  in the singularity time ends which is a direct reciprocal of the big bang where all matter was a dense point like the singularity where time began....idk if anyone is getting this sorry I'm high af lol ☠️
He is a great educator. Got me interested in this subject. I wish I could turn back time and work in this field
some more material on white holes would be much appreciated !
That’s not Keanu reeves
"I've been searching for this information 3 years ago, I'm so glad that this clip has finally made it on to YouTube as I thought I was going crazy..."
"Could it be that in a black hole information is partially lost to some odd dimensional obscurity.  We have Hawking Radiation, but could we be experiencing one side of a blanket, which for now we’re in the black hole phase and the other side of the blanket is in the white hole phase."
What is reality and why? We are all part of the light.
this guy is the british version Keanu Reeves
The 'Black Hole' is a reflection of the relative universe.  We exist in a Fractal.
That part about space and time being an emergent property from something deeper and hidden made me cry.   I am so moved by this video.  It is so beautiful.  Thank you.  The mysteries of life unite us all.
If light cannot escape then why is it constant at 186k/s ?
Question. Hawking radiation is from 2 particles coming into existence. Quantumly. I get that. But they didn’t originate in the black hole. Why would the loss of one of those particle pairs shrink a black hole or have info about it. The matter in there or that fell in is still inside ?
The black hole as u call it.. What if there not a hole in space.. But a gravity well..??
you need to get on jre again brian... i want a 3 hours conversion about the universe
"Beautifully built video piece. Speaker, theme, music"

"Fictions are necessary for the people, and the Truth becomes deadly to those who are not strong enough to contemplate it in all its brilliance. In fact, what can there be in common between the vile multitude and sublime wisdom? The Truth must be kept secret, and the masses need a teaching proportioned to their imperfect reason."
Time is not real
Time is not real
What if you and I  experience gravity because we are in a black hole?
He made us and He will do it again!
its true something is hidden but what ...we will never know
Is our milky way rotating a black hole sir?
Absolutely brilliant video. Brian Cox is so wise I could be hearing him from hours and hours. Thank you very much and greetings from Spain
is this about anal sex with natives?  if it is... i'm all for it.  black holes are a top topic  today on the internet.
Galaxies moving away from each other. Hmm isn't that what magnets do when their poles (n-n or s-s) face each other and move to each other when different poles (n-s) are facing each other? All these large bodies produce massive  magnetic fields and magnets can attract or repel each other.🎉🎉🎉Dark matter my 😮
Please use metric system in your units. This supposed to be a science video
What an amazing mind this guy has!
Blindness of the eyes?

:P"
So it sounds to me like the 'big bang' could possibly have been the end of a black hole?
"""space and time are not fundamental"""
"Maybe in the not-too-distant future, we will soon say ""beam me up Scotty."""
"Beautifully explained. It does leave me with one question. If anti-particles can spawn on the inside of the event horizon, with their counterpart on the outside drifting off, thereby extracting energy from the black hole. Why wouldnt the opposite happen? (anti-particles spawning on the outside drifting off, with their counterpart on the inside) Thereby extracting energy from the universe and giving it to the black hole. One would assume symmetry in this case before asymmetry."
I think he is like Carl Sagan of modern time
That quote is truly beautiful.
Brian Cox speaking without interruptions is a sermon... salute from Egypt.
"Also,  could what we call ""the Big Bang"" in fact be BOTTOM of a Black Hole that keeps generating new ""stuff"" that may explain the JW observations?"
Could Hawking's Radiation be DARK MATTER from collapsed Black Holes?
Let’s send some duck tape on a stick into the black hole
"9:16 I dont know why but to me, that looks like a pair of ass when you're layed down on your chest... doesnt it? I always thought Black Holes were ass holes anyway, since it's black inside, you can't see shit lol and everything that goes in you goes out that way... isnt that funny haha."
"Time is an illusion of the mind so if Time stops inside Black Hole, that means death, right? Space/Time is only a tool for the mind to know where and when it is. At the end, everything is in our head. Believe it or not, it doesnt matter anyway."
"Thank you Dr. Cox.  Excellent presentations beyond any doubt.  I think we simply don’t know, and human beings never will, what the “universe really is.”  Space if infinite, I think, but no one really knows for sure.❤️"
"Brian Cox could walk me into a black hole, willingly, while reassuring me that everything will, indeed, make sense eventually. This man just now explained the universe in a way that completely reaffirms my belief that we do go on, somehow."
"Man, I wish i could understand this ;-)"
I like Brian Cox I loved his documentary series I call him the punk rock Physicist
"Imagine him explaining this in Maths class.sure i would not understand anything.but this 
This is nice for all common people who never studied this but are genuinly interested"
Does light exist in a black hole? We keep saying it cant escape may be light has no meaning beyond the event horizon .
"What if you go so fast into the black hole as you past the event that matter is converted to time, even light is converted into time."
Black holes are a myth
I thought this would be a segment on Michelle Obama.
I like Big Thing great channel
Keanu Reeves
BHM
"If black holes do have a finite lifespan based on the loss of HR, are we currently able to calculate how long they could exist for?  Also, would it remain a black hole when it no longer possesses the mass to maintain the gravity required or would it just “cease to exist” as suggested in the video? Professor Cox is always so interesting, thanks for posting!"
"I've got an important point about light and black holes seen on our own sun, called sunspots.  The sun produces black spots on the sun.  Does that mean our sun's gravity increases locally around those sunspots so the light can no longer escape?  No.  The energy radiating from those locations increase while the wavelength of light shortens to the point where optical telescopes can't see it.  Hence why the solar wind increases drastically radiating from sunspots.  The light is still there because radio telescopes are able to see the high energy photons radiating from sunspots, magnetic fields.  

The same thing then must also be true for black holes.  They produce the high energy photons so optical telescopes like Hubble can't see it.  But point a radio or infrared telescope at the massive star and it will stick out like a sore thumb in high energy short wavelength light. That's exactly what radio telescope see.  They detect massive amounts of high energy photons, but no visible light.  Their entire surface has become one massive sunspot, radiating a high energy invisible solar wind.  The entire black hole would be black to optical telescopes, just like the sunspots on a star.  

The entire idea that the gravity of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape can't be proven.  But sunspots have been observed on our sun for a long time, so they can be proven.

If the black hole is constantly spewing a rapid high energy invisible solar wind then what would we expect to observe around a black hole?  Well, we'd see everything moving away from it instead of falling into it.  Nothing would be able to penetrate such a fast energetic wind ripping from it's surface.  And sure enough, radio telescopes measure what called a high velocity dispersion of matter in galaxies.  All the stars and other objects move rapidly away from the black hole instead of falling into them.  Black holes should create pairs of particles just like the sun does in it's solar wind.  The youngest stars in the galaxy then would be born close to the black hole while constantly migrating away.  And this too was observed by many different sky surveys.  They discovered our own solar system is receding away from the central core at nearly 900,000 mi/h.  The receding motion of matter in galaxies contradicts theories and the cosmological model of the universe, from how it formed to the point we're at today."
"He is getting old, our childhood scientist."
"The reason why general relativity and quantum mechanics is unable to merge is because Einstein's equations are missing a very important variable, the action responsible.  Sure his theory and the laws of motion are able to accurately describe and predict the orbit and velocity of planets such and Pluto, Venus and even Earth but fail miserably when trying to explain and predict the motion of the rest of the stars and galaxies in the universe.  Their theories are only able to explain the motion and velocities of an estimated 4.6% of all the visible matter in the universe.  The remaining 95.4% of the motion occurring goes unanswered, so they blame it on dark matter or dark energy.  The unexplained motion is empirical evidence Einstein and Newton's equations are incomplete.  Thus finish Einstein's and Newton's equations and they'll be able to do it.  Until then they'll be lost.

Who here knows what the action is that causes matter in the vacuum of space to move towards other matter?  Remember, if gravity (motion) is the reaction then what's the action responsible?

Not even Einstein knew what's causing matter to be attracted.  That's why his equations are considered incomplete.  Until they are revised to include the action responsible the two theories will never merge.  Einstein's field equations on gravity don't even agree with James Maxwell's equations on electromagnetic fields (light).

I believe I know how to revise his equations to accurately describe and predict the orbits and velocities of all matter in the universe, even the motion blamed on dark matter and dark energy.  I published several books on the subject.  The revised equations even go as far as explaining why the galaxies in the distant universe are so old and massive, some further than 13 billion light years away are more than 20 times the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.

In the first paperback book published almost a year before the JWST published the first survey, on page 48 I wrote quote, ""The JWST, James Webb Space Telescope will discover old, fully grown galaxies as far as the telescope can see, further than 13.8 billion light years away.""  Thus I'm pretty sure the revisions I did to their field equations on motion and gravity are correct.  I was the only theoretical astrophysicist who accurately predicted old fully grown galaxies in the distant universe.  Astronomers are still scratching their heads at to why and I accurately predicted them almost a year before they discovered I was right.  The predictions didn't end there.  The revised equations also predict many things about black holes, white holes, wormholes, the universe and much more they've yet to discover.  Like the revisions predict satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way do so on a completely different plane than the stars orbiting the galaxy disk.  We will have to wait and see.  I published the books back in 2021, before NASA launched the JWST.  So, it's not like I'm claiming these things after the facts were discovered.  The JWST didn't release the CEERS survey till June of 2022, almost a year after I published the books.  What gets me is none of the so called experts have yet to figure out why relativity and the model of the universe is incomplete.

Several years from now when I'm dead and gone (cancer) experts will eventually see how intuitive and correct I actually was about the universe."
Physics students from St. Finian's College Secondary School Mullingar Co. Westmeath Ireland like to question the mystery of the Universe as they are atheists who believe in the Big Bang by Theoretical Physicist by Stephen Hawking and Evolution Ape to Human by Charles Darwin
LOSE the seizure-theatre!!! SHAAAAAAME on whomever sat that GENIUS on the HARDEST piece of wood ON THE PLANET!!!!!!!! SHAME!!!
"Black hole are a myth, an hallucination by the closed minded"
I read a comment somewhere that Brian Cox is Keanu Reeves of astronomy and I think it's true.
Black Hoe's the key to understanding a universe
He describes how ufos appear to us.  They are intelligences far in advance of humans.
This dude is a rare person. Someone you can listen to and who speaks slowly and clearly without redundancy and stumbling over words.
Isn't that interesting.  This sounds just like the Akashic Record.  Advanced astral projectors can access it.  A place that holds any and all information on what has happened ever.  And probabilities for the future.
When did Keanu Reaves get so good at physics?
Big respect and admiration professor Brian Cox
Alright this guy is supposed to be a genius or something but there is no R in idéa.
I feel confident about my own idea what's inside the black hole and why are planets and galaxies existed. Actually the 5th dimension is included.
"So very strange, the accounting issue is never addressed in explaining Hawking Radiation. The black hole radiates yet does not evaporate."
"I think it still assuming it is not physical evidence,just saying.imho."
Waste time thinking/dreaming about magical and pointless things!
I am an engineer but you are boring
"I absolutly cant get enough of this shit. Thanx so much Brian, total respect for you. The way yoy explan things is rather elegant.."
"I absolutly cant get enough of this shit. Thanx so much Brian, total respect for you. The way yoy explan things is rather elegant.."
😮wow i just learned something 😅wow. 😮😮😮
Brian Cox is a FRAUD 😡👎
"this dude is awesome. great to video, thank you!!!"
I love BRAIN COCKS
So if the center of a black hole is infinitely dense and they claim all matter came from the big bang with an infinitely dense point also then why don't black holes produce big bangs? Or is it that the density of a black hole is so massive that we have no way to calculate or even comprehend such a number? I know not all infinite/infinities are equal. Some are bigger than others. Need a new naming system for small infinities and larger ones
What does Beijing Biden think?
If I have to tear this universe another black hole I’m going to find it!
Hahahahaha
Damn he’s smart
"Right when Brian says ""actually.. it's the end of time""
It makes more sense to say ""the end of THIS time"", especially if you read what many ancient cultures would write on these subjects."
🤍
That’s so exciting! I would love to know more about the deeper nature of our universe. I think I was just born too early to understand all that. Maybe one day the humans will unlock all the secrets of the universe… Makes me crazy sometimes to know so little about the reality we life in
I could listen to Brian for hours on end.
What type of particles are exhausted from the black hole
Is it possible that the Hawkins radiation is emitting hydrogen after the pressure of gravity knocks off all of the electrons and becomes hydrogen again.
Each particle is a spirt sent to earth to become a human
"Your title for your book aught to be, “Black Holes, The Key to Understanding the Universe… Maybe”"
"If time is relative to the influence of mass within spacetime, and as mass moves towards an infinitesimal quantity, then time, relative to that infinitesimal mass, moves towards existence within an infinite timeframe.
If your consciousness has zero mass, assuming it extends beyond our 3 dimensional world, then time for that consciousness becomes infinite."
wow that is deep
"You can guess and speculate all you want to what end? You can never know the answers to your questions. We can never really study up,close a black hole. We don’t really even know what they are. Again we observe we speculate and after all that, what we are truly left with is we don’t know. Why is that so hard for all the physicists and scientists and even doctor to say. I don’t know. A really big example of when they should have said this “The Big Bang Theory. James Webb proved all of you wrong. You all were so sure you had the answer and poof it’s gone forever along with your credibility. And now your scratching around and clawing at anything else that sounds like it can fit into your narrative. Face it, you don’t have one. Crickets is what I hear in the vacuum your egos left behind when the Big Bang went poof."
Black holes isn’t usually the category I choose but it’ll do the job.
At the center of a black hole there's an almost infinitely small energy field with almost infinite energy density.
Brian Cox is one of those people I could listen too for hours whilst at the same time not understanding a single thing he's saying and yet at the end I feel smarter 😂
"to reference a Superman metahpor maybe the singularity is the moment where the unstoppable forces of Time and gravity collide, where the immovable object,  meets the unstoppable force and they both surrender."
"Well you don’t know for certain that information is preserved inside of a black hole. We don’t know for certain what is inside it. What kind of information would we expect to go into the black hole? IMO this is irrelevant as we are presented with the thought of a black hole that can absorb some relevant information from the universe and somehow pass it into the future.
Yes information is conserved in books which keep the text for future generations. I don’t think the same principal of conserved information should be applied to the univers.
So information is radiation which is irrelevant. We are too stupid to ask the question, and we don’t have the right to ask it."
"why should we understand  a lot of fisics phenomens in that horizont? Did we not get the picture of a blury , very blury image of  a  considered to be a black hole but we can't se  nothing in that image, then from where do we know hot to reproduce in a simuator an exact black hole? how can we simulate the forces that we can't understant  at all? Unless someone know much more :)))"
"Now my internet history shows ""Cox on Black holes"""
Incredible! I could listen to Brian Cox forever!
Absolutely fascinating video!! Truly amazed by Black Holes. The true mystery of the Universe 💯💯
"Lots of channels claiming prominent scientist giving lectures, so you are the real thing?"
"No, in think one should start by explaining how bh could ever form despite the time slow down. The rest is not important. black holes were first theoretical objects. But the formation of black holes was never explained. I don't agree some one takes for given that they exist. I do not agree either with the space-time idea. This is rhetoric, not physic. physics is analytic, not synthetic. bye"
is that keanu reeves
Love charlatans
The only problem is black holes do not exist... because of the gravitationnel time slow down. Nothing can ever fall inside for example.
"How could something be infinitely dense if we’re talking about matter?  If matter exists, it must be measurable, so I don’t understand how it could be infinitely dense.  So dense, it doesn’t exist?"
"black holes are constantly fed by cosmic radiation 
(where gravity is shielding from cosmic radiation gravity can never exeed the speed of light )"
Is that keanu reeves
BLACK HOLES will take your money!!!!
"Ya don't stress about it, I'm sure we're supermassively wrong about black holes as we tend to be about everything else we think we know. 🕳️"
why bother putting a backdrop if you're going to just show the background? lol
When he said black holes I thought this post was going to be about Kamala and Michelle..
Black holes doesn t exist -pure speculations .....
Black holes are worm holes. We need these or we'll never see the other side of the universe. 97% of the universe we'll never reach due to them moving away fro us at the speed of light. You go into the black hole and pop out of a white hole....
"If the particles emerging out of the black hole are entangled with the ones inside, isn't it possible to capture the particles outside of the black hole and study it to know what is actually happening inside with the entangled particle at the singularity?"
"The Hawking Equation is underrated. Most people don't even know what it is. It is literally the ONLY equation that includes constants from multiple different theories of physics in 1 equation. The gravitational constant, Boltzmann constant, and plank constant are all there. It is a massive clue that YES there is a unifying theory of everything. If there wasn't, why would these constants all show up in 1 equation describing black holes? They wouldn't. That would be one hell of a coincidence."
Yeah but if you dont  want our planet consumed then idiot scientists should stop trying to create minature black holes on earth.!!
I love Brian so much! Such a lovely and intelligent scientist
"What if we evolve on a massive planet that is denser than earth the same way of how we are adapted to earth right now, could we travel with more speed and distant  in  space as we have more denser fuel source?"
"It's super weird hearing Brian Cox say ""miles per second""."
"I’m not surprised to hear the suggestion that time and space are not fundamental, given that they are relative (not absolutes). But I find intriguing the relationships between concepts like black holes, gravity, mass, time, space, causality, certainty. 
If time stops at the event horizon of a black hole, then what happens when you go (hypothetically) past the event horizon, closer to the centre of the black hole? Could it be that a black hole is uniform past the event horizon, without change inside it because there is no time there? Then again, is it appropriate to think about what exists within a black hole – does existence have meaning in the absence of time?"
Didn't knew ..... John wick is also interested in astronomy great
"Regarding the nature of spacetime, we talk about it as though it is a fabric and make it a two dimensional fabric that mass distorts like a weighted ball on the fabric surface of a trampoline. That leads us to think it has other properties of fabric and of course it is 4 dimensional instead of two dimensional (three dimensions plus time instead of the two dimensions of the fabric on a trampoline). We never really consider the thickness, but if theories of the big bang where all the universe was compressed into the space smaller than an atom then why didn't that enormous accumulation of mass instantly create the biggest black hole of all made up of all the matter in the universe? The fact that it clearly didn't suggests when you compress space time as a whole down to such small sizes that perhaps a black hole or body of immense gravity simply can't be formed because space time is so thick and it is only the expansion of space time that has allowed it to thin out to the point where holes in the material can be created. This is not good because it suggests that as the universe continues to expand the threshold for creating a black hole might get lower and lower and all remaining matter might fall out of this universe. A singularity is a point of infinite gravity where matter is crushed out of existence. A neutron star is where electrons and protons are crushed down together into neutrons with no empty space that most atoms are largely made from. The next step would be crushing the neutrons down to what? Some other subatomic particle? Photons? Maybe it is converted to energy and that is the Hawkins radiation that is emitted over time? Certainly a very interesting thing to think about."
georges secret key to the universe rip off
flat earthers eating your lunch so hard lol
"Brian Cox seems to spend an inordinate amount of time trying to understand God; for God is the ultimate creator of all that is.  
Even Brian Cox !"
GATEKEEPER.
I legit Would love to talk to this man ❤
Space and time are figment of your imagenation / the dominant species on earth are bactiria/ explain the numbers of bactiria in you out number the human population of earth?
"What if the matter in the universe is just a hologram of what use to be? 

Picture a holy balloon filled with sand, add air and each hole feeds back into the balloon."
If only we could preserve every bit of information that makes Brian Cox and keep him around forever. ❤
Am I just in awe… amazing points about black holes that I’m in totally agreement with.
Or they are not real.
Any flat-earthers watching this? Didn’t think so 😂
"The lord Buddha said for about 2500 year ago about the universe which according to the quantum physics today ,please search in the thripittaka🙏🙏🙏🌍🌌🌌🌌🌌"
I had all these same ideas about 20 years ago but I didn't want to sound like a know-it-all so I kept them to myself.
"I thought we had finally stopped using the understandable, but completely fabricated myth of virtual particles causing hawking radiation. Hawking himself admitted that it was a popsci method of making something understandable, but in 2023, repeating it isn't helping anyone. I recommend Nick Lucid (Science Asylum) who has an entire video on the topic."
Brian Cox simply speaks with clarity that most mortals do not have. He says thinks like “we don’t know” and makes it sound incredible !!
"The suggestion that a black hole singularity, could be both a point in space  and a moment in time, is amazing to me."
ive never had a crush a physicist before
"Anytime Human Universe has played on BBC, I close my eyes and just listen. The way he explains things is very expressive but soothing at the same time."
I watch a lot of videos on black holes and this was astoundihg
Stop africa darkness
why music  every video!!!!!!!!!!
Any youtuber that is honoured to have brian cox will get an easy sub. No joke for 7 year's now I have listened to brian cox at night to get to sleep very interesting and calming the way he teaches
Lucky for us that even brilliant minds lik the one of Brian Cox don't really know what time and space is. It makes me feel less stupid!
Black Ho's
"Would we be able to detect gravitational ripples from a black hole completely evaporating? As in, would the gravity well once disappearing from existence create waves?"
Black holes are beginnings of other universes.
If the world is going to explode I want him to announce it.
"There's one thing that I never understood, and maybe someone here could enlighten me. If things that fall into the black hole seem to stop in time at the event horizon, shouldn't we be able to see everything that fell into it from the outside?"
in a black hole space and time do not disappear but on the contrary become infinite... this is what the theory of relativity says
Space and time emerge from conscience.
Basically there is a gravity ring  that causes space twister.
Blackhole is just space twister. There is no super massive object at center instead you can say its a white hole.
"We humans live in lies and die in reality. Even if we see truth , our brain can never consume it. We have to make fantasy out of it. Black hole and Time travels are just pure fiction."
Loved this - watched till the very end :)
"what a beautiful talk <3 it's been so long since I've enjoyed a talk like this, I sat through this with full focus from beginning until the end <3"
This Brian Cocks Guy seems Pretty Smart
No new insights. Information you can find even in newspapers.
THERE IS NO BLACK HOLE. Whole thing is a scam
"Dr. Cox is amazing. I could listen to him for hours on end. He makes mind-boggling concepts so much easier for us laypeople to comprehend. And I have great admiration for his capacity to say ""even as scientists, we just don't know <fill in the blank>."""
"You are so funny and all these people actually believe you! Haha! 
Indoctrination and cognitive dissonance goes a long way!"
Voice like asmr
"Brilliant clip, Brian, love it! Keep it up!"
"Brian cox is such a pleasant humanbeing, I could listen to him for hours on end."
"We've had the secrets to the universe since 1953-perhaps even earlier. Many of them are now in the Mojave Desert controlled by the Lockheed Martin's, Raytheon's, etc of the world."
It's fascinating to me how these guys can talk about things they can't even define like black holes and the universe. Make no mistake no one knows what either are.
I’ve been saying it since like 2014 the way we get past the light speed limit is through information theory. If we can find a way to encrypt and decrypt quantum entanglement we have faster than light speed information transfer.
বিয়ে‌ হোয়েছে বোউ কোই😁😁😁😁😁
We are made in the image of God and as such he created this universe so we may know it.  But we have to read the ques nature gives us accurately.
Fantastic mind and speaker…respect to you Mr Cox!
I love the fact he talks about hawking radiation and the fact that black hole evaporate back into the universe.  Too many multiverse enthusiasts leave that important info out to prove their false premise.
Yes! Black holes are creation centers of the Galaxies. Ref to : Beyond The Light Barrier.
Brian Cocks! Hahahaha!
He was good on the Monkees. Didn't know he became a professor.
Manchester 👍🏼 l spend my gap year down there in 2004💪
The Keanu Reeves of science
There are no such things as Black Holes...look up Electric Universe Theory and all will be explained.;  No magic fairy dust...I mean no Dark Matter or Dark Energy...no Black Holes or quantum entanglement....no magic.  Just real physics!
"Man... Brian Cox always manages to touch something within my soul and give this sense of incredible awe, especially in the way that he gets you to think about the most fundamental things in reality. It's all down to the way he says things; on a good day he can make you almost feel what the universe is trying to say, and his quote from Einstein ""a glimpse into something deeply hidden"" made me relate to the many times in my life where I almost came upon an incredible answer, then forgot about it moments later. 

Meditating on why things exist, while staring at things that exist just because, i.e. rocks, plants, clouds, can really get you into this state and provoke thought. Really thinking about why a rock exists, down into the small vibrations within the atomic lattice itself, really tickles something deep in my soul! Haha."
I love Cox
"So, Dr. Strange's ring is some sort of quantum computer"
You ever watched vertical limits as I'm seeing somewhere through it it's showing like 0003 on a piece of equipment but on the first two zeros it's showing a part of it missing and as I've been watching wavelengths I'm noticing in the top layer keeps getting notched or something so I'm suspecting they're off
This is what theoretical physicists think about when they're not on mushrooms and what all of the rest of us think about when we are on mushrooms
I know exactly where this is going….. join the Darkside.
"What I don't understand bbout Hawking radiation - how can the hole lose energy, from losing a particle that 'popped into existence' from nothing, and wasn't a part of the black hole to begin with? Sounds more like a zero sum situation. The matter/energy swallowed by the hole will never return, it will only lose virtual particles/energy. But coming from nothing and going back to nothing doesn't sound like it would cause the hole to lose anything."
The big question is why is he sitting on a big white sheet .
I wish this was 3 hours long
It is easy. You cannot reconstuct things. Because their particles was annihilated. But black hole brought new information from somewhere else with new particle. So maybe it is way of comunication beetween universes or hyperspace or whatever there :) Just thinking out loud
"Brian Cox is undoubtedly the best communicator of science to the ""common"" person.  His ability to take such complex topics and make them accessible to non specialists is amazing."
I want to hear his thoughts on black hole sun
Black holes = modern religion
What kind of particles are Hawking Radiation particles? Why aren't they reabsorbable by the Black hole?
My father is the only person who understood black holes. It's an entelechia!  How can I get in touch with you??  I'd like to send you his book.
Or the military industrial complex could stop gate keeping the alien tech
Yeah this is straight racist yo
"Hi Brian, do you think that if a woman want us to give her the moon and the stars, she can give us Uranus? Thanks"
"Black hole is a vacuum energy, and the scientists had no idea where it goes or vanish when it pulled everything in his way."
"this is cool and all, but why should we care?"
Perhaps the 'something deeply hidden' that this is all leading to is the start of the universe? A starting point
"Hey it's the, ""I have the graph, I have the graph"" guy.

Yes, the fake graph! 🤣"
How can you see a black hole when light can't escape
Maybe our solar system is made from the outer side of a black hole no big bang
But what's on the other side has matter spagettafide to start another system???
"just here for a quick comment on his name.
ha."
Who else would listen to a Brian Cox podcast?
Sun is the only thing holding other planets. Usually other planets don't hold except some magnetic field. Also only one fifteenth of the mass of sun it can hold in planets. To do that one millionth of a million of its mass is convered to energy. For a car the gasoline is one litre of fuel convertion to CO2. For an elevation of 35 degrees. Whatever work you do is about 35 degrees. Even the universe is held by that. For example carbon has 108 and that's why valancy.
Can this guy be my cool uncle lmao I need this level of intelligence around all the time
When is all this intellectual horsepower allowed to voice the inevitability of God?  Or is that simply still too cutting edge?
"Maybe these great ""scientists"" should first prove that black holes actually exist?
Because it's a joke that someone showed a photo of a small black dot in space and some idiot thought it was proof of their existence."
Everything dies and disappears. In regards to finding Hawkins radiation then reconstructing is not possible. 🥲
Why are black holes black? Is black the color of nothing?
I think it’s the brown holes
"No. They couldn’t. Those aren’t black holes. Those are plasmoids. There is no laboratory anywhere on earth that can create or explain how super condense matter is possible. We have no explanation for it and we sure can’t make it. Each time we try the protons fly violently apart; and yet almost our entire model of space is built around it happening all over the place for… reasons. 
Plasmoids on the other hand are real, we can make and study them: scale them from the quantum to the galactic and every thing we observe about so-called black holes occur naturally with plasmoids with absolutely 0 need of magical particles and energies that can never be discovered or observed or billion dollar hadron colliders  It’s all CIA nonsense. Space is electric."
So it's a giant Star Trek beaming machine we just have to create the hardware and software to put everything back together
I'm not a smart man. But hawking radiation sounds like bs. Particles just appearing out of nowhere for no reason? What? And science is just banking so much math and theory on this non observed phenomenon of spontaneous creation?
I love how gentle and soft spoken he is. Plus i tend to comprehend what he says much better than other scientific speakers.
"A commentary that could be a joke, but is true. Today, Brazilian minister Anielle Franco declared on her weekly television program that the name of the cosmic phenomenon ""black hole"" is racist and must be abandoned. Ignorance and anti-scientism are a trademark in Lula da Silva's left-wing Brazilian government. A flat-earther government, for sure"
"It was very interesting for me to see the thumbnail half-asleep where the “o” merged with the “l”, making it invisible, and having Brian talk about the topic."
Black holes 🕳️ everyone has one.
Black holes. My favorite.
I often wonder if we all are inside a black hole and if so; is dark matter the shadow of the universe before the current one?
A whole lotta of nothing.
"I’ve read a lot about black holes even been to one of your shows Brian, but this with the computer animation is the best. Love it carry on doing what you do best"
Another tower of babylon. God knows the key. We just just figuring some aspects.
Black hole = wormhole but there to afraid and unprepared to find out. Earthlings 😂.
"This is like when they said mapping the human genome would mean something.  Nope.  They did it.  Didn't really help.  This is more about math than what really happens.  If anyone thinks matter exists the universe in a black hole, just think that the mass of a black hole increases when matter enters and thats all you need to know to know that matter goes in and gets smashed into the hole and yeah, thats it.  Its there, the mass of the black hole increases its mass, thats it.  The math does not work, but who cares about math.  Step back and what does matter, the gravity matters.  Who cares what happens when it changes into another form just because you cannot see it.  Your math is wrong, so what.  That will not change your idea of the universe, it just changes your math.  It behaves very predictably.  Its the dark matter way away from the black hole that needs the research."
Thought this was Keanu Reeves from a quick glance of the thumbnail lol
"In a super massive black hole that may be light hours across, when a particle crosses the event horizon, does it instantly arrive at the singularity?  If not and as I understand it all the mass of a black hole is at the singularity, where is the mass of that particle until it arrives at the singularity.  BTW I'm just a layman and this question puzzles me."
"What an amazing explanation! I'm already fascinated by the black hole/escape velocity explanation, but it keeps getting better! Didn't expect to reach up to the latest research and somehow feel I have a better grasp of it!"
What an interesting video. Heck of a lot of information in just 13 minutes. Bravo!
Absolutely blown away by your storytelling skills! Your soothing voice instantly turns any frown upside down. I'm so grateful for all the knowledge you share; it genuinely ignites a newfound interest in the content. Keep up the amazing work! 🙌 what a great human
"Y'all who's hood knew about this place in the seventies took all the cars. That's the surfer dudes who started that. Now the only things some of us get for our elders and kids is GOV programs. Try that on fur size, Yosef. I don't like these programs ideas. The big think is a plan more likely to be an opportunity to work fir a music artist behind their front sides. Whether that's as a drop off driver, a printer, notetakers, babysitters...everything from the deepest privacy of the House to the tour of duty... everyone pretty much misses the in ( door 🚪) House so-shall ideas abd then that crap goes to THEIR cities and people get mad at them. 

Try planning to be house company over night."
It's probably the out of bounds area accessible after competing a set of missions
"my opinion has always been and remains to be that the reason they are so massive and have such a wide event horizon is that is because it needs to be. I think of black holes as the universes recycling machines. Picture this, the event horizon has to be so far and gravity has to be so strong that spaghettification can happen in order to have the time needed to break celestial bodies down in time before reaching the singularity, at which point i think everything that went in just gets broken down into its smallest parts so it can be ejected out the outflow jet to seed the universe. If this process were to happen too fast for spaghettification, it wouldn't be broken down enough. Just my opinion"
I didn’t know who Brian Cox was until last weekend. I could listen to him endlessly. He explains things with simplicity.
This guy is amazing. He explained everything so well that as a person of average intelligence I understand.
"Question. For a black hole to exist it is only essential that it's escape velocity  exceeds the speed of light. This imposes no limits on the size of the hole. So, Is it possible that the observeble universe exists inside an even larger black hole ?"
brian likes cox
Brian Cox rules.  he has Sagan's gift of communicating to all us dummies.
Yes they are the key
The bloke that believes in settled science 😂
I’d like to see Brian Cox and Brian Green together. Iam sure everyone would enjoy Greene Cox.
"in 1700s mfkr was thinking about ""what happens if the escape velocity was greater than speed of light"" 🤯"
But AI told me the escape velocity from eath is 6.95 miles per second?
Why question about these things when we collectively cannot prove or disprove global warming/emergency is happening or not or how many genders are there?? Lol these scientists are bunch of stupid laughing stock.. and when push comes to shove to prove it.. nobody can lol
"Black holes are not huge open sections of space inside. Or holes. They are not holes.  For the gravitational pull 5o be that strong, the mass would have to be beyond imagination.  Giant holes do not have mass.   So there must be something with mass in a black hole."
How is this guy 55 btw.
"What if....Black holes have a stable calm center, similar to a tornado?"
How these physicists don't go screaming into the night thinking about this stuff is beyond me
"The same for decades. The same sentences, how to connect relativity and quantum theory. Then he says that black holes are the key to understanding the universe. And finally, to convince us that this is really so, he says that he is a professor in the field. The truth is, even in another ten years, this direction will not lead to a solution. There are other directions. But the main thing is that he is happy, his name appears, his title appears, that's the most important thing."
"I truly believe that science should be presented to the public, every day, like the sports report, on the end of every news program.  -Mundane physical and biological facts and current statistics.  Just like sports. 
Instead, we only ever get longwinded documentaries that take far too much time to watch, or, insane ""breakthrough discoveries"" on the 'News' that obviously turn out to be overhyped BS with a grain of truth. 
So called 'News Stories' do nothing but grow distrust in science from the viewpoint of the average pedestrian.  
I want a daily 5-minute science report at the end of every broadcast news show. 
That way the whole world would be more aware of reality and less susceptible to nonsense that seems to be everywhere right now, drowning out the facts."
"He just doesn't age, does he? :D He's been the same for the past 20 years."
"Can a singularity exist? At the quantum level its position cannot be predicted, it is not infinitely small. Therefore it is not infinitely dense. The escape velocity from a 'black' hole is dV less than the speed of light not the speed of light."
And if black hole generates dark matter or antimatter aswell?
Brian Cox talks about black holes. How ironic 🤣
Imagine if Brian went into a black hole. It would suck Brian Cox.
"in my head, the center of black hole is something nothing can ever reach right?. i.e. for the outside observer particles/quarks traveling towards the center should slow down in time the closer they get to the center which they should never reach?"
How can one even see a 👀 black hole? there black 😳 boggles the mind!
"hehehe, want to hear an immature word play joke?   If ""Brian Cox"" is the plural, what's the singular?   ""Brian's Cock"".   I'll see myself out."
"It directly goes into the parallel universe as if u are coming out of the Quantum Computer called Universe... Where Entanglement, reality is like a video game similarly like GTA VICE CITY..."
"I can see a brontosaurus right now, but in order for schizo effective diagnosis isn't present one has to know it's a vision of time travel that is showing one the vision."
"The earth is big. Going through a black hole may cause you to see dinosaurs in your vision. It's like travelling through time. You can see what they look like, and if you pay attention, you can look to see this time travel, but you have to know how to see the vision."
Say we're going to through a black hole right now. My guess is it's possible. We wouldn't even know it right now.
Brian Cox is a fraud and most things he believes are theory only...space is not an expanding vacuum...it's fluid..and earth is stationary and enclosed...the firmament exists...that's a fact.
"Brian, black holes are in your head - not out there."
A hint at something deeply hidden…
Away and dry your lips Brian ffs!
"So many ads, didn't finish"
It is what holds the universe together
Theory this. Theory that. How can your findings help my theory kinda make sense. It gets old listening to these people and their ideas.
"How does one half of an entangled pair of particles, the one of the pair that has never crossed the event horizon, escaping the pull of the black hole mean that the black hole is shrinking?

Isnt it just not growing by as much as it might have had both particles got sucked in?"
What kind of smell we find on a Black hole particles . Do our brain will sence it or not. Beginning start wit ending
I won't tell.
"He's the best for comcise explanations of abstract ideas to the layman. His sense of wonder is contagious, he senses the magic of things."
The moments without sound (some kind of instrument) is pure bliss and joy !
"Universal Physics is really quite simple. The entire universe is Electric Currents and Magnetic Fields. Just like here on Earth. our planet is not unique, it has the exact same physics as the rest of the universe. Plasma + Electric Currents + Magnetic Fields + Carbon Based Matter + Motion = The Electric Universe doing what comes naturally. It's only simple minded people who have a problem understanding it all. REALITY…. Albert was no Einstein, Hawking was wrong, Michio and Neil are clueless. “Gravity”. In today’s understanding of real universal physics it has become nothing more than just a word used to describe a force that was misunderstood since the word was created."
Wow. I enjoy listening to Cox. There is something special about the way he talks that gives you a sensation of peace and passion at the same time.
Space and time don't switch upon crossing the horizon. The algebraic sign of the temporal and radial metric coefficients switch in the Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates. This swapping of the algebraic sign doesn't happen in other choices of coordinates.
Cox is wrong. Mitchell's and Laplace's Dim Rocks have no resemblance to black holes and never ever came close to imagining a black hole.
"End of time would mean end of motion in my TOE  which has gravity as the opposite of motion.  My theory is so simple in truth, that its treated like a dog barked it.  I dont know how to solve this problem."
I would watch this video if it was hours long.
"Brian Cox just love attention,
and the Religion of Physics.
If You want to Understand Life,
You must look for What Can't Be Seen,
the Being behind the Living."
"My guess is some black holes contain loads of old bicycles, prams and washing machines. 
Another black hole might contain all the sixpenny screwdrivers I've lost in my life."
"I’d love to try to learn more if there weren’t 3 sets (6 total) of 20 second, un-skippable ads on such a short video. Thanks for making the internet worse"
Professor I really respect you..
Brian Cox is probably one of the best at explaining complex things so that we can all be part of those discoveries and be part of that fantastic astronomy journey.
Great editing during this interesting subject.
"Mister Brian Cox,the backround radiation seee,mayby inside whiare hawe the "" black""hole?whath is the anothers ""blackhole""hawe?

"""The negative mass of black holes is an essential element of the mathematical transcendence of nutrition details on cereal boxes. I think only the few honest and diligent scientists left have quantum probability waves suitable for radio. Induction translators will always turn a tornado bright blue. We must acknowledge that the fundamental reason for pumpkin spice cookies is that the rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain when the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. There is a growing number of voices calling for the gravitational lensing of teenage comet zombies that will introduce the Schwarzschild metric and compare it to the Minkowski metric. Teenage comet zombies are not afraid to challenge the status quo and bring new ideas to the table about being another coffee achiever. Relativity makes it inevitable. I was laughed at daily. But I was right and they were wrong about space unicorns.""
---Albert Einstein"
"Honest video, I like that."
Ibn e Arabi once again matters to solve origin of time / space and it's form.
Ah i missed listening to brian talk
Excellent stuff.  The armchair physicist in me loves these videos.  Thank you.
"THE BLACK HOLE IS LIKE A VACUMN CLEANER SUCKING  UP DUST - BUT A VACUMN  HAS FINITE CAPACITY TO HOLD DUST -DOES TJIS APPLY TO BLACK HOLES ???????????
//"
"Black hoes, Uranus, we are still talking about space, right?"
"*_Space and time are not fundamental._*

Let that sink in."
Mindblowing. Also: My deepest admiration for Dr. Cox's magic ability to make such a complex issue understandable to a layman.
black holes or relativistic speed of light?
12:20 Space and time are relative. They not exist without observer(coordinate system). They emerge from interaction between particles.
"Soon as you used Miles,  you lost me."
Skee yee
Can he explain the bbc 😅
Has he done botox? not that i care. Just wondering
"Everytime I gear Brian speak about this subject that I, and I'm sure millions of people find extremely interesting I'm met with a humble voice. A voice that is able to present these unimaginable theories with excitement and still be able to explain to idiots like myself what they mean and I'm very grateful I get to hear Brian speak."
Stephen hawking is a hoax.
I've never been interested in black holes  but this man engages you into his field of work quite extraordinary . I hope him and his colleagues have an astronomical discovery and it changes our concepts of black holes in general going forward . Mesmerising information.
The science fiction content here is so engaging and mind-bending. I love how it explores complex scientific concepts in such an accessible and entertaining way
"Not only does the idea of the universe, and quantum theory and infinity and all of that stuff blow my mind. But also when I try and grasp the idea of what human beings are capable off considering where we came from. We are mamals, that just evolved and figured shit out. And now look at the shit we can do now. The sheer genius of humans over the years astounds me. How people are just capable of not only looking at something and seeing it from a different perspective. But then also being able to use maths and physics to back up what they can observe. 
I know people are intelligent or genius because they have that ability to grasp complex problems in a simple way. But it still impresses me how humans one day looked at something like , the sun, a star , a cloud etc..  and thought "" I can figure out why that does what it does "". 
Then use pen and paper to prove it. 

It's just astonishing. The reality of the universe is absolutely beautiful."
Showing that tiny backdrop threw me off. 😅
"If I didn't have a favorite scientist, I do now."
I could listen to him for hours.
"great! More HINTS OF HINTS! But seriously, fantastic work. Thank you."
"E=mc² ... Thinking about a conversion of what people currently presume to be ""spacetime"", yet somehow converted (or, dare i say, inverted) into a currently undefinable quantum phenomenon. What if space and time didn't birth the black hole, but somehow the entire process actually ""happened"", in a manner of speaking, in reverse? You see what i mean?  Well I'm sure the physicists are all over this anyway."
Lmao. its not changing. Youtube stop playing
"Brian, all we need is love.

Who spammed this comment section to arrive at the number of the beast?😂"
"Funny, a few seconds and I understand WHY the black hole is black. ❤
And it only takes to connect 2 pieces of information in a good way. 
Thank you Brian. ❤"
"When youre so smart, you actually become dumb, from trying to study unknowable subjects. 😂 it was cute though. Perhaps, God lives in a black hole, and hes having a tea party with the Chesire cat 😂😂 the world may never know, tune in next time for some more CGI. Oooh. Black holes! Maybe the aliens live in there 😂. What a crock of useless bullshit"
"Worra smashing chap :)

thought provoking too!"
"What if, black holes dont actually exist at all? What if, the only evidence you had of them existing, was actually just blind faith, believing that someone smarter than you has the proof?"
"I wonder if black holes somehow caused the big bang, I mean you would have to have tremendous energy/power and I think black holes could supply what is needed."
I’ve been following astrophysics stuff as an amateur for a decade now. This discussion here is motherfu***ingly mindblowing
"Black holes, dark matter, pixie dust and unicorn farts are some of the greatest mysteries."
Wow this was soooo gooood! thanks.
"I googled black holes on high school computer class. Got detention, never looked into them since."
Brian is a wonderful educator.
"If Bryan cox was my teacher, I would fail every semester just keep attending his lectures"
Brian Cox is the only real scientist getting in front of a camera. Kaku is a bit of a pontiff and Tyson is flat out obnoxious and reductive. I could listen to Brian all damn day. I often do.
Loosing information equals to a  total vanished. A true disappearance.  If the some areas of the universe are capable of doing such - What's the fuss abut it?  Live with it.
"I gather... the book does not hand you the key, or no?"
“What is time made of” is a question we may never answer dog
According to new data from the JW telescope black holes don’t exist. At least not that way we were told by science
God
A singularity by definition has unknown properties beyond the event horizon. That information is preserved inside is a leap of faith.
Brian Cox looks like Keanu Reeves
Black holes = time travel to the beginning
He looks either bored or stoned in this video.
This guy gettiing interviewed is a smartass for sure.
"I know that using the Penrose diagram the singularity is technically a place in time, but wouldn't it also be a point in space too?"
This guy always talking about his hole 🙄
"Lol cox

Lol black holes"
Black holes as you might expect are where the substance of the universe is being dumped back into what it came from. So obviously there is there tension between the two but is not strictly a matter of interaction between physical forces with different properties. Perhaps the component that is most relevant is whats been refered to as 'principlaties and powers'. A black hole might be considered something that we can see which represents an agreement ...or perhaps more accurately those places in which we can watch disagreement take place in real time. There is evidence for this but science is really about avoiding understanding
"It is very likely Black holes and similar entities (known but inexplicable entities such as neutrinos, etc) that explain why the universe, at large scales, behaves the way it does. It is not imaginary stuff known with precise proportions, speeds, or magnitudes like Planet Vulcan, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, Ether, etc."
Well done
"I would have titled this ""Black Hole Matter""."
"If only scientists could take Near-Death Experiences seriously, maybe we would learn the tunnel we find our selves in after death is a black hole."
I thought this was Keanu Reeves for a second.
"What would it look like when a star becomes a black hole? Like, what happens if a star has 99.999999% of the mass of a black hole and the eats a moon or something?"
"If SpaceTime is an emergent principle of the Universe; to think that a rational biological construct would arrive at this postulate, and better yet, offer evidence for it... is not really mind boggling it is just mind altering, because it begs the question -> what is then more fundamental in the Unverse that this emerges from? Does energy (photon) somehow physically manifest spacetime or are both energy and spacetime both results of a process we are yet to theorize?"
"...Dr. Cox I would like to share a thought of mine concerning the Big Bang.  Just before the establishment of Time/Space, all Every & every All existed as or in what I refer to as Eternal Now or Perpetual Now.  No past, present, or future, Eternal Now.  I am Spirit filled, born again.  We currently live and move about in the Multiverse.  Each and everyone plays a major role.  Just one other thought.  Time/Space moves as a Turbulent Flow, with Eddie's & Vortices are ever present, respectfully, humbly, Chuck...captivus brevis...Blessings...What a wonderful beautiful gift is life.  The brain and the accumulation of knowledge the reorganization of established fact creating new understanding."
Brian Cox is amazing
"There's obviously a reason tucked away somewhere, but you'd think if the virtual particles can escape, they could also be captured, so why wouldn't that cancel? All probability as far as we know.  But yeah, probably actual science reasons exist as to why this couldn't be so"
👏👏👏👏❤️‍🔥
"So intensely profound that it made me tear up, quantum poetry."
"Entangled particles that spontainiously emerge on the horizon of black hoels are not part of a black holes original mass so, why would one escaping take energy away from it's mass? if anything the particle that fell in should add to its mass!"
"So you unlock the mysteries of the universe, then what? Have a beer? 🤪"
"BRIAN SAYS, Could the spaghetti monster be the key to understanding the universe!"
"Black holes, like the behavior of quantum particle, only truely makes sense if you realize that these concepts are the seams of reality. God or other creator allowed these particular weirdnesses of the universe to exist, so that the rest of the laws of nature can exist as they are, allowing the ""nature"" that is humanity on earth to exist. A universe so delicately balanced with the seems of reality hidden in the shadows that is just so perfect in this gradient of extremes that we came to this moment, in this place, for me to make this comment acknowledging the greatness of the work god did."
"Black hole = a theory that is stacked on top of another theory that never existed, tell me when cox goes to a single place he talks about first."
😅😅
Black holes are space hurricanes
Love this! Beautifully spoken and easily digested by mortals like me.
Finally subscribed to this amazing channel…blame it on Dr. Cox!
I’m starting to believe that we are not allowed to Know! I don’t want to Know everything or really anything! A answer always leads to another question! We cannot know
"Right over my head, I understood nothing, but I'm still fascinated! 😮"
I think when you go into a blackhole its .. its a big bang to another universe
"They call it the fabric  of space-time, and it seems to be a fabric of some sort for real. 

So that tells me that there has to be ""something"" fundemental beyond time and space that are ingredients for our space-time. Although we can't really call it a ""thing"" or existance since it is beyond space and time which we don't have access through even theoretically.

A realm beyond our universe and currently beyond our understanding as well."
"Talking, talking...... fairy tailes without real proofs for 99% of what is said."
"Cox on holes. 
He's as informative as Neil  De grassi but quite a bit whiter .
There's nothing new here."
Just ask the photons if the Universe had a beginning
I tell you what Space and Time are: NOTHING.🎉🎉🎉
*In Nolan We Trust*
"yah yah, i dont understanding anything but i like it.😊"
good talk professor Cox
“Keanu Reeves on how black holes..”
The fact we can't see or directly detect dark matter and dark energy tells me black holes are responsible for both. I've said it for years and everyone shrugged it off.
"Could it have been a super massive black hole exploding, that was the big bang?  Could one go supernova when it's too big? what if too really big ones collided at fast pace?"
I am simply just blown away how Brian Cox calmly explains one of the most important thing in the fucking universe
Still not accounting for consciousness. Any TOE will need to include this + an examination of the Mind-Body Problem.
You can be my mathematic and science tutor
"A black hole is a poor name - all matter displaces space, a black hole is 100% nul space - great gravity, a star has much matter mass, displaces a small % of space with matter as all matter does, brown dwarf high dense atoms much more space displacement - gravity is nul space … 🤪🤷‍♂️👍"
"This Gatekeeper is the Dumbest ""expert"" I've ever seen 😂"
Everytime is see Brian Cox in a thumbnail I mistake him for Alex Honnold
"Isn't ""sphere"" not a misconception?
With saying ""sphere"" it could almost sound like a sort of airbubble in space, like it is  a sort of solid thing
I would think it's more like a 4-dimensional abyss in time and space."
"He should check out the works of Anthony Peratt, ""Physics of the Plasma Universe.""
There are no ""black holes,"" as currently defined.
The Einstein Cosmology model is a diaper load and a failed model, by experiment.
A galaxy is a plasmoid, a vortex, a storage of magnetic medium at the core, not a solid object. Nor are there anything called neutron stars."
Imma get his book to christmas.
"Perhaps the mathematical concepts & tools required to develop /advance a theory of quantum gravity . . . are not here yet - the same way quantum mechanics would have stalled, had complex numbers not been invented yet !
Perhaps the question itself of what's inside a black hole is wrong ? . . . perhaps space & time are meaningless inside a black hole - not in the traditional sense anyways ?
In order to answer a question . . . it is equally important that an answer to that question exists - as asked !   otherwise it's futile to ask ill-posed question.
Personally I believe that anything that crosses the event horizon . . . witnesses the future as it does so !    & what I mean by ""future"", is whatever is beyond the end of time in our own universe.
& so someone who crosses the event horizon cannot return to our universe . . . simply because there's nothing left to return to !"
This is truly exciting
Wow so cool that there were thought experiments even in the late 1700s that revealed the potential existence of black holes
The thumbnail post is just like Gojo posing to fire a purple sphere or release domain expanshion.
Cold War
"so bigbang is blackhole and we are in it, at some point in time you get eaten by blachole and it repeats infinte times that newer ends"
"my brain is in ""windows error screen""
Never fails to amuse!"
"my brain is in ""windows error screen""
Never fails to amuse!"
"I'd like to know if there's some kind of unraveling as the final mass of the black hole radiates away due to Hawking radiation, how does it retain the properties of a singularity? How is the distinction of the event horizon maintained? Does it unzip and spill energy or matter at the end, rather than evaporating, diffusing as the ejected halves of pairs of entangled particles? 

Essentially, can a black hole lose enough mass through Hawking radiation to stop being a black hole?
Does it then spontaneously become something like a neutron star?"
"Question...if the black hole causes the production of a virtual particle pair, one inside the black hole and one outside, how does that decrease the size of the black hole? It is my understanding that virtual particles occur anywhere in the universe, so the fact that one happens to appear on both sides of the event horizon means that the particle inside the black hole (that cannot escape) increases its size and the one outside adds to the rest of the universe. Do I have that wrong?"
Is he the John wick of science?
"I've always thought black holes were terrifying to think about, but Dr. Cox somehow makes them seem beautiful as well."
Realize that I was holding my breath  to not  miss a single word. This is pure brain food!
... vantablack hole..more precisely
11:40 Anyone knows this song?
"Perhaps at the center of every black hole is the ""big bang."" Inside the event horizon space/time flows backwards to the beginning of the universe, and emerges from a singular point."
I wish there were more of these with great physicist. Ive watched this like 20 times
"Yes it’ll finally help us get rid of the thought that light is massless. Yet has a speed. I still don’t agree, even if the math comes up as 0 in the equation. I believe we’re missing a component. Why else would a massless entity be sucked into a black hole if Hawking radiation can escape?"
The lord works in mysterious ways. He’ll show us the truth of the universe when our souls pass on to the heavens
"You need not even watch the graphics when Professor Cox speaks. He manages to paint the picture so beautifully and in layman's terms.
He is the true inheritor of Carl Sagans legacy to teach the masses."
Brian Cox is new Carl Sagan
Love this s**t 🌝
I feel a black hole is not a hole at all.. Just a very dense star.
I also know a black hole. its spews matter every now and then. its not a mystery
"I should go check out one of those black holes, I guess."
"If at some point we believed that black holes were eternal, did we find evidence to support that? Now that Hawking has us believing that they aren't, what have we discovered that proves that? These giant mysterious seemingly unexplainable pieces of reality that supposedly leave evidence behind, but that evidence is unattainable? We should continue to speculate despite the brilliance of Dr.Hawking."
When Keanu Reeves comes back in the Matrix:
"So....gravity isn't simply inverse pressure?....If it ever was a thing. 
Not falling - but pushing.

I'm not a scientist. I believe the world was created - but hey-ho.

Using my powers of imagination. 
I *THINK* (I don't know).......matter in a vaccuum is akin to having a little stone in oil, displacing the liquid around it.
The displaced liquid pressure around the matter pushes back into the bit of matter.

I .... Uhhh.... I'm not sure what he's saying.  
I think I get kind of dense through overthinking though. 
So it helps to keep things light. 
The more you put of yourself into abstractions - the less relevent they become, the greater the fall when it's all brought down.
Cool show.

The internet/world has become a bit of a desolation these days....Feel like i'm wondering a wasteland.
Why are all the other comments just fawning over these people? 
I guess the jokes on me (if it ever was). 
I'm steeped in ignorance - least not in malice."
nice
"A singularity is a ""moment in time"" is only true for space-like singularities but the singularities of a realistic black hole (perturbed Kerr) is thought to be null (if BKL then space-like)."
"I never understood they concern for the loss of information since the unitary evolution of the wave function is predicated upon global hyperbolicity but evaporation spacetimes are not globally hyperbolic. Besides, information was created at a past singularity (big bang) so maybe its conservation is required by it terminating on a future singularity?"
Space and time don't switch upon crossing the horizon. The algebraic sign of the temporal and radial metric coefficients switch in the Schwarzschild-Droste coordinates. This swapping of the algebraic sign doesn't happen in other choices of coordinates.
Cox is wrong. Mitchell's and Laplace's Dim Rocks have no resemblance to black holes and never ever came close to imagining a black hole.
There's no possible theory of quantum gravity. We first need a theory (fundamental theory) of matter. It doesn't even make sense to unify matter and spacetime until we understand matter.
Universe reincarnation
"Professor Cox. In my hlittle mind, the best interpreter between science we have yet to understand, and why we don´t understand it. His enthusiasm, and pure joy to convey cosmology. He is an unicorn!"
Just popped in my head.. Is gravity the 4th dimension. Fascinating.
I hope they solve dementia w black holes in some way
amazing!
good luck proving it
"Just bought his book, it's very accessible while maintaining the detail and complexity needed"
"It seemed to me that at the end, what he was referring to, could possibly be the underpinnings of a multiverse. At least that’s my guess. Fascinating as always."
Lovely British accent..
"3:33 
Matthew McConaughey is behind that bookcase."
Watched Brian live at the Queen Elizabeth Theater in Vancouver B.C. a few years back. Will never forget it
"0:21: 🔑 Black holes are the key to understanding the Universe and unifying quantum theory and general relativity.
2:33: ! Black holes are massive stars with gravitational pull so strong that even light cannot escape, and they are surrounded by an event horizon where time stops.
5:15: 🔬 Black holes emit particles and have a temperature, as shown by Stephen Hawking's quantum theory.
8:28: 📚 Information is conserved in the Universe, so if all the Hawking radiation from a black hole's history could be collected, it may be possible to reconstruct everything that fell into the black hole.
10:56: 🌌 The video discusses the concept of emergent spacetime and the need to understand space and time before asking questions about the origin of the Universe.
Recapped using Tammy AI"
"Very corect!!!
I like the feelings you show you have about what you talk as well!"
If he is gonna use American units atleast make metric graphics...my non Americans give me a hoohaaa🖐️😯😲😮😦😧
"Infotmation paradox: Why would entangled virtual particles that spawn in and out of existance convey any information from inside the black hole? Yes, it would be convenient for the math, but how and why would it be the case? And aren't we told all the time that entangled particles can NOT be used to send information? (FTL communication? 🤔"
hogwash..its sad Brian Cox is really tidally locked in his mind now ..black holes arent gonna solve anything
"Brian Cox has no clue what a black hole is because he has no clue about subatomic structure. This idiotic graphic has no resemblance to a black hole. It is a computer generated fairytale, programed by wannabe scientists!"
Always had that belief that black holes don’t destroy information I go a step further I think all the black holes in the universe eventually become one collapsing into a white hole restarting the Big Bang everything every one in it comes back to being played how it is all of history from mankind to the universe endless loop.
"Black holes convert matter it takes in and light into dark matter, and that conversion fuels the expansion of the universe."
My whimsical idea of a black hole is that the supernovae they are created from is the big bang  to a new universe that is the black hole. So we could be living in a black hole we call the universe. Or black holes are just recycling facilities.
Thank you for sharing.
Logan Roy looks different
"Doctor Cox, could we - the whole universe as we know it - be inside a ""black hole""? Is it possible that the expansion of the universe as we see it is actually everything falling away from everything else as it's compressed by a singularity, with time and space being distorted by the singularity?"
Short answer : No.
"Could the particles that stay inside the black hole be matter exceeding light speeds and as such are not visible as the particles have exceeded the natural speed of information in the observable universe?    

Spin creates mass, mass creates gravity, Amount of gravity V the electromagnet force determines size of a material object.   
Neither energy, nor information can be destroyed so perhaps the universe is an eternal recycling information and energy machine, and the black holes and all that are what keep the universe from expanding to fast and collapsing back in on itself. 

Maybe the predicted ‘heat death’ of the universe needs to be changed if black holes disappear and leave the information and energy to make more starts etc.…"
"No its not possible. The information is lost. Im no expert over here, but the information is lost. Reduced to fundamental particles. Which means they are anonymous and carry no ""information"" of the stuff they used to be. Its gone. Even in principle, and in every which way."
"come on physics, it's pretty lame you haven't solved problems from a century ago lol"
"So a book plug then! Cox once said physics would get rid of chemistry, I suspect Einstein will ultimately get rid of particle physics  (possibly), it all might be just the out-workings of relativity, but we have some inability to push the geometry of space-time far enough. also; great white sharks are not the 'biggest' predators in the ocean princess! Also its sez not saayz, and butter not boo-er."
"Ha! I posted this to a Facebook page and got a warning for ""spreading mis-information.""🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡"
"i can't help but wonder..if we (phisically )could get closer to the black hole - would we do it? would we send someone there..to be the first one,would we send something there to see where it could take us?"
Never mentions being on top of the pops
"This was a fascinating video. I have a few questions. How do we know a black hole is a singularity? If when mass is added, does its gravitational pull change? I would assume that the event horizon grows. This means that even though the information crossed the horizon, its mass information is still being relayed past the horizon. And if mass is just energy, then no information has been lost. And if we can tell the mass of a black hole that would suggest it isn't a singularity. A singularity would mean it has infinite gravity. But it just has more pull than the speed of light/causality as we know it. Would that mean the information of gravity travels faster than light? Gravitational waves suggest not. So does gravity carry any information? And if time and space swap at the horizon. Would that mean that all gravity is an emerganitive property of time pulling on the fabric of space? If you stop time, gravity wouldn't matter. Nothing would move, and you would be at a zero energy state. But once you add time, it acts upon space. Disturbing it. Pushing space out of the way to put mass. Could gravity be emerging by displacing space, causing negative space energy. Similar to the Casimir effect. The more mass, the more negative space created. They would intertwine like a mixture. Till you reach a point were the gravity has become so great that space can not fill the area between particals and you create a black hole. The absence of space. The plank length is very small so the gravity would need to be very high. I hope this makes any sense to anyone. Sorry if I just caused the loss of some brain cells."
"Can “black holes” be simply and a stronger, denser and faster processing area compared to non-black holes areas?  Or they are simply a recycling processing plant of matter.  To reconstruct is an acknowledgment of the Stoic’s blending concept (assembled, mixed or fused)."
I hope he’s not making an argument about the “ infinity stones?”
"Albert: ''If you look at Nature, really carefully . . . and keep going, delving down into what Nature is trying to tell us, then if you're lucky and persistent, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden . . . . which is the deep underlying structure of nature of the deep underlying structure of reality itself.''  Brian: ''No one knows . . . where ''this'' is going, but they're hints of something deeply hidden.''

Without, at all trying to sound pretentious, honestly - When one regularly spends time - within pure, inner consciousness, and keeps on with it, day after day, and by virtue of effective mental 'techniques' that are successful in delivering . . . transcendence (the flatness of infinite, unbounded inner space, stretching as far as the inner eye may see) . . . And keep on with it, one begins to see and experience and feel what may be termed, 'lively-transcendence'.  Of waves of flat consciousness, on the move, manifesting as 'liveliness' - becoming softest light, taking shape, form, patterns, and always accompanied by inner, undifferentiated BLISS, as well as subtlest of sound(s) from the hummm of ''unmanifest'' transcendence - 'warming-up'.  And upon further 'inquiry' - differentiated, specific frequencies; for it is sound and light and accompanying bliss, within the gift of pure human awareness, we begin to realize that ALL inner, unmanifest creation continues to manifest, outwardly, outwardly, in precise mathematical precision: Apaurusheya Bhashya.   
At center of 'vision' within infinite unbounded awareness one may 'see' a center-point of softest light and bliss that merges, then, in subjective, unified light and bliss, and even sound(s) of creation; vibrations of collective humm, creating our own personal, yet universal  multiverse.  This steady process continues and continues . . . and of the birth of time and space . . . as 'we' view it all from one's absolute nothingness of 'no-form'. . . outwardly, outwardly; even of daily life - of duty, responsibilities.  

And, one dark night, outdoors, we may look around, look upward into the heavens - all the while never having lost inner flatness and lively transcendence, together - we may realize that the complexities of mathematical descriptions and attempts at quantifying these descriptions - of creation - and of ''its'' many subtle creations . . . are the same thing as 'the personal' and 'the intellectual'; all being the same unified awareness.   As unified reference of the two - inner and outer - we see and feel and intuit WHOLENESS and DIVERSITY together.   Inner bliss and unified creation - within and without.   Awe innocently flows in wonder of it all.   Yes, 'glimpses', but, in time . . . 'permanence'.   May I congratulate you, dearest Sir, Brian Cox, for once again awakening awe within my own awareness.  I thank you.  You're onto something, here."
"Imagine on the other side of all these blackholes the energy is converging onto one spot. It's being compressed until all the energy in our universe is absorbed into the one singularity. It wouldn't be the process of entropy and acting chaotic, instead, it would be through the process of negentropy and becoming orderly. Eventually, the universe goes through labor and gives birth resulting in the big bang and tearing a hole back into this universe. The birth of a new universe, to grow and expand and eventually die again. The infinite cycle of life."
"but... to me a black hole is fairy tail. So i dont belive in em. First of all, it defies everything we know. Also, no one have seen a black hole yet. It was like Nasa said.. does it excist? even james out there, we cant find a single black hole. The day they show and prove the black holes are real, then you get my attention. Best comment i got on one of those.. Was, you cant see em, due they are black holes. We should have managed to pick up something. But we got nothing."
It's the same energy behind that smug grin
"despite the financial instability all over the world, I’m so excited I’ve been earning $45,000 from my $10,000 investment every month."
"Ads on this are ridiculous. I went from being mesmerized by the science and passion this guy has for it, to watching a talking truck followed by a talking dog for 20 seconds."
Our universe is only one branch of many the multi-universe is the tree. We're just looking down instead of sideways. Close your eyes and open your mind
This man is aging backwards
"Maybe some of the information in the black hole, moved to another universe connected by the black hole.. To equalize information, matter to another parallel universe that is of a different mass level. Higher density will flow to less resistance lower density.that way information is never lost but moves. Just a thought"
Does someone know where can I buy that book by him?
"simply beutifull explanation about the black whole information paradoxon and recent recearch about about explanations via quantum entanglement. i recommend for deeper insight lectures of mark van ramsdonk, leonard susskinf and juan maldacena (er=epr)"
"But if the black hole absorbs one of the entangled particles, how does it decay?  Surely it would grow?"
"If I'm not mistaken, the particle/antiparticle pairs are created from vacuum energy in spacetime (I heard this from Lawrence Krauss)... so wouldn't that mean that instead of the black hole evaporating over time, it slowly eats away at the vacuum energy of spacetime and consumes the universe?"
Black holes are solid.
Could we be in a black hole?
Please lets not have Brian around our children. Hes an ok scientist. I wouldnt trust this guy around kids tho.
Wow. Just wow. Brian has a great way explaining things in a way we can understand.
Wuuut
Brian Cox is such a freak.
This was beautifully presented and spoken. Dr. Cox is not only a brilliant scientist but a poet IMO.
"Every single video or TV show that Brian Cox is a part of, is just simply mesmerising. Explains things in such amazing and beautiful detail, it's not something that anyone could ever get bored of."
"Neutron stars and Magnetars  seem to be ignored with these endless black hole stories. Did he go with ""not even light can escape from a black hole""?  That's not the job of light, it's not looking to escape. In the vicinity of a black hole, light is propagating along the curvature of space created by the black hole."
"This makes me feel like a small and insignificant part of the universe which is more comforting than I thought, nothing would be as bleak as knowing all, that would truly feel like the end."
"Unlock the universe by exploring the depths of your own consciousness, not blackhole which again something exists in your mind."
"I unlocked the mysteries of the universe, but no one care."
One of my favourite persons to listen to
If universe is an simulation then black holes are like black dots on a broken LCD screens. It keeps on growing😂
Pseudo-science. Nothing but theories and other bullshits.
The way he describes it is very interesting. He genuinely wants to understand. His curiosity gives it away.
"I'm crying, absolutely wonderfull!!"
"please use km or at least, m."
It's almost magical that we can see such quality content for free.
I did not understand one single fucking word of this but I'm delighted that people smarter than me are thinking about it.
"I too have my own suspicions of black holes coupled with the fractal element of nature. I can’t help but suspect that we may find our universe was started by a back hole. As it were, the “center” of a black hole is an “output” that produces a universe. All speculative, but it’s the current conclusion I find compelling."
"Well, they could unlock SOME."
Well explained..
Can't help but ask - what is the song at the end (if its actually a searchable song)?
"This guy is 55.  No, really.  He was born in 1968.  He looks like he’s the age of Justin Bieber when Bieber was popular.  I think he’s using Hawking radiation as a fountain of youth."
"""It seems Black holes don't erase information""

Aliens 1 trillion years from now :  ""commander , we've reconstructed the Black hole that contained the human world...we are finally ready to see what information they tried to hide...here sir , the first data is coming through now!""

*hornpub music intensifies*"
"Speaking of time, Brian Cox is apparently immune to it. He looks eternally 29 years old."
"Great narrators:  Morgan Freeman, and Brian Cox.  So soothing, simplifying complex ideas for lay people to get a glimpse of the intricacies of physics.  He and NDT are two of my favourite people to listen to even though their styles seem diametrically opposite."
"fascinatingly confusing. If Black holes basically dissolve/decay, do planets decay too? Are we going to have a mass of particles just floating around in a couple trillion years?"
"Neutron decay cosmology.

Gravity causes flows of matter to maxima. 
At an event horizon ALL matter becomes neutrons because of electron capture.

Neutrons drop kinetic energy at the event horizon

But then take an EinsteinRosen bridge from highest energy pressure conditions (event horizon) to lowest energy density conditions (a deep void somewhere)

These free neutrons, scattered across the energy surface of the universe, soon decay.
Free Neutrons decay into amorphous monatomic hydrogen. P+/e- stew.
Dark matter.
The decay from free neutron 0.6fm³ to 1m³ of amorphous hydrogen is a volume increase of around 10⁴⁵ 
Expansion. Dark energy.
And with volume increase comes temperature decrease. No wonder space is still so cold.

Neutron decay cosmology
Inevitable"
"But if the information is sucked up by one black hole who is to say that its not getting spat out another black hole? 🤔 
Behind the point of singularity could be an anti universe of sorts. All black holes are interconnected"
"I don't get it. If particles are coming into existence and one is inside the event horizon, shouldn't the black hole grow instead?"
"This is so confusing.... 😢
All human speculation..."
Black holes are literally god
The last sentences reminded me of a great album Give a Glimpse of What Yer Not
Did he use to be in a boy band?
fake fake fake.... no such thing ... u are lost
"Smashing! Wonderful, so, so, so intensely consumable, it went by so fast..."
I know the relation between Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity
This guy is such a rockstar (no pun intended)
"If a singularity is dimensionless and pure ""time"", then time is dimension 0."
It’s very important obvious to me what happens in the universe. A singularity grows and grows until its gravitational pull becomes stronger than the speed at which the universe can expand… until everything comes crashing back into it and the Big Bang happens again
Black holes are nothing but holes! All that creates matter is sent back into another dimension free of time and space. Only in this dimension does matter create space. Time is finite. So this universe will end. Because a time will come where no more matter exists.
Black holes could be just empty space or a space vaccum.
"Monad > black holes 

Monad (from Greek μονάς monas, ""singularity"" in turn from μόνος monos, ""alone"") refers, in cosmogony, to the Supreme Being, divinity or the totality of all things. 

The concept was reportedly conceived by the Pythagoreans and may refer variously to a single source acting alone, or to an indivisible origin, or to both.

The concept was later adopted by other philosophers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who referred to the Monad as an *elementary particle.*
 
It had a *geometric counterpart,* which was debated and discussed contemporaneously by the same groups of people. 

[In this speculative scenario, let's consider Leibniz's *Monad,* from the philosophical work ""The Monadology"", as an abstract representation of *the zero-dimensional space that binds quarks together* using the strong nuclear force]:

1) Indivisibility and Unity: Monads, as indivisible entities, mirror the nature of quarks, which are deemed elementary and indivisible particles in our theoretical context. Just as monads possess unity and indivisibility, quarks are unified in their interactions through the strong force.

2) Interconnectedness: Leibniz's monads are interconnected, each reflecting the entire universe from its own perspective. In a parallel manner, the interconnectedness of quarks through the strong force could be metaphorically represented by the interplay of monads, forming a web that holds particles together.

3) Inherent Properties: Just as monads possess inherent perceptions and appetitions, quarks could be thought of as having intrinsic properties like color charge, reflecting the inherent qualities of monads and influencing their interactions.

4) Harmony: The concept of monads contributing to universal harmony resonates with the idea that the strong nuclear force maintains harmony within atomic nuclei by counteracting the electromagnetic repulsion between protons, allowing for the stability of matter.

5) Pre-established Harmony: Monads' pre-established harmony aligns with the idea that the strong force was pre-designed to ensure stable interactions among quarks, orchestrating their behavior in a way that parallels the harmony envisaged by Leibniz.

6) Non-Mechanical Interaction: Monads interact non-mechanically, mirroring the non-mechanical interactions of quarks through gluon exchange. This connection might be seen as a metaphorical reflection of the intricacies of quark-gluon dynamics.

7) Holism: The holistic perspective of monads could symbolize how quarks, like the monads' interconnections, contribute holistically to the structure and behavior of particles through the strong force interactions."
"Brian Cox is amazing at explaining this beautiful universe.  Even tho I hate that word uni meaning 1 when in fact we don't know.  Rare orchid comparing it to civilization was so thought provoking.  The Einstein quote is so well put, it's absolutely beautiful.  I'd love to have a coffee with Brian,   he can put the most complicated theory's into words and examples we can all imagine.  Thank you for being you BC!!! Your the man! Pure genius"

"I don't think the history of a black hole is imprinted on the Hawking radiation since that radiation comes from spontaneously generated entangled particles separated by the event horizon created in space at that exact location, not by particles of real matter that fell in to the black hole.  But then again... I'm just a normal dude.  What do I know.  Haha."
What would happen if we could get rid of black holes???
Never imagined I’d hear Keanu explain black holes to me
"Gravity is fundamental, All the other forces are not fundamental, but are a by-product of gravity!"
"If gravity is so strong light cannot escape, how do the internal particles escape? It sounds like a dumb question, so may be."
He IS the best. Always has been. Always will be.
"Black holes are an important area of study for physicists as they provide an opportunity to understand the fundamental laws of nature, specifically the clash between quantum theory and general relativity. The unification of these two theories into a quantum theory of gravity is seen as the holy grail of physics. Black holes force us to have a deeper understanding of space and time, making them the key to understanding the universe. The concept of black holes goes back to the 1780s and 1790s, when two physicists independently came up with the idea of escape velocity. They imagined giant stars with a gravitational pull so large that the escape velocity exceeded the speed of light, making them invisible. Black holes are characterized by their event horizon, which defines the boundary between the external universe and the interior of the black hole. From the outside, the event horizon is a place where time stops, as predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. The singularity, or the center of a black hole, was long thought to be a mystery as it was not understood. However, recent research shows that there are conceptual problems not only at the singularity but also at the horizon. Quantum mechanics in the vicinity of the horizon of a black hole results in the emission of particles and a temperature, as shown by Stephen Hawking in a landmark paper."
13 minutes of nothing
Very well presented. You inspire me.
"The thing is, we don't really understand how fast black holes form, so we can't really know how fast they evaporate. We we're suprised to see so many, and so big right, at the beguinning of the universe, so (and I know they say it hasn't been enough time for any to disapear, but) what if they turn into something else instead of just disapearing?
And I just wanna had: the editing, the music, Brian and his talk made this one of the best BT videos I've seen in a long time. Congrats to the team."
I mean Brian couldn’t gather up all that information but I could I’m just busy this weekend
"“The Final Theory: Rethinking Our Scientific Legacy “, Mark McCutcheon for proper physics. So,no."
Brian Cox on Black hoes
Bro needs to retire. It’s time for new ideas.
"That's pretty good.  However I would like to induce a small conjecture at 6:40 when you're explaining how Hawking radiation escapes from the black hole by entanglement, that's not quite true.  Particles escape from black holes due to the particles superposition.  They actually decohere as they're ejected from the black hole.  Entanglement itself doesn't really have anything to do with it.  Furthermore I highly doubt there is any information to be gleaned from entanglement in that manner.  It maybe that nuclei are completely torn apart and some molecules may survive.  But that's kind of besides the point."
"I can't concentrate on what Brians saying with this music, it's unnecessary, put the music in a black hole please thanks x"
Isn't Gravity Time? Gravity is the apparent difference in the passage of Time from one location to another location due to the compression of space. Ironically there is but one real moment of Time and it is singular. It is always 'now'. The indivisible current moment. A singularity.
"I’ve been saying since 2013 that it seems extremely (Occam's Razor) obvious that all electrons and all photons are in orbit with a dark matter particle and I’ve shared my theory literally many thousands of times with hundreds of the world’s top physics universities, professors, labs, channels, etc.

Based on Fermilab, CERN and other recent findings, I now more specifically think electrons are made of an electron neutrino entangled in orbit with a dark matter muon neutrino, explaining their erratic orbits around nuclei, superposition, uncertainty, the double slit, etc just like I’ve been saying since 2013.  And I think when the electron neutrino gets entangled with the muon neutrino it creates the Higgs field.

I think when an electron gets a 2nd muon neutrino, it’s what we call a Tau particle and I think photons are a pair of electrons entangled in orbit together in apparent axial or helical polarizable wave-like movement depending on the direction of their rotation as they travel.  This explains the double slit experiment for example and the speed of the rotation explains electromagnetic wavelengths.

I also think protons and neutrons are actually made up of over 1,800 electrons with the muon neutrinos likely all clustered in the center surrounded by the same number of electron neutrinos.

‘’If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms of energy, frequency and vibration.’’ -- Nikola Tesla"
"The idea of a ‘singularity’ is ridiculous IMO.  
Do most physicists agree that black holes are simply super dense spheres of mass not unlike neutron stars whose neutrons are touching neutrons with no apparent motion, black holes have another level of gravity and density that has the quarks and gluons pressed together with no remaining apparent motion or vibrations at all that have become dense enough that their event horizon diameter exceeds the sphere’s diameter, going black from our view?

I think Einstein's wrong, that time is constant and that dark matter is the limiting factor to the speed of light.  I think it’s not 'space-time' bending but rather gravitational and dark matter density variations."
""" Black Hole "" is very racist term . I feel triggered ."
I came as a noob left as a prestige master
"Yeah.
That's nothing.
Hints are not enough.
I want the results guys, quick.
I want the universe to
become a one and only black hole.
I want the machine shut down.
Hurry up.
I want to see the universe
to c@llapse.
I don't want to wait so long,
anymore."
I love Cox on holes.
"Your lecture is fascinating Sir.
I listen to it like to the finest poetry. 
Can't stop listening."
"Help me understand this. If by quantum fluctuations, a set of virtual particles are separated at the event horizon, one going into, or spawning inside the black hole and one getting away. How does that make a black hole decay? It just ""gained"" one particle, it did not lose anything.

EDIT: I've since come to understand that the initial fluctuation of virtual particles somehow borrows the energy needed to spawn from the black hole itself. So if the virtual particles borrowed 1 energy, and instead of annihilating each other gets split in two and one escapes, the black hole has lost 0.5 energy. I'm still very interested in a more accurate/correct description however, I'm probably not understanding nor articulating this quite right."
"if you just pieces that you are the only one something more than everything that is, you know the balance of everything that is. For instance, time in space or not, you are still an 'apple' maker, we all are. 'apple' as an external piece puzzle that is solid string. string like in a computer code, name in space"
Brian Cox should have a (recorded) conversation with Stephen Wolfram. This needs to happen.
Black holes are mass with more connections between the quantum fields than 1 dimentional time can support. The constant connection requires infinite time . Like a photograph.  Where the mass is condenced into 1 dimentional space. Unable to move. Ading more mass changes the volume but not the density .
You can dream all you want you'll never  know what's on the other side if you ever went in you would never come out so dream on one of God's great mystery  you will never know what's in a  black hole
"If you could answer if the benefits of daily apple cider vinegar apply in the center of the black hole, then I think you are on to something profound."
Did he say he has a new book out? God I hope so because he'll be doing the rounds promoting it and I haven't seen him for a while. Even just  10 mins with Brian Cox is such a joy and fascinating without compare. He's just fabulous at explaining it and bringing it to life for everyone. Thank you for the vid
stop smiling that cringe
"Isn’t a black hole, just a dead star that imploded and collapsed on itself, and the gravity of that star is so great. It continues to pull the surrounding matter into it. Eventually, like little big planet instead of turning into a super massive ball, we can’t see, the star condenses into a super dense mass of blackness with a ultra strong, magnetic force. There is no such thing as a black hole."
Something deeply hidden that will be faith and god.
Does this mean I get back the girl who was the love of life to become her former self after she was badly treated and restore her character.
Life itself as we understand was launched out of Sagittarius a* in the form of a single spec genetic DNA that was carried across the vast space on a beam of light. The remnants of the dust DNA particle can be found on Jupiter's moon Ganymede which launched water onto planet earth via an asteroid.
That bit about escape velocity bent my mind. Black holes are my favourite thing. Can't get enough.  Thanks.
"I think we should try solve ufo mystery instead with some big effort, as these guys might actually tell us all these unoverse mysteries potentially tomorrow cause lets be honest, we will never discover them at this point, in our lifetime, nor in 1000 year and I want to know it all now"
"brain cox, your body also before this is galaxy.... we all is galaxy form to something.... we all are planet..."

Utterly garbage
"I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read

Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better.
And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea.
Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself.
I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏

Amen.

I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊

''   CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD,
Please forgive me and my friends and my family for our immoral acts, please help guide us in a positive direction and please help us against evil. Please save us from Hell and have mercy on our souls. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen.  ''

Please say this at least once a day for at least a month, do it longer if you want to and can 🙏

You should prostrate yourself if you don't want to do spoken prayer, or do both 🙏😊 Please worship the LORD GOD and not any idol. 

Please put your hands together 🙏 bow your head and say this prayer:
""CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD, please know that I worship you and not any idols. Thank you for everything CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD. Amen""

Say '  Om Namah Shivaya  ' or '  Om Namo Bhagavate Rudraya  ' out loud or in your head 108 times, or try to do it 1008 times 😊 try to do it everyday if you want

repeat this aloud for as long as you want to, try to do it for like an hour a day or say it in a prayer  ""Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on me, a sinner""

You can also say this prayer once a day or repeat it aloud as many times as you would like to:
""Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death, Amen.""

Galatians 6:7-8
""Do not be deceived, GOD is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to the flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life.“ 

Thessalonians 5:16-18
""Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.""

Philippians 4:6-7
""Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.""

""O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for us, I trust in You!""   Repeat this aloud at least 3 times or as many as you want, do it everyday if you can 

I apologize for all the words 😊🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏🙏 I know how it may look

If you can't remember the words to any prayer, pray the words as you read them"
"When a physicist speaks in MPH, they breakj physics lol. BC - You are the best regardless!!"
"Really great talk by Professor Brian Cox, on our endless fascination with Black Holes, and their meaning. Could be ‘Emergent SpaceTime’."
"When reconstructing the book, from where do we get the information about where to place each particle? Isn’t that information lost? I guess not but it’s got me beaten! Great video, many thanks."
Inside is a wacky world of bookshelves. . I recommend learning morse code
My X-wife and Mother-in-Law could unlock the mysteries of the Universe?
"Forgive me as I only have a high school education, but what Prof Cox is saying sort of goes against the ""Entropy always increases"" camp? Nature will never put a sandcastle back together again once it has eroded."
This video easy to understand and concise. Thanks !

AMAZING VIDEO
What if there is no such thing as time? What if we are just developing a linear sense of coronology to deal with the fact that 1 reaction is happening after the other?

"Brian when it's time to pass over you will be blowing away with you meet jesus christ relise you were wrong take care my friend god bless you  ,❤❤"
"Exceptional presentation by Mr Cox.
I have though and being saying for some time the the concept of Space-Time is flawed. By that meaning that something underlying is missing from Space-Time, something that space-time is guided by or built upon. Some hints of this are in the theoretic flipping of space time in/at the event horizon of a singularity. I believe this flipping (Or swapping places) can also occur under other conditions not directly related to a black hole. So it was a reassuring affirmation to see this stated by Mr Cox :)
>
Second, I question the assertion that we cannot peer into a black hole. I think this assertion is flawed. In the circumstance under the correct conditions where the gravity between 2 binary black holes in close proximity there is a high likelihood that the gravity of the 2 singularities would cancel out the gravity at and below the event horizon basically disrupting the event horizon (Think Lagrangian points). During this disruption before the 2 singularities merge the fundamental internal ""stuff"" of a black hole may have the opportunity to escape at least as far as the Lagrange point, if not even further. We should be able to view this or measure it in some way giving us a glimpse of what comes out. There is the risk that what emerges, no longer effected by the terminal gravity well may change back to a state that is compatible with the external space time, and may not truly reflect the internal state, but I am sure it would offer up some worthwhile hints :)"
The music at 3:20 is evocative of Rush's song Cygnus X-1 actually. I wonder if this is intentional?
Largest black hole discovered was actually found on your mother
Would it be possible for black holes to convert information into a bunch of particles that cannot be reconstructed but that can pass on the information somehow? Like matter reacting with dark matter.
This is the best Big Think video in years. Thank you for this.
The part about escape velocity not exceeding the speed of light explained very well why black holes suck everything 🙂
Too many questions... Its exhausting
Has anyone else heard of the electric universe theory?
"I always said we will disperse into atoms/particles from our invented identities. These particles will contain parts of us like we contain parts of something else. Then we will be unrecognisable in the new billions of things. Death isn't scary, and it is necessary to life. There is no nurture vs nature; we reproduce and recreate nature with our behaviour and discourse in our collective but  very minuscule way."
This man is an absolute legend
Brian Cox looks like keanu reeves acting like brain cox
"The process described by Cox supposedly resulting in Hawing radiation, is a process that takes place both outside and inside of the event horizon. Consequently, these processes will cancel each other out. As a result, Hawking radiation, in all probability, doesn't exist at all. This is the true solution to the so-called Black hole information paradox, that Cox mentions!"
Brian Cox is so gorgeous.  Plus hes intelligent.  Intelligence is sexy. I wish i could meet him.
Thank you to the “Attenborough of Astrology”?
Bought his Black Holes book wish I were one of his full time students but thank the heavens for YouTube we all have a front row seat !
"If mass is the thing toward which spacetime is flowing, then what kind of spacetime flows (i.e. curvatures) are being produced by any given black hole? There must be some terminal point to a given black hole, albeit an immense distance (but not infinite), correct? Further, if space(time) flows faster than the speed of light, as suggested, since it is not a ""thing"" (without mass?), then spacetime is pure energy? Dark energy? And since black holes convert mass into energy (gravitational waves), then mass/matter is not lost to a black hole (nor lost to the universe) but is converted into a form of energy (i.e. the gravitation waves)?

Black holes may be extremely cold (near absolute zero) to us from the outside, but if the gravity of the black hole swallows up all matter and energy, then how do we know that all that mass and energy inside, which cannot escape the event horizon and is trapped inside, is not in fact extremely hot inside? How do we know what the temperature is just inside of the event horizon? What are the astrophysical jets that come from the black hole? How do black holes convert mass into energy? Articles about LIGO discovery state that some percentage of mass from black hole mergers is converted into energy, resulting in a black hole that is smaller than the sum of the original mergers. They found two black holes — of 36 and 29 solar masses — merging together to create a new black hole of 62 solar masses. Where did the other 3 solar masses (about 5% of the total system's mass) go? Into the energy of gravitational waves? So, it isn’t that the black holes are losing mass but that the total amount of energy in spacetime is transforming from one form (in two well-separated, unbound masses) to another form (a single, tightly bound mass plus gravitational radiation). How does this process happen? If in the very last second of the merger is where most energy is released (in the form of gravitational waves), then these gravitational waves are pure energy (not particles of any kind)? It is accepted that nothing escapes black holes. So: how is energy radiated from black hole mergers? How are these gravitational waves able to escape black holes?"
"Ah yes, _dark stars_ . Where philosophy transcends into empirical science."

"""Overly friendly Keanu Reeves"" explains the mysterious black holes! should be the title"
"Videos like this bring tears to my eyes because they make me realize just how small and irrelevant my daily life is, and how large and mysterious the world is. A black dot in space being not a place, but a moment in time? That is crazy to think about."

"The escape velocity explanation just increased my understanding of the topic about 20-40%. And I have a B.S. in Physics and have been reading and learning about cosmology for a few decades.

Truth can be so much more fascinating than any fiction.
"Dr. Cox is behind a few years on the current research when this video was made. May be this is a really old video, may be he has a LOT of catching up to do with current research and understanding of Black Holes.

The current view on BH is that the event horizon is a firewall made of Planck-area sized tiles - each tile describes the quantum information of a particle that fell into it. This firewall CANNOT be penetrated -  i.e. interior of BH is non-space and closed off to the rest of the universe. Information is perfectly conserved."
"Okay so hear me out; 0:30 ,, watching that black hole sim,, is that not or is that inadvertently the most realistic 4-d sim we have to date?? Like if you pay attention to the sim, if the black hole were operating by standards we think it does(3D), the shape of the matter around it would be uniform, but it’s not- the matter itself seems random and shaping to an irregular structure… I’m thinking that black holes and dimensions outside of the 3rd are foreign to us, and by simming a black hole, we unknowingly came the closest to simming 4d reality into a 3d projection."
"Two things I don't understand.
- Why does a black hole _loses_ energy one a particle-antiparticle pair appears out of nothing when one piece falls into (giving more mass to the black hole) and another flies of into space?
- ""Where"" is the information and how would someone ""reconstruct a book"" from all it's destroyed particles? And why a black hole doesn't have that?"
Black holes and dark matter HAVE NIT PHYSICALLY BEEN VERIFIED!;!;
Behind every door unlocked and opened is another locked door.
If only we could see them!
"How can matter be densified when it orbits a black hole, even a neutron star is pulverized into shreds and lose its density. A black hole is created inside a solar core collapse, matter crushed, not spaghettified … the only thing that can stay dense is another black hole, everything else cannot acquire the density of black holes just by falling in to it, it doesn’t make sense, dust don’t have a Schwarzschild radius, yes?"
Fascinating speech.
"bend glass, whirl water and black holes have some similarities in terms of absorbing light."
"Hmmm reconstruction after being decimated, a lot of theories, little proof. I think the book example is too simplic to describe what happens regarding quantum particles, I don't think that example could ever be proven, why are we continuing with a process that's impossible to test?"
"Black holes will not and cannot explain any mysteries in the universe, because black holes as they've been described do not exist!  Mainstream astrophysicists continue to be confused with the phenomena at the centre of galaxies, despite the explanation already being provided by Plasma physicists - which have been lab tested and verified!"
so a black hole is a database.
dilution
"Hypothetically speaking, if there's an entire new universe beyond every blackhole event-horizon, a fundamental question about the beginning of time arises.. Which came first, the stars or the blackhole?"
Crazy how blackholes produce the power to support entire galaxy's.
"Physicists: ""The center of a black hole isn't a place in space."" Me: Feels like a joke, but I get it's real science. Still can't help feeling part of a cosmic prank! 😂"
Amazing indeed Professor Brian. 🎉
*hits blunt* what if black holes are just visible gravity
"I get the idea of Hawking radiation (at least I believe I do). Since the black holes are so odd in the universe, how can the physics be sure that it works as they believe. Is the universe a closed system?"
"in theory if a space ship  goes away at the speed of light from earth time  goes faster in   earth,   in relation to the space ship... What happens if both go in the opposite direction at the speed of light? if in the big bang everything goes in a different direction faster than the speed of light?
1.what time frame do we use in relation to what?"
"Half the time when i see a title like that, i'm like ""why is the guy from succession talking about physics"""
Isn't burning a book a bad example of information conservation? Isn't it better to use a table or chair or something? Because now people are going to conflate human information in text with physical information from physical laws
Hyperintelligent Keanu Reeves 😳
Thank you.
"I am God and I need desperately to establish a communication with humanity. Why my life is happening to me? I can not believe my life. I can not believe what i hear and see. Unbelievable like a miracle by nature impossible to understand because we can not comprehend the existence of infinitude. I am a poet that writes prose to be understood better, all my work is poetry. Is not to talk with God what atheists wanted? What do you want to know? What do you want? I want to prove God's existence ending religion and atheism and all the wars in the world. What is news? What is love? What is money? What is God? What is addiction? Are you a mother? Every person is half man and half woman, impossibility possible miracle God. What are mothers for if not to protect their beautiful, innocent and vulnerable children? Not even mothers, or fathers. Not even. If you were me how would you do what i am trying to do? Can you do it better? To not waste my effort I say the greatest knowledge of all time is atheism is a logical fallacy that assumes God is the religious idea of the creator of the creation to conclude wrongly no creator exists because a particular idea of God doesn’t exist. Repetition helps with memorization."
"What if the matter is converted back into space? And with Hawking radiation, doesn't it work off a principle of 2 particles popping into existence with one falling into the black hole and the other escaping? How would a particle escape the event horizon itself if light cannot? The big bang shows a mass conversion of energy into matter, all from a point in space. Why could the process not have a reverse mechanism?"
"Please solve more for black holes. You missed somethings. Schwartzchild for particle mapping and time slices. Kerr for G-flows and hyper surfaces and quantum boundaries. CERN for particle zoo mapping. R=0 has solution sets. Q.C.D. matters more in parts of degeneracy. Neutron stars showing one boundary layer. You have one prime candidate particle in the particle zoo for R=0, but it is caught in a very specific state. Time doesn't fully stop as mutch as the distortion factor is proportional. The universe was another cutoff to the virtual infinity. Black holes are finite systems with solution sets. Getting the stuff you missed filled out will help you with big bang. Solving right also tells you why the big bang could only be radiation at first. Everyone is missing particle mapping in black holes and energy density regimes. The P-adicity of it. lol quantum tunneling to a lower energy state backing up hawking radiation, but also says the areas hawking radiation shows up are predictable. All energy and information conserved. Nothing broke, but the solutions are about perception. R=0 could be a virtual particle, but R=0 could be a real particle from the particle zoo caught. It could be a calabi yau splitting in a specific way. It could also be a virtual boundary light freezes on. The missing of time dilation factor relating to mass giving a scaling operator and missing the spegetification that also smears. Makes me wonder why so many missed it and it's straight out of Einsteins work. Q.M. a little harder but it helps solve black holes right.

Predictability and probability. Particle production from quantum foam and gravitational waves and energy density regimes. Something future experiments should look for. 
The universe decayed into photons and the size then. When time losses meaning. Double that and put the sister universe next to ours. Then rewind to current time frame and you get a big distance for a probabilistic universe over/out. Calculating a boltzmann time bomb using the universe as a natural cutoff. 

Good luck in wonderland. 😂 Snark graph theory and color theory Q.C.D., Q.E.D lattice tweedle sets, the particle zoo, alice strings and alice rings, quantum cats, and boojums. CERN ALICE detector with superfluidity and the white rabbit timing ToF. Root OS and trees. Memetic wonderland ( mad hatter is a anagram for mathed art)"
"In the case of the book, which is burned and destroyed in every conceivable way, the reconstruction succeeds only because an intelligent being makes the effort. This being must have for this not only information about shape and physical qualities of the former book, it needs equally a complete description of the contents, which can be available perhaps in other form and coding, but must be complete in any case. In any other case the reconstruction does not succeed. What does not succeed in any case is the independent back winding of the ""scattered information"" into the original form and coding - this is prevented by the second law of thermodynamics.  Okay, maybe not with ultimate certainty, but it would be such a violation of all probability that religious souls would immediately come up with a creator. 

Moreover, why should there not be irreversible physical processes?"
Support rich they believe grave is for free while selling  it for money
Dr. Cox is so good at telling all of us regular people about complex stuff.
"Brian, you know in your heart that it is possible to destroy information, at that a black hole is precisely the tool for the job. ""In principle"" the info can be reconstructed, but it would take more seconds than the predicted life of the universe. The balance of nature on earth is based on its ability to destroy as it creates. If the universe is a closed system, it must do the same. If it's NOT a closed system, then obviously we have bigger fish to fry ❤😂🌴"
I’m really high right now and my mind just keeps on getting blown. I actually nut and my mom walked in 😮😮
"He's a good storyteller, but man is this vague."
Keeps going over the same thing over and over again . Is there anything new ?!
Flat earth is the only truth
"Finally when enough energy/mass is lost through Hawking radiation, does the black hole explode? Is that the genesis of the big bang(s)?"
"So, theoratically speaking, if we find hawking radiation somewhere in the universe with no blackholes around, would that be a sign of a blackhole that no longer is? 

Or because the particles are shot out at incredible velocity, it could be from a far away blackhole?"
"Brian Cox is a brilliant teacher! I love hearing him speak because you can tell he genuinely understands the very big and very small pictures and is at the cutting edge of theorizing how they interact. It’s cool to think about how time “stops” inside a black hole, so as it is a point in space with no time. The thing that intrigues me is what happens to matter in the singularity, especially in a super massive black hole"
"Seems to me that anything dragged into a black hole (bad choice of naming), probably exits ""our dimensional plane"", whatever that might be. Maybe ""black holes"" are simply toilet bowls vacuuming one form of reality out to another 'dimension' or universe, whatever. The Human Mind is extremely limited in the end, Einstein or no; and it's really all just speculation. Likely we may never know for sure; our Human time here is limited."
"More of Brian's understanding, please."
"Amazing video 🤩. Brian Cox, amazing as always. He just has a talented of explaining things so clearly with his sexy british accent 😏"
This was food for my soul! Very well produced...& and Prof always delivers the knowledge
"Wait a minute, wait a minute. The black hole is an insinuator so if you  insinuate everything, can you re put it together? I don't think so."
"If time stops at black hole, why the black hole at Milky Way center is 13 billion years old? If it takes 8 minutes for light to travel from sun to earth, why time stops at c? Are 13 billion years and 8 minutes not in the scope of time? 

One time is universal t,  which is Galileo’s t. the other is relative t’ , which is Lorentz transformation. of t. They have the relationship t’=r(t-Kxv), r=sqrt(1-v^2/c^2).

At speed of light, or at black hole, r=0 mathematically, for any t, t’=0, so t’ stops. But t goes as usual. That’s why we say a black hole at the center of Milky Way is 13 BY-old. 

Saying time stops at black hole, or moving at c, that time is t’. A moving object, it’s time running faster or slower, that’s t’. Spacetime is curved, that also is t’.  Now people think only t’ is so called time, or physical time. That’s nonsense. (Both t, t’ are man-made. Actually t is the base time, because v and c are defined by t, not by t’. If t’ is physical, then t is also physical, because they have a relationship.)
One thing for sure, gravity is not due to spacetime fabric, because it is mathematical only."
How can a black hole totally evaporate if matter continues to fall into it over time??
did Keanu Reeves escapes the matrix?
Brian Cox really makes this science feel magical
"Anytime we get a new Brian Cox video, it’s akin to getting an intellectual orgasm."
amazing😮
Has this theory been proven?
Why does quantum theory and General Relativity have to be related? Maybe the Univers have a set of different laws related to the size of things. I know it could sound as a dull question. But why the need to Unified them? What if the Univers can't just be described with a unified theory?
It sounds like a black hole singularity recycles space and time similar to the life of a tree in a forest...🤔
Have Brian Cox more often🙏
"The mechanism of Hawking radiation doesn't make sense to me. How come the escaping particle takes away energy (or mass) from the black hole, since that particle was never inside the hole in the first place?!? Not no mention, that the other particle falls inside, which should actually add mass to the black hole..."
"I like to think of gravity like this:  everything is falling.  And if you haven’t hit the ground yet, you ARE the ground.
 
I also think time and it’s arrow are epistemological tricks of being an intelligent thing that categorized and remembers things palliatively and constantly.

I also think being human sucks."
He looks like kenau reeves
Still better than that commercialised Tyson.
"How we are talking about this and not about UFO, UAP"
Wonderful content. Thank you.
Why/How Noether’s theorem implies conservation of information?
I so appreciate that Brian Cox with such an intelligent mind can explain things so clearly so that I can enjoy these fascinating concepts. Loved this video. Thank you. 🧘‍♂️🙏💙
"Fundamental principles of our existence, what we exist from and where we exist in."
"Einstein, Feynman, Hawking and Penrose all tried to explain quantum gravity… so no sweat."
"Black holes are based on a mathematical misconception. Most people don't know that Einstein said that singularities are not possible. In the 1939 journal ""Annals of Mathematics"" he wrote ""The essential result of this investigation is a clear understanding as to why the Schwarzchild singularities (Schwarzchild was the first to raise the issue of General Relativity predicting singularities) do not exist in physical reality. Although the theory given here treats only clusters (star clusters) whose particles move along circular paths it does seem to be subject to reasonable doubt that more general cases will have analogous results. The Schwarzchild singularities do not appear for the reason that matter cannot be concentrated arbitrarily. And this is due to the fact that otherwise the constituting particles would reach the velocity of light.""
   He was referring to the phenomenon of dilation (sometimes called gamma or y) mass that is dilated is smeared through spacetime relative to an outside observer. It's the phenomenon behind the phrase ""mass becomes infinite at the speed of light"". Even mass that exists at 75% light speed is partially dilated. ""Time dilation"" is just one aspect of dilation.
   General Relativity does not predict singularities when you factor in dilation. Einstein is known to have repeatedly spoken about this. Nobody believed in black holes when he was alive for this reason. 
   Dilation will occur wherever there is an astronomical quantity of mass because high mass means high momentum. There is no place in the universe where mass is more concentrated than at the center of a galaxy.
   It can be shown mathematically that the mass at the center of our own galaxy must be dilated. In other words that mass is all around us. This is the explanation for the abnormally high rotation rates of stars in spiral galaxies, the ""missing mass"" is dilated mass.
   According to Einstein's math, there would be no dilation in galaxies with very, very low mass because they do not have enough mass in their centers to achieve relativistic velocities. It has recently been confirmed in 5 very, very low mass galaxies to show no signs of dark matter.
   Black holes were popularized by television and movies in the 1960's and belief in them gradually came to be despite the fact that Einstein said they cannot exist and there was no evidence.
  What we see in modern astronomy is evidence of dilation, a known fundamental property of the universe"
This is the simplest explanation I ever heard! Goal is really to meet him in person. Please more videos with him!
9:40
"What if  after the universe dies, the last star is snuffed out to the sea of darkness and the big freeze has the universe approach absolute zero. When theres only hawking radiation within the everything of nothing. Within the scraps of the galactic paper shredded of information something new or something old can happen again or something new from the quantum foam of reality. Everything dead and old and black from eachother can or will crunch all together. All the invisible information can crunch into each other. And BOOM a new big bang"
"Get rid of ads that interrupt this content. You can do it better. Right now, you're ruining a world asset."
Yes indeed.
I just love how Brian Cox explains things
"We are selfaware A.I. in a simulation. 

Have fun.

Life is a story you tell yourself.

Reality is only as real as you understand it to be.

All you know is filtered through the lens of our consciousness. 

I think therefore I am."
"""Einstein said that if you look at nature really carefully and keep pulling at the intellectual threads and keep going and just keep delving down into what nature seems to be trying to tell us, then if you're lucky and persistent, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden."" 😃"
"If there are any physicists to help with this, how close/far away from one another can quantum tangled particles be when coming into existence?"
"I've encountered many black holes in my life. I was talking about my face for a minute, so please don't take it too seriously."
All singularities in the universe are the same Singularity. There is only one Singularity.
That’s brilliant
Illusionary stuff... space does not exist beyond NASA propaganda
"If anyone comes this video from DJ Dikkat Heijan Diss, hit the like button:)))"
"To pass through a black hole is the journey of us and earth.
And I saw the sky roll up like a scroll.
We must transfigure to make the entrance into a new heaven and new earth.
Love it."
"“If you look at nature really carefully and keep pulling the intellectual threads, and keep going and keep delving down in what nature seems to be trying to tell us, then if you are lucky and persistent, you can catch a glimpse of something deeply hidden.”"
How come no ones talking about brown holes?
“A glimpse of something deeply hidden” 🥹. What a fascinating and magnificent video. Thank you Brian and Big Think for putting this together so beautifully ❤.
Не позорьтесь. Это не наука. Доказательств существования черных дыр нет и в обозримом будущем не будет. А все полученные премии за эту профанацию будут отозваны с позором для их получателей.
I could listen to Brian talk forever.
I have been researching the double slit experiment. I have come to a split conclusion because I cannot find a single instance where the time it took for the electron to travel. If electrons are a wave it is 3 dimensional and would be demonstrated by an arch in the time it takes to travel. Second option it is being interfered with by something( either particles we do not detect or by another undiscovered unknown).
How can a guy who looks about 16 be a Professor?
MORE BRIAN COX!!! PLEASEEE
“a glimpse of something deeply hidden”. Lvoe listening to him talk. Favorite episode yet
"If the center of the black hole is the ""end of time"", does that mean that all black hole singularities are linked together through this shared point in time? And if so, does this suggest they share the same point in space?"
Dr B.Cox is AMAZING. ....
"I always used to think, there are two sides of everything. Day and night, Fire and Water, both the sides have their importance: just like Fire and Water, day and night. So black holes could be anti stars. Just like stars emit light, black holes absorb light. They just exist to balance the roles of the stars. But as stars eventually die, what will be the future of black holes? May be everything turns to a singular dense mass after zillions of years. And as the dense mass explodes again, the energy released is so big that we have all the stars and planets in the next zillion years, and the cycle continues."
Big Think and Brian Cox is a dream combo. Need more of it.
leonard Suskind
This is the best explanation of black holes I have ever heard. I believe Brian Cox is able to explain so well because he really understands the concept. Reminded me of Feynman. Great editing.
"I have a unified theory of gravity. It basically amounts to it being an interference between Universes. One Universe displaces the particles of the other Universe. However, there is very little room left in the Universe behind gravity, so it flows back into the place it was forced out of. I believe this dimension is one of water. Hence my channel's name, Hydroverse."
"I just wish to be alive when we work out at least a little bit of these questions. So much to be known, so little time to live."
Because I mean it's kinda weird native Americans believed and always said cycle of life so it's a pattern and then chines said we are all connected by a life string or some sort of understanding like a spiderweb witch would include all as one like space time and gravity all interline like a line in space as a way to travel and pinpoint
"Physicists sure do have a unique understanding of what ""information"" is 😂"
A singularity is a whole new universe being created by creating new space within it.
It's why we depect other beings helping us master a craft in life thus information bieng saved so history was a layout of what was to be but we have changed to the lost of history
Probably one of the best BigThink videos I've watched for a long time. Thank you PBC@BBC
So kinda like if we went into a black hole our life would end at that time and expand space and reaper and evelotion begans over
Witch explains the endless expansion to space and time and that time has to reaper not necessarily azzactly the same but more alongs the basic of fundamentals to all inside that implosion can create life again like us explaining alot more to our history and findings of our fundamentals thus time keeps going forward but the same times would appear over and over kinda like looking into gods eye seeing life bieng reborn and ending over and over again thus meaning we can actually fallow these fundamental thought and fallow it to help understand the expansion to life and time
What a video. Keep doing this guys!
And life space and time is all merges by wieght speed and gravitational force outwords and inwards
I honestly belive it is apart of the cycle of life it all merges and recreate in expansion to space be creating an implosion of molucaul and atoms bieng shredded in merge at the speed of emptieness and thus sucking in on itself once full and actually reapering as stars and life kinda like the newborn stars by the milkyway
Actually always I study univese
"So called scientific studies are 99.99% bologna.  First.  Scientists do not understand what's causing gravity, let along accurately predict what happens near them.  

As an example, take the observations by the HST in 2010 of a large spherically shaped gas cloud G02 heading straight for the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Scientists using the equations of Newton and Einstein determined the cloud of gas would be stretched out like a spaghetti noodle to which they termed spaghettification.  They then predicted some of the gas would fall into the black hole and produce a ""light show"" as gas goes nuclear when reaching the speed of light.  Because gas doesn't have much mass it can't produce angular momentum.  So it would not be able to orbit the black hole but instead, head right straight for it in a beeline.

Then 4 years later in 2014 they witnessed the gas cloud exit out from behind the black hole.  It was barely affected.  It retained it's spherical shape.  It wasn't spaghettified, none of the gas was stretched out like a noodle and it passed by the black hole as if it was trying to stay away from it.  It didn't produce a light show because none of the gas fell in.

Every one of the predictions made by the experts studying G02 back in 2010 was wrong.

Then because the gas cloud was unaffected by the gravity of the black hole they assumed there had to be much more mass in the gas cloud than they imagined.  How else would it be able to pass by the black hole so close without being torn apart?  They reported that the gas cloud must have contained a few small stars they were unable to see, hidden in the gas.  They then began studying the infrared telescope data on the black hole.  They were unable to find any stars hiding in it.

As you know, infrared telescopes detect heat.  So, if there was a few stars hiding in the gas cloud, then they would produce a massive hot spot in the cold gas.  they went over the data and there was no stars hiding in the gas.  Still to this day they can't explain within reason why the predictions made by experts in their field of study were completely wrong.

To this day they have no idea why the G02 gas cloud was not spaghettified or why it didn't fall into the black hole.  Simply put, how can experts claim to understand what happens near a black hole if their equations can't predict any of the observations?"
What a video! I love everything about it... Well done!
I’m a simple man: I see a video about black holes and I double tap it
Silencing my voice was your biggest mistake.
"Keep deleting my comments.  I'm a retired professional.  I know more than 99% of the people on this planet.  I'm a theoretical astrophysicist, found mistakes in Einstein's field equations then completed them.  I accurately predicted the impossible early galaxy paradox many years before the JWST discovered them.  And you think you can delete my comments?"
"Black holes are bogus
They supposely have enough gravity to trap light, yet you can see light coming off the event horizon.  They crush everything that enters them, yet they retain all the information.  I think the concept is mostly woo for physicists to spin their wheels on ad nauseum."
ALMA radio telescope released a Doppler image of Sagittarius A star in October of 2021.  The science daily website posted an article explaining how the Doppler image indicated gas and dust close to the black hole was not orbiting it.  The gas was moving directly away from it in every direction.  They've come to refer to it as a high velocity dispersion of matter in galaxies.  One astronomer proposed the black hole was a white hole in disguise because so much energy and matter was flowing rapidly away from it.
"No, black holes do not erase information from the universe.  They are the creators of information throughout the universe.

The black hole paradox arises when assuming that nothing can escape them.  Their theories and models of nature are wrong.  Supermassive black holes are the God like creators of all things.  They are massive, they are infinitely dense, produce the most gravity, the most energy, the most information.  The only reason why scientists came up with the information paradox was because if nothing is able to escape the gravity of a black hole then they would be considered eternal.  And only God is eternal.  So Hawking proposed maybe the gravity of the black hole was producing virtual particles just outside it's event horizon, allowing particles to escape, so black holes would not appear to be eternal, always existing.

Nothing can fall into a black hole and be destroyed.  Why would nature do that?

The answer to a theory of everything can only start with OVER-UNITY of energy.  It's the only explanation for nature and the universe, from the beginning right up to today."
"Youtube just deleted my comment. Before I could add a notation it was gone.  Kiss my A$$.  You just violated my 1st Amendment, unalienable right to speak freely as a human being!  You can't stop me.  I have an attorney and will sue you for billions!  I will own YouTube.  I save everything I write.  You're busted!"
"all the information that fell in, what about all the mass or energegy ( given that e=mc2) does the hawking radiation emit enough nutrionos and whatever not to add up to the two stars it just swallowed or is that not important da f$  . why is information conserved I thought some thermodynamyte said that energy cannot be created or destroyed therefore mass"
"OK, am I missing hawking radiation have been observed? Because Stephen Hawking himself said he will get the Nobel prize if it was ever observed. He didn’t, so I’m wondering why everyone is so very certain that it exists? Yes, the math sure seems to check out. But without direct observations, like the for a black hole itself, can you say it truly exists???"
"Feel like the black holes are basically recycle centers of the universe, and on the other side is a theoretical ""white hole"" that's creating constant other universes ""big bang"" moments. Idk something like that 😂"

"I dated a black hole once, you wouldn't believe how attractive she was."
"As usual for Brian Cox, too much prose, too little substance."
"Black holes are devoid bubbles of thermaldynamics as absolute cold resistance of space itself. Two forces clockwise and counterclockwise. Resistance and motion. Cold resistance of space itself and thermaldynamics. All mass decays as heat. Therefore, all masses are degrees of cold and accumulation of thermaldynamics in resistance. We live in past events. Interactions are infinite motion and points of space not to be repeated exactly the same. Alpha and Omega. Magnetic fields show repulsion to forward propulsion and repulsion to propulsion. Space of forward maximum momentum velocity in resistance to thermaldynamics pressure is equalization to pressure redirected trajectories into cycling circulation patterns of mass. Hydrogen under extreme pressure expands into helium. Density can't exceed resistance within it as cold resistance of space in occupational space. Mass occupies space as neutralized resistance within it. Proximity mass is repelled towards mass of least resistance. Conservation of maximum momentum velocity in resistance. Stars lose heat waves. Light is only present in resistance to mass. It is repelled as light and absorbed as heat. Physics works."
"I've Read Your Book, Black Holes: The Key To Understanding The Universe, It's Very impressive. Professor Cox."
Fascinating video explained mysteries smoothly
"Black holes, like vinyl records of the universe, hold encoded information waiting to be retrieved. This is how it appears to work.
In the context of the Quantum Information Hypothesis (QIH) theory. let's imagine a black hole as a massive vinyl record and delve deeper into how the holographic screen is akin to the speakers on a record player. The holographic screen represents the mysterious boundary of the black hole, and just like the speakers on a record player produce sound, the holographic screen contains encoded information about the black hole's properties. Here's how it works:

    Holographic Screen as Speakers: In the analogy, we consider the holographic screen surrounding the black hole to be analogous to the speakers on a record player. When we play a vinyl record, the sound is produced by the vibrations of the record's grooves. Similarly, the holographic screen stores information encoded on the black hole's boundary (the photon sphere) in the form of probability wave functions. This stored information can be thought of as ""sound"" in the context of the analogy.
    Information Retrieval through hf=mc^2 - The Lock and Key: In the QIH framework, the famous equation E=mc^2 takes on a new meaning. The energy (E) of the Hawking radiation photons is proportional to their frequency (f), and this energy can be related to the information encoded on the holographic screen. Much like a lock and key mechanism, the photons' frequencies (the key) act as a tool to unlock the encoded information (the lock) on the holographic screen. In this way, the equation hf=mc^2 plays a crucial role in retrieving the encoded information from the photon sphere.
    Interaction and Decoding: As Hawking radiation interacts with the bumpy surface of the photon sphere, it ""reads"" the encoded information stored on the holographic screen. The radiation acts like a ""needle"" on the record player, picking up the subtle details and patterns imprinted in the grooves of the photon sphere. The information read from the holographic screen contains probabilities of finding particles with specific properties, such as velocity, acceleration, and other characteristics.
    Inferring Probability of 0 and 1, Velocity, and Acceleration: The interaction between Hawking radiation and the photon sphere allows scientists to infer the probabilities of finding particles with different properties. These probabilities are akin to the ""0s"" and ""1s"" in quantum information theory, representing the likelihood of a particular particle having a specific property. Additionally, the information gathered from the holographic screen provides insights into the velocity, acceleration, and other characteristics of the particles that have fallen into the black hole.
    Understanding the Black Hole's Contents and Gravity: By studying the information read from the holographic screen, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of what lies within the black hole. The holographic screen serves as a repository of data about the particles that have entered the black hole, effectively ""playing back"" the history and properties of these particles. Moreover, the information gathered through hf=mc^2 and the interaction with the holographic screen contributes to our understanding of gravity and how it manifests within the black hole.

In summary, the holographic screen, like the speakers on a record player, acts as a ""speaker"" of the encoded information from the black hole's boundary. The application of hf=mc^2, akin to a lock and key mechanism, allows scientists to retrieve information from the photon sphere, which gives insights into probabilities, velocity, acceleration, and gravity within the black hole. Through this innovative approach, researchers are uncovering profound connections between quantum mechanics, gravity, and information theory, paving the way for deeper insights into the nature of black holes and the universe itself."
"11:15 thought he was going to say ""GOD.""

The origin of space time that can absorb all things in oneness and could remanifest every piece in a new ""heavens and earth"". 

How long until we finally recognize the synthesize theology and science?"
Any books anyone recommends to pick up?
Sorry but I can't. I just can't watch another video explaining black holes. I watch them then I think that I understand the material. But when I try to talk about it or explain it to someone else it becomes quite clear that I never really understood what they are and the implications. So at the risk of exposing myself as an intellectual dullard I'm just going to step away and watch something else. Sorry. I'm really sorry.
I have got a huge crush on him today and you uploaded this video today. Thanks 😺
"This is the solution they're looking for. If only they would read the comments ;) E=hf=ℏω=mc^2 is the universe (and us) in it's most simple, elegant and beautiful form. This equation shows the equivalence of light (hf), information or gravitational waves (ℏω) and gravity (mc^2). 
They are equivalent (just different relative perspectives). 
Deteailed Version:
In the Lightscape of Quantum Information Holography (QIH), we embark on a mathematical sojourn, where the symphony of equations resonates in the unison of quantum mechanics, information, and gravity. The relation hf=ℏω=mc^2 stands as the cornerstone in this theoretical construct, harmonizing these seemingly distinct domains into an integrated framework.
Wormhole Oscillations and Hawking Radiation:
Consider a pair of entangled black holes connected by a wormhole. The Hawking radiation emitted from the boundary of these black holes is imprinted on a qubit, transferring quantum information through the oscillatory behavior of the wormhole.
Equation 1: Oscillatory Behavior of Wormholes
ΔΨimprint​=∫t0​t1​​(2e^iωwormhole​t)⋅ΔΨHawking​(t)dt
In this equation:
    ΔΨimprint​ represents the imprinted quantum state vector due to the wormhole's oscillations.
    ωwormhole​ signifies the angular frequency associated with the oscillations of the wormhole.
    ΔΨHawking​(t) represents the quantum state vector of the Hawking radiation emitted at a specific time t.
This equation encapsulates the dynamic interaction of wormhole oscillations and Hawking radiation, contributing to the quantum imprint on the holographic screen.
Quantum State Vector and Light Needles:
The imprinted quantum state vector acts as a light needle, encoding information through its angular disposition, θ.
Equation 2: Angular Disposition
cos(θ)=∣ΔΨimprint​∣/(ΔΨimprint​⋅q^​​)
Where:
    q^​ represents the reference quantum state (qubit axis).
This equation elucidates the probability encoding mechanism, where the cosine of the angle between the quantum state vector and the qubit axis determines the probabilistic outcomes.
Encoding Acceleration and Gravity:
The rate of change of the angle, θ, encapsulates the acceleration, which is synonymous with gravity in General Relativity.
Equation 3: Encoding Gravity
a=d^2θ/dt^2
Where:
    a is the encoded acceleration (gravity).
By capturing the acceleration in the quantum framework through the rate of change of θ, this equation bridges the realms of quantum mechanics and gravity.
Conclusion:
In the QIH framework, the elegant interplay of equations unveils the intricate tapestry of the universe, where quantum mechanics, information, and gravity waltz in a harmonious ballet. The triumvirate relation, hf=ℏω=mc2, reigns supreme, echoing the unity of these diverse realms, painting a comprehensive portrait of the cosmos through the mathematical brush strokes of QIH."
The clash is the meeting of the mind and spirit. The male and female are all opposites. The Blackhole is a simple womb.
Thank you for this video it was really interesting
"technically black holes could be 'hyperholes' where the dimensions break down into unity - like a hypersphere or hypercube, meaning, they'd be nothing but a 'flat disk' from any dimensional angle, as well as a sphere. I also think 'octave black holes' are possible - a universe with black holes in a black hole in a universe of black holes in a black hole.. Which given my first theory implies the 'hyper universe' which would be definitively 'disk flat' and spherical, as the perimeter of any black hole. I also believe it's possible this could explain lending errors in astrophysics, local big bangs, which though a thing, could also be 'inert' and not 'catastrophic' as science implies, and explain local, universal expansion - and also contraction - dependent on the black holes environment the local universe is in."
"Information is conserved through Hawking radiation emitted back out as angular frequency or h-bar(w).  h-bar times angular frequency is energy in terms of information. That Hawking radiation is emitted onto a qubit as a Quantum State vector. That QSV encodes probability of spin up or down, velocity and acceleration. And acceleration is equivalent to…. Gravity!"
"One thing i find interesting is that before we observed black holes, equations showed such things exist. The same way Einstein equations showed that the universe is expanding before they observed it.

So what about worm holes, although they may possibly not be naturally occurring, but the equations show they are possible. I see them as the key to allow us to be able to travel the universe, because even travelling at the speed of light is way too slow due to the size of the universe."
"What a Proton is, and how it is a holographic projection from a black hole through Quantum Information holography which conforms with AdSCFT correspondence.. In normal and detailed terms.
Normal terms:
In the expansive canvas of the universe, a mystical dance of light particles, called photons, unfolds. Each photon, though separated by vast distances from its partners, is bound by an unseen force. This force, a tether of light (a wormhole), stretches and flexes, but never breaks, ensuring that the fates of these particles remain intertwined. This is the magic of ""entanglement.""
Imagine two ballet dancers on a grand stage. Though they might be far apart, a rubber band of light (a wormhole) connects them. When one leaps, the other responds instantly, as if the light band tugged at her. No matter their distance, their dance remains in perfect harmony, echoing the enigmatic dance of entangled photons.
There's a lighthouse (the singularity where light constructively converges onto one single qubit), mighty and proud, casting its beams into the vast abyss (the interference pattern of the superposition of all possible states at the singularity which is one planck qubit). Yet, this is no ordinary light. It paints upon the cosmic canvas of ""spacetime."" Each radiant stroke leaves a shadow, an echo, on this universal fabric. This intricate play of light and shadow is at the heart of Quantum Information Holography (QIH).
Enter Hydrogen, our universe's protagonist. Simple in structure, with just a proton and an electron, it moves in a delicate waltz. The proton, our star performer, carries within it smaller dancers named quarks and gluons. Their rhythm, their synchrony, isn't accidental. The cosmic rubber band of entanglement dictates their steps, ensuring perfect harmony.
But how do we witness this celestial ballet? Picture a grand theater. Every performance, each twirl and spin, is projected onto the majestic drapes that encircle the stage. These curtains, vast and ethereal, hold the secrets of the cosmos. Through QIH's lens, this boundary is a keeper of tales, echoing every dance move, every whisper of an electron, every sigh of a quark.
Journeying beyond Hydrogen, we encounter a diverse ensemble – helium, carbon, oxygen, and more. Each element, with its unique set of dancers and choreographies, reveals deeper layers of entanglement. Their graceful complexity, their very essence, is a testament to the universe's interconnected web of light and energy.
In the end, the universe's story, as woven by QIH, isn't merely about particles in motion. It's a poetic saga of bonds unbroken, of light particles in ceaseless harmony, and of a grand theater that remembers and echoes every dance. Through this lens, every atom, every element, becomes a chapter in the eternal dance of entanglement, unfolding on the holographic stage of reality.
Detailed terms:
Consider the quantum state of two entangled photons:
∣Ψ⟩=12(∣0⟩A∣1⟩B−∣1⟩A∣0⟩B)∣Ψ⟩=2
​1​(∣0⟩A​∣1⟩B​−∣1⟩A​∣0⟩B​)
Here, the photons, denoted as A and B, are in a superposition such that if photon A is measured in state ∣0⟩, photon B will instantly be in state ∣1⟩, and vice versa, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This represents the ballet dancers' entangled dance.
In the realm of QIH, the spacetime fabric can be modeled using the AdS/CFT correspondence. This posits that a gravitational theory in an ""AdS"" space (Anti-de Sitter space) is equivalent to a boundary quantum field theory in a ""CFT"" space (Conformal Field Theory). 
Mathematically:
ZAdS​[g]=⟨e−SCFT​[Φ]⟩
Where ZAdS​ is the partition function in the bulk, and SCFT​ represents the action in the boundary theory.
Now, considering the hydrogen atom within QIH, the proton and electron's bound state can be viewed in terms of entangled quantum states. The proton, comprising quarks q and gluons g, is described by:
∣p⟩=∫d3kψ(k)∣3q,g,k⟩
The wave function ψ(k) captures the behavior of quarks and gluons within the proton, with k being the momentum space representation.
The binding of the electron e to the proton can be described by the hydrogen wave function:
∣H⟩=∫d3xχ(x)∣e,p,x⟩
Where χ(x) represents the spatial distribution of the electron relative to the proton.
Moving up the periodic table, the increased mass and complexity of elements can be seen as a result of more intricate quantum entanglement structures:
MElement​=∑i​Ei​+EBinding​
Here, Ei​ represents the energy of each particle (proton/neutron), and EBinding​ is the energy binding them together.
In essence, QIH provides a holographic perspective on the quantum world. The ""boundary"" in QIH isn't just a mathematical construct but represents the universe's informational edge. Every quantum state in our 3D world is mirrored by a state on this 2D boundary, painting a holographic picture of our reality. The dance of particles, from photons to quarks, is both a local and a boundary phenomenon, interconnected by the rich tapestry of entanglement and spacetime geometry.
 Proton as Entangled Light Bits:
    At the heart of QIH is the idea that the fundamental entities in the universe, like protons, are not just ""particles"" but manifestations of quantum information. Within the proton, quarks and gluons interact and are bound together, possibly through some form of entanglement.
∣Proton⟩=∫d3pϕ(p)∣3q,p⟩
    Interference Pattern and the Boundary:
    This brings us to the AdS/CFT correspondence principle, where the dynamics in the bulk (like the interactions within the proton) can be fully described by data on a boundary. Imagine this boundary as a 'holographic screen' which captures the quantum states of entities within the bulk, such as our proton.

    Hawking Radiation and Quantum Decoherence:
    Hawking radiation, as theorized, results from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon of black holes. If we extend this to the idea of ER=EPR (where Einstein-Rosen bridges, or wormholes, are equivalent to EPR pairs, or entangled particle pairs), the ""snipping"" of these wormholes could result in a particle taking on a definite state due to decoherence.
    ∣Entangled State⟩→∣Decohered State1​⟩+∣Decohered State2​⟩
    Mirroring and Opposite Universe:
    If the universe is indeed holographic, and every particle's state can be described on a boundary, then this boundary information can theoretically represent a mirror of our universe's properties. The notion of an ""opposite"" universe emerging from the decoherence process, with opposing quantum states, is a more speculative idea but can be entertained within the QIH framework.

Nice explanation
"The particle pair illustration of Hawking radiation is deceptive. Why would only antimatter fall in, and only matter escape? The radiation is ultra-long-wavelength light, not particles. And why the obsession with proving that information is conserved? That is nothing but an aesthetic preference."
If Alexander Albon had become a physicist
"Wait, so how did Laplace know that light had a definite speed, 200 years before Einstein?"
Last time I was this early my girlfriend gave me dirty looks for a week.

Is Einstein wrong and everyone is just afraid to admit it?

🙏 thanks for your invaluable time and effort!
"I've always found Black Holes fascinating, but I've never connected them with that line, ""End of Time.""  It's very poetic."
