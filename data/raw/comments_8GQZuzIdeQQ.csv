Im watching this right now weather i quit my 9 to 5 job or persue my passion as a full time artist. Im stock in analysis paralysis right now and what are the consequences if i quit. I dont have much time left since i need to give 1 month notice for my decision. But i know god is leading me into something good. I decided the hard way
"1. Use your negetiv emotions to achieve your goals.
2. You must have control over your life.
3. Stop focus on big goals instead  of progress.
4. Don't consume content instead start taking actions.
5. Think Big , achive big - You should set realistic goals 
6. Take small steps to achieve Big goals.

"I just want to say, that, as a millennial, the question ""Do I donate my life savings to charity?"" is maybe the least relatable question I've ever heard in my entire life."
"I've always been a drifter all my life, no more."
"Sadly, I feel Dr. Chang lacked compassion for her younger self. Choosing to become a lawyer reflected her value for security at the time, and it didn't mean she was a drifter. Her change in circumstances may have altered her perspective, but it doesn't invalidate her past choices, which were also made with autonomy. Perhaps her success as a philosopher made it harder for her to empathise with her younger, more vulnerable self.
It's important to remember that not everyone has the same privilege to follow their dreams."
"""when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that. we wholeheartedly become the people that we are"" But what are the bases for creating reasons to become a banker rather than to become an artist, say? Don't I need to know myself, know my values? If there is a better or worse or equally good answer to this question about who I am or what my values are, then isn't it not a hard choice anymore? (And if this is a wrong question to ask since there is no ""self"" and we can create ourselves ex nihilo, then there is nothing wrong with being a drifter.) Perhaps what defines hard choices is not that the options are on a par, but that the yardstick to compare the options is unclear - the person does not know herself or her values (well enough)."
"Your effort and dedication can make any decision work out. I tell myself that there is no wrong decision‚ÄîI have the power to make it the right one. I can create a successful and happy path, no matter which choice I make."
"You don't ""create"" reasons, sorry Post Modernism. Reasons exist and you choose which to focus on and follow. I choose not to get diabetes from my breakfast vs to feel good in the moment. You can measure those results scientifically with health and longevity markers like nutrition content & their functions in the body vs dopamine markers or inflammation. Those reasons are both based on objective reality, that exists (thanks, Enlightenment! <3) But my subjectivity and free will is in how I craft and navigate my life and responses, in relation to reality and my own sense of self, values, dreams, etc. Pretending that we ""create"" rather than recognize the reasons ourselves is not only delusional but quite narcissistic. Living from a place of delusion is a kind of slavery as well, especially because it creates all sorts of unnecessary discord and confusion as regards our wellbeing and society."

The advice to follow your passion is stupid.
It‚Äôs not ¬´¬†what‚Äôs the best choice for me ?¬†¬ª we should ask to ourselves but ¬´¬†what I will become with this choice ?¬†¬ª
Como consigo acha em portugu√™s?
"My best interpretation of the talk:

You have to decide what values are more important for you, what you are going to value. You create value in the process of making such choices. Think of a baby/kid that makes certain choices about hobbies, food. He/she creates reasons in the process of making a choice. We will not tell our kid that he/she should do the hobby/study that best fits his/her values, we will motivate him/her to make a choice and see that choice as a step in becoming a person. Same for adults. So it's not so much about discovering reasons/which are the best reasons but rather creating reasons. in making a choice, you rather create reasons (or value) than passively discover and follow existing reasons (related to values). When reason tells you that both options are equally valuable, accept that both options are fine, use your intuition or feeling to decide which is really ok (or flip a coin if you want, whatever you want), and stop thinking about discovering reasons but focus on valuing/being attached to your choice.

does this make sense?"
Great perspective!  I really appreciated this.  I totally agree that hard choices forge our agency and individuality.  This is what philosophy is about üëäüèª
I thought this was brilliant. The premise as I took it is that decisions should be based on personal values and be more about the kind of person you want to become vs. an optimal solution. The problem I still have is what if you have to juxoppose two mutually exclusive values when you want to embody both. That is difficult but then again this is where she is talking about having to define yourself one way or the other.
"Wow, thanks, I'm still indecisive but smarter üòÇ"

"Hard-choice is still just a choice. It's only hard to choose if we don't know the end goal, who we are, or where we are supposed to be. 

But if you already know, it'll be easy, cause if it's still going there anyway any option is fine.
Maybe pick the one that's faster, or slower, closer or further, depending on our own taste which comes from how we define ourselves. 

You might like it slow and enjoy the process or fast and just get to the end point.
It's all up to you and your definition.

Just don't forget to celebrate options, choices and variety. They are simply an existence of an opportunity to define who we are."

"It's not that there is no best choice among multiple options; it‚Äôs that we are incapable of ever knowing which choice it is. 

Perhaps God does.

The stumbling block for us is our belief that we can ever know which was which. All that we can know is whether our choice worked out well for us or not. But we can never know it was the better or worse choice.

Like in the parable of the Chinese farmer and his son. Wherein every day something happens to the farmer and his son and every day his neighbors come and pronounce judgment on the event. ""Too Bad,‚Äù they say one day about one event. Then,  ‚ÄúHow lucky you are,"" the next day about a different event. After each pronouncement the farmer ambivalently replies, ‚ÄúWe'll see."" With each new day revealing the neighbors' judgments, no matter what they were, were wrong."
Who to merry? that's everyday a big one for me ;)
"‚Äì it‚Äôs a mistake to think that in hard choices one alternative is better than the other 
‚Äì we tend to assume that scientific thinking holds the key to everything of importance in our world, but the world of VALUE is different from the world of SCIENCE. So there is no reason to believe that in choice there are only three possibilities: one is better, worse or equal to the other.
‚Äì hard choices -> alternatives are ‚Äòon a par‚Äô, in the same league of value, that‚Äôs why the choice is hard
‚Äì each of us has the power to create reason
‚Äì in a world where there is a ‚Äòbest‚Äô option, we‚Äôre slaves to reasons
‚Äì when we create reasons for ourselves rather than reasons given to us we wholeheartedly become the people we are
‚Äì instead of looking for reasons out there we should look for reasons within. Who am I to be? 
‚Äì looking at it this way hard choices are not a curse but a godsend"

Probably one of the best/most influential Ted talks I have ever listened to.
Thank you for giving me the answer of what I already knew I should persue!
"THESE are the DEFINING MOMENTS in our Lives!

Instinctively, we know it, but it's the fear from the evil one that  holds us back in these most important, rarest, most momentous instances in our lives!

We either TAKE A LEAP OF FAITH for WHAT WE BELIEVE IN, which is UNDERPINNED by our Hod-Hiven Talents we are REQUIRED BY HIM TO MULTIPLY, and ENTER INTO OUR DESTINY, awaiting us

RIGHT HERE & RIGHT NOW at THIS VERY CROSSROAD. . . .

or COP OUT, and live a LIFE OF MEDIOCRITY, 

where we are SURE TO BE  SECURE..... 

but NEVER  FULFILLED

For we have in this Very Moment CHOSEN to BURY OUR TALENTS

- AND DID!

+Q-S/"
This insight upends the conventional view of decision-making as a stressful task. Chang eloquently communicated that these choices are not just about selecting between options but also defining who we are as individuals. These decision-making moments are indeed opportunities to manifest our values. It's a beautiful sentiment and a mindset I'll carry into future decisions.
"This was really helpful. I've been battling between a really tough choice for the past two months, and pros/cons and over analysis have not helped. This has."
"Creo que la decisi√≥n m√°s dif√≠cil para la mayor√≠a es dejar de hacer estupideces, siempre eligen hacer estupideces ""s√≥lo una vez m√°s"""
"Oh my god this video helped me so much, I cried, this is so what I needed. THANK YOU"
"All things being equal this talk makes a lot of sense. However what is not mentioned here is first you must survive and to do that you need income. We are faced with the obligation to do whatever work we can obtain to put food in our stomachs. While remembering that we do not live to put food in our stomachs we live to put nourishment into our souls. Do what you have to do but be focused on being who you are. Becoming who you are is what we live for. But we get caught up don't we. We start identifying with our menial work and we start believing that is all we are. Which is not so! Suppose I want to be a yacht builder but I have no skills to build. I must eat. So I take a job that I can do to get food and I use the rest of my time working on becoming a yacht builder. This is the way. But maybe not... Perhaps I should become a yacht builder today and hope that the journey will bear fruit along the way, enough to keep me supported. At the core of this, use these things to sharpen your mind."
"Very powerful and life changing advice that I am going to stick to (or rather have already stuck to but never knew the right words for it) -  ‚ÄúReflect on what you can put your agency behind, in what you can be for, and through Hard choices, become that person‚Äù.

Wow such a God sent ! This is the best speech on this topic I have ever heard this helped me to really decide and process hard decision I have been battling . Thank You !
it's 2023 and still no Netflix DvD with our lives in each choice
"I loved the fact she mentioned how we have started evaluating life decisions according to scientific thinking. That's a real eye-opener. Decisions of life are not like length or mass that are measurable as less, more or equal. We may equate it with money but still the choices are still abstract, that's why they're hard. Simply put, hard choices are meant for you to choose what kind of life you want to ""create"""
She is a grwat philosopher
i love it
"Interesting approach. I can't agree, however. I feel like the message is to just make up whatever you want in order to justify a hard choice. This might be okay for a choice that affects only you, but do we want to empower our leaders to operate this way. I don't. Choices that are hard are not incomparable.  They are hard because there are either competing objectives at play, uncertainty in the consequences or outcomes of each possible alternative, or a struggle between the trade-offs that would result from the choice. You can compare them using multiple objective analyses which are designed to address this very difficulty of bringing competing values into the decision. While there may not be a ""best"" choice in a traditional sense, there most certainly is an ""optimal"" choice if you work hard at defining all of the different fundamental objectives underlying the decision as step 1 (even and especially those objectives that compete with one another) rather than just calling the decision hard and leaving it at that.  Being an artist might be better on life fulfillment and worse on financial stability, but how we value life fulfillment in comparison to financial stability and our risk tolerance come into play to help show that one choice really is optimal over another, depending on how these values are held by the decision-maker."
"""Far from being sources of agony and dread, hard choices are precious opportunities for us to celebrate what is special about the human condition, that the reasons that govern our choices as correct or incorrect sometimes run out. And it is in the space of hard choices that we create reasons for ourselves to become the people that we are. And that's why hard choices are not a curse, but a godsend."""
The best 15 minutes I spent this week.
Yeah Coin Flip will do
"I can cope with most of the hard choices, except being married or not married. I love someone and I spent a lot of years with her. She wants to get married now, but sometimes I think that she is not the right person, and sometimes I think that she is the best person for getting married. Also, both of our time is very limited for that decision due to some career reasons. I fear that my decisions will become my mistakes one day in the future in retrospect. Also, I think about her life with big mercy. Like, what will she do after me, could she get married(because of some old memories)? On the other hand, I sometimes feel bad about her personal attitude as she fights a lot and makes things big. Therefore, I think getting married to her can be a disaster. 

It is the hardest choice in my life...  How can I overcome this?"
Mr. Nobody
"Finally, I can make hard choices easily. This video is gem."
I love that she applies math to decision making üòä
Might be like the 10th time I find myself watching this.
"Love the talk, years later for a re-watch. I agree, either unknowingly or instinctively I made choices that aligned with my values. I write down my values and review them to see if my path is still true. ¬†Extrinsic vs intrinsic rewards can cloud the way but I realized I am most content when I choose which best aligns with my values.   
Years ago, with math and economics degree I had the opportunity to work on Wall Street, but I chose computer technology b/c that was my hobby as a kid. So, I chose to work at cancer hospital in technology. While I realized either choice would not necessarily be a wrong one I found my choice to be aligned best with who I am. I wish everyone much love and to enjoy your short visit in this life."
This is fantastic lesson! Also what a pleasant surprise to see Esther Perel sitting among the audience and totally enjoying this talk!
I want this to help but I am still so stuck. I'll watch again and hope.
"This is really interesting, wish I found it sooner."
I can't belive I've waited this long to figure out what questions to ask. You answered it. Thank you. God bless you
this is so accurate i mean she was right about using science in making decisions by draw a line between 2 of them and choose one because it gives better option or it's more safe to do that way isn't the best way  to make good decision it is just depend  on us who we are giving out the best reasons to choose it
This has been very helpful. Thank you.
10:30 best part starts
"I come here and watch this video every time I am faced with a decision that could affect the course of my life. And each time I remind myself to be true to myself and the person that I am (or that I choose to be). I firmly believe that the way we choose to approach what we live really does make a difference. I am eternally grateful to have seen this video by chance all those years ago and to be able to see it again today. 

I would like to wish the best of luck to all those who find themselves in the position of having to make a ""difficult choice"". I hope you always have the strength and courage to choose what is true for yourself."

"What if you choose based on who you feel you are/ want to become, and it still doesn't work out, based on factors you couldn't foresee: an example, a few years ago I adopted a ten year old rescue dog, it was taking a leap of faith because I have 5 beloved cats at home (but love dogs and used to have them until they died of old age) -- I brought the rescue dog home and it became clear, despite going about the introductions in as slow a way as I had read was necessary/ separating them but allowing them to see one another etc., the dog would have killed my cats (despite being told at the shelter he was good with cats). I contacted a trainer to see what was possible and she said it was unsafe since the dog was older, this cat reactivity was unlikely to change and even if it could it would be a long stressful time for the cats and the dog, and I should bring the dog back to the shelter. This was something unimaginable but what I ended up having to do for the safety of my cats and also so the dog could have a chance at a loving, cat free home. Now, if I want to try to adopt a dog again, and choose based on who I am/ want to become, which is an animal lover who wants to say ""yes"" to animals who need a home as long as I can keep up with all their needs, I have this past experience that tells me, you can choose based on your own becoming but it doesn't necessarily mean it will feel like the better choice once the unforeseens become visible. Yes, any experience is growthful, but I guess I wish the speaker could have spoken a bit to this kind of thing, the unforeseens...."

"Ruth Chang says that hard choices are hard because none of the alternatives is way better than the other. Therefore, even small choices can be hard. Whether to have chocolate ice cream or creme brulee can be a very hard choice indeed, if I like them both and if I am craving for sweets at that moment.  So what do we do? We take the safest option.

We decide to become engineers than artists because statistically, the probability of getting a job as an engineer is higher than that of an artist. So, we take the safest option, because we fear that we are too stupid to understand the better option if the choice to make is hard. We prefer not to take any risks and we go for the option that is rationally comforting.

This is the very mistake we make. Remember, in hard choices no option is better than the other. We simply do not know‚Ä¶How can we know that engineering makes us happier in our future lives? Unfortunately, there are no fast forward and rewind buttons for life. So, does it really make sense to conclude that engineering is the better option? It's not and whether we like it or not at the end of the day hard choice is the only way to make our life easier. How ironic."
"Ruth Chang says that there is something we have misunderstood about hard choices. These are not a source of agony, a reason for sorrowful days or sleepless nights. Instead, these are chances for us to personally grow as human beings. ‚ÄúUnderstanding hard choices helps us uncover a hidden power that each one of us possesses.‚Äù"
"Don't try to make the right decision, make the decision right."
How to make hard choices? Shouldn't we be asking men this question? ü§£ üòß
This was really a very inspiring talk and I‚Äòm truly amazed by it. And I believe that in the future I will be able to think that way about hard choices. Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt make the one I‚Äòm struggling with right now. The safe option is not a 100% what I really want but it would be the most logical one. On the other hand the option that I fear in some ways would mean giving up everything and I think this one could be the one I could regret. So I can either choose something I know I won‚Äôt be really happy about or I can choose the one that I might regret
"Brilliant üëè üëè 
Ask yourself  a simple  question: Is the choice  you are about  to make will expand you and you will  grow?

What If you  eventually  understand  that   the choice  you are about  to make has already been  done by you in another  parallel  reality ? Actually  you finally  got it you just imagine  you have  a choice.  Well  you don't.

Have  a  lovely  day to all of us"
Thank you for this video
I dont think she really answer the questions
I hate how most of the ted talks are like 98% defining the question or problem and the rest 2% is about the answer that i never get to comprehend ughh
This was explained really well !

I really wish that I had watched this video when it was first uploaded in 2014, it would certainly have helped me to have more confidence when facing hard choices. This is something I learned through my own life experience that when faced with hard choices there will be pros and cons no matter which way you turn."

thank you
Muito bom
Very Interesting! Thank you!
"""The power to create reason....""  think about that again...   Thank you Ruth Thank you TED"
Also hard choices are hard because you have to change your life totally (or most of it) and for a long run. Otherwise if the choice is really for breakfast or a project that goes for 6 months for example and doesn't require a lot most probably I would easily decide. But this video definitely gave me a new insight and that you mam for that.
"Actually I have a good one with flipping coin:
So flipping a coin for two alternatives will give you the understanding which one you want more during that time when the coin is still in the air."

"Drifter here!  Thank you for this amazing talk, Ruth. I found this from a Google search, and admittedly, I was bored at first with the talk about alternatives and the > = < stuff.  I thought this was just going to confuse me more.  But no.  When you got to the ""par in value"" not being comparable to the qualitative measures, WOW, I got it.  I've spent so many years drifting around from career to career, idea to idea, and job to job. 
I see now that this comes down to values and who you want to become.  How do you want to form yourself over your lifetime to go along with your values and what really matters to you?  Screw the formula.  I have a decision to make currently, and am going to throw out the pros and cons and switch my mindset. I wish I knew this stuff when I was young!"

Making a choice? Ive chronic pain and vertigo. I wanted to adopt a cat yeah she had similar. The following is upsetting content. If it doesn't feel right ask why. I adopted a cat and got my heart broken. Never again. I was anxious as I thought the cat seemed off she died of one of the worst conditions out there. Even choosing to euthanize was the wrong choice. After the second cat died of very similar issues  I decided never to adopt again. I still have horrendous symtoms and I was quite disgusted I fxxd up twice and very very sorry

"When faced with a hard choices don't make decisions based on reasons given to you by others, rather you need to create the reasons for the choices yourself. What kind of person do you want to be a few years down the line and which choice do you have to make to become that person. Which choice best goes with your values and beliefs. There are no right or wrong choices there's just choices, give it some thought and pick one and work and do your best to make it the right choice."
She needs to talk to Chidi Anagonye

"Great talk, glad I CHOSE to look up a self help video for my situation instead of something that would entertain me. The way you explained it was very precise and hit the mark as best as the mark could be hit without making us slaves to outside choices."

Casual Esther Perel at 12:21
Excellent
"One of the best TEDTalks. I am glad you became a philosopher! Otherwise, this video wouldn't exist."
Neither is better but they're not equal? That's not possible
"Excellent. I wish she gave more lectures. Reminds me of Viktor Frankl's lectures about finding meaning in ones life to make it fulfilling. Without ""meaning"" people drift all over and are usually unhappy."
"I come to this video at 3AM in the middle of the night trying to decide if I should switch my job of equal pay, equal role, just a different department. It is a hard choice because they are similar jobs. The current job offers stability and easy pass since I already know how to do my job. The new job offers new learning opportunities and along with it a lot of hard work to gain those knowledge. 

My reasoning is the salary is the same, so why should I change and have to risk the uncertain challenges from the new job? Well, there is obviously something I don‚Äôt like about the current job, otherwise, it wouldn‚Äôt be a hard choice.  It is an internal battle. 

But I think this video gave me an answer. I want to learn new things but I fear change and risk. Don‚Äôt let fear and risk to stop you from what you want to be."
I love how they casually show Esther Perel sitting in the crowd :D
Sorry...but she didnt gave me any answears..
Essentially you're creating a false dichotomy for yourself.
She conflates choices and decisions.
"Are we really deciding our own preferences?  When we make a choice to eat noodles instead of bread, we are just using our inner desire to make a decision, and it's actually calculated in some way. Further, how do we got these preferences in the first place?  It doesn't seem to be from ourselves."

Verdadeiro e emocionante!
"Summary: Hard choices are those where neither alternative is better overall, hence difficult to choose between. A choice may be hard but at the same time unimportant, like choosing food from menu. Also, for important hard choices, the outcome is often unknown, which makes them harder.

Don't have naive scientific attitude and try to put choices on a linear scale of good and bad. Complex numbers and entanglement are just few examples of incomparable or unquantifiable things in science. Just imagine how hard life must be.

The thing is- there is no rationally good or bad alternative in hard choices. If everything could be rationalized, then we would be reduced to automaton. In other words, instead of being episodes of agony, hard choices are opportunity for us to express our consciousness, and be the person we are."

"Glad I watched this! But, the ability to not be pressured by societal norms is often curtailed by our background/ situation and a lot harder to do in certain societies. Definitely hard to do in a not so wealthy, developing nation."
"This video for me missed out something fundamental idea that supports her discourse on how to make hard choices. Its quite deceiving to make a choice if you will not 'know more about the choices that you will be choosing'.
For me it is lack of the elements of ""Trying"".You will not know whats the best choice unless youll try those choices first. I also believe that we sometimes bound by pressure and nonsensical preach by others so a simple choice leads to a hard choice.
So, ""Trying"" is the best option/solution. Do not afraid to make hard choices because it will makes us more savvy for good reasons. Thats part of life. Deal with it. Give it a shot!"

Had to watch the second time to understand
"I listened to this twice and hear two message versions. One is about agency and creating the person we want to become.  A second is implicitly through her own story of lawyer vs philosopher.  She said that she chose law school because it was safe but ultimately it did not fit and was not what she loved. This suggests more a  psychology of personality and less room to maneuver.  It does not sound like she could have been happy with the lawyer choice, given her personality and value structure.  If she could not be satisfied with being a lawyer, then the choices are not of equal value for her.  She might make reasons for it, such as money and safety, but her heart and body would rebel."

"I am studying law too, but I don't want to be a lawyer but working alternatives are great. Today I decided to quit and follow my interests. wish me luck :)"
"I didn't really fully grasp this until watching the second time around. The first time I didn't find it very helpful. In reality it's quite profound. Let go of the pro-con list and the endless comparison and analysis of every feature. Let go of fear and of taking the safer, easier route. Decide who you want to be and what you want to live for, and then choose whatever will get you closer to that. And celebrate hard choices as opportunities to define yourself and your life."
"Thank you Ruth Chang! I like your philosophy, it's similar to Stephen Covey's 2nd and 3rd habit, your the programmer and write the program. Why let somebody write it for you. Colossal point!"
easily the best ted talk i've ever listened to
How do we decide what kind of people we want ourselves to be? That's another hard choice.
Yea.... She missed her calling as a lawyer. She is very good at explaining the unexplainable. I could listen to her talk for days üòç
"When it comes to lifetime decisions such us who to marry, career to choose and where to live, you have to trust your gut and feelings. You are not going to be happy if you're just rational all the time. Sometimes being right all boils down to what makes you happy."

Okay so how can i choose between betty and lolita?
"One of my fav tedtalks, will forever carry it with me."
>=< face lol
"hmmm.. This helped me, but only because I thought about it through for a while. 


The core of what she was saying is good, but I feel like it was kind of diluted with things that actually detracted from the point. Someone in the comments said, ""Just make a choice, then make so that it turns out to be a good one"". I understand why they came to this conclusion based on this video. I think that people like this would have clearer understandings had the video beed a lot more direct. I'm gonna break it down in my own words and it might help people.


For me, the important part is when she mentioned ""Drifters"". A drifter is someone who's aimless and subsequently doesn't no who they are. To understand who you are, it's important to be able to recognize meaning. (Look up ""Jordan Peterson Meaning"") Defining yourself, your goals, your principles, allows you to recognize the choices that yield the most meaning from the consequences of your decisions.


That's it. I don't think this adds to what she said, it might make her point clearer though. idk. Also, keep in mind that Jordan Peterson is politically controversial, but has a great life philosophy and I'd encourage anyone to look him up as he's very important to this. I like a lot of what she had to say, ""If your life were nothing but easy choices, you'd be a slave to your decisions.""

"....And yet, when it comes to making a hard choice, my options are a subset of socially constrained options. So long as feel that I exercised my will in choosing from a limited set of viable options can I claim I am expressing the authentic me. The individual who allows life to guide their choices is a drifter, they make decisions passively and therefore allow themselves to be swept up by the flow of life. The principle of Wu Wei would apply here. However, those who from their inner self make a choice are more resilient to being pushed around by the flow of life, they resist certain ideas and support others. In this sense their lives are meaningful because they engaged their agency in support some cause or idea.  They dictate to the world who they are and make life into what they want by self-created reasons. 


Where those reasons originate from is unimportant..... At what point did I decide to decide? I can certainly get behind the idea of making decisions that 'feel right' because that feeling is how I 'know' I've acted in accordance with a deeper part of me.  I've expressed myself in a way that reflects my inner feelings. How I arrived at those feelings is an unknown mystery but that doesn't matter so long as I have allowed their expression to be released. It's as if the outside world flows through me and I through it and when I have a sense that I want to move or act I do and in that act I am being authentic to who I really am. Which is a creature that is interconnected with its environment. I am my ecology. So to act in a way the expresses my inner feelings is to allow the flow of life to pass through me unimpeded. The same way water flows down a mountain. 


I am not certain but pretty confident there is no right way to act. Which is to say there is also no wrong way to act. You just do, and there it is. We can layer on complex mental games but these are also simply manifestations of what there is.

"I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know what to do. This comment is probably too late to be seen but oh well, I want to air my thoughts. Do I study music at university, which has been my passion and hobby longer than I‚Äôve been able to read and write, or do law (ive been offered a fully paid scholarship). I love learning and academia, and think I would be able to do some really impactful changes as a lawyer, and I have a strong drive to make the world a better place. On the other hand, I love music and it makes me feel incredible and sometimes when I perform, euphoric. I could do music now, and law later, of course, but I would lose the scholarship. Taking the scholarship would significantly assist my parents financially. I can get behind being a musician, and exisiting to create beauty and share joy. I can also see myself making significant change and fighting for the greater good as a lawyer. Which is the person I want to be? I want to be both, but I also want to ensure financial security for my family. I want to be a good child, and create beauty, and change the world, but I feel like I can‚Äôt be all these things at once. I need to decide today and I‚Äôm at a complete loss. Thanks for reading!"
"Extraordinary, deeper explanation."
"here‚Äôs my situation,

my high school offers CTE (Career Technology Education) programs which are essentially really hard to get into programs that let you take college classes and get the experience in high school. 

I want to be a lawyer, so I applied for the criminal justice program. 

18/240 people get accepted and they look at everything from grades, to attendance and your application.

If I get accepted, I‚Äôd take 2 classes sophomore and junior year and 4 senior year. Essentially, I barely get any electives but I get to take this course.

My hard decision comes in here, I‚Äôm unable to take a lot of AP classes and I‚Äôm planning on applying to Ivy League colleges or just prestigious colleges in general and my GPA would suffer if I took the CTE course. I want a 5.00 GPA which is impossible to get taking CTE classes. Like, I‚Äôd have the tiniest bit over a 4.00 GPA and so now I‚Äôve spent hours upon hours on my application for the program. I‚Äôm getting my letter soon on whether I made it in or not and if I did, I‚Äôd have to choose between a good GPA or the program. 

I know no one cares but it helps me to write this out because I‚Äôm freaking out"

"Completely wrong.


Banking Job with even more money if ***FAR*** better than the Artist.


Work the bank - get financial security and then be an artist or philosopher and can be creative without financial concerns.


Thats what Ruth Chang did right ?

You should definitely have chosen philosophy because if money becomes the real question then you will always remain that immigrant. Instead you should right away choose to become the leader. Because guess what? As a lawyer your laws will change because philosophers will come to show you why they should.

The reason it‚Äôs so difficult is because online school is expensive, I get distracted easily, and I don‚Äôt learn properly unless I‚Äôm shown something. I don‚Äôt want to go back to school though, because the bully got into trouble and knows that I told on them. I‚Äôve been doing well at school, it‚Äôs just the bullying that isn‚Äôt working out for me. Everything else is fine.

"Having to make a ""hard choice"" is simple. That's because if you pay attention, you will see that the Universe (or ""God"") provides you with Guidance and very clear signs as to which path to take, i.e., you don't have to make choices at all; instead, simply follow the path presented, and do not worry - the Universe will not trick you or lead you astray."
"Oh, I really, really liked this.  Thank you.  Going to share with several friends.  Seems to me this way of looking at hard choices is true on the individual level and the societal level."

HOW DO I CHOOSE
That zoom on Esther Perel totally engrossed in the talk from 12:18- 12:22 <3
Mindblowing thks a lot...
who tf names their child Lolita
existence precedes essence
Measuring options in hard choices is like measuring the volume of a set amount of air. It changes based on temperature [mood] and pressure [pressure].
12:19 Esther Perel displaying great listening skills!
"Now all of this aside, I have two job offers at the moment to choose from; one is at a suburban firm which provides security and a low career with much less stress and proximity to home, the other a high end stressful job in the city with far better challenges, exposure and mentorship, which one should I go for? I'm very scared of failing at the city job and being back where I am now, i.e looking for jobs again and going through numerous job interviews."
Awesome awesome and yet more awesome!  Such a magnificent talk!
"Thank you . Honesty from the very bottom of my heart Thank you. I needed this actually, i always find myself cought up in between things and always fearing peoples Judgment after every decision. Choosing between things just tears me from within .But! Now i know that I've to choose the thing basing on who i wanna be or who I am truly.  üåªüïä"
I come back to this video every year on this day to celebrate I stopped smoking and drinking
"I couldn't have watched this video at a more apt time in my life. I'm totally lost trying to decide how to move ahead in life. This woman has extreme clarity and understanding of how a situation like I'm in, could be dealt with. Thank you!"
"The message I got was only hard choices force you to make meaningful decisions that have weight, which almost always results in the right path for you. You either make the right choice and it feels good, or you make the wrong choice, which allows you to learn a bit about what you don't actually want."
Unuseful video üëé
"I believe that one can't look at another's life and say that the decisions that they made are > = <  but they themselves can only do that. That doesn't mean that the concept of >=< is invalid it just mean it's invalid to everyone but you.
Now let's add someone that lived a perfect life and that knows and felt exactly what we have gone through then this concept no longer applies to just you it's you and that being. If you don't know what im referring to it's Christ.
I will add that > = < or as i like to call it white, gray, and black does not apply to everything in which we decide i our lives but only to some and that includes ones in which you didn't. But it is more white and grey than black that crops up in the decisions we make. Because killing, cheating, and stealing are all in the black but not all are equally bad but those decisions don't come up as often or non at all. Another thing, its meny small decision that led you to make such big life changing decision is never just one."
"When making hard choices:

Acknowledge they are hard because there is no best alternative. They are blessings; easy choices are passively detrimental.

To solve hard choices: Exercise your agency by looking within. Your stance, your voice, your values matter ultimately in tough decisions. Be proactive (owning up to choices), not reactive (a drifter succumbing to easy choices), and ensure to weigh hard choices by their potential to you rather than qualities of those choices."
Listen to your heart! The speech is this simple. Why so much over explanation?
"I always regard hard choices as chances,chances of getting to know yourself better.I first rejected my mon's will of me becoming a teacher,then I accepted it eventually.But there came the crossroad,give it up or I wouldn't be able to move forward.If it wasnt for the hard choices,I would not be able to realise I never wanted to stay in one place doing the same work everyday.I wrote down every detail of the person I wanna be.If you are already the kind of person u wanna be,there wont be hard choices.I believe that its telling you to reconsider ,to think about your future again.
Thank you for reading."
You may consider picking the choice that will lead to more possibilities. Never close loop on yourself.
That was a very complicated way of saying you shouldn't let other people make your choices for you.
12:18 even Esther Perrell (an extremely intelligent clinician) seems moved
She is absolutely brilliant
"""Hard choices are hard because there are no best options.""

"wonderful i feel so supportive, I  think what she means : follow your heart and keep on doing it , life with no regret is worth living"
"There's something I cannot make out from her sharing. In her talk, she talked about how staying true to yourself, or letting yourself to have your own standing in hard choices really makes who we truly are. But in order to state our own reasons in hard choices, we need to have the information about the choices we face. And only by asking for other people's opinions, or considering the merits between two choices do we come to acquire the information and finally conclude of which choices fit to us."
"thank you, i am currently at a crossroad at age 32, i have been struggling and didnt know whether to choose family marriage or career(multitasking is really not my thing). The increased salary metaphor is a great perspective.

"Some people below are saying this talk is redundant or meaningless, but they seem to miss the point. If you were hoping this speech would offer a perfect solution to whatever problem, then you're confirming her logic. There's no DVD or TED TALK that will give you the answer to a good or better life. Instead, recognize that YOU'RE the one creating the pros and cons for choosing between two subjects. Therefore, go ahead and write out the pros and cons, then choose based on which cons you're more willing to live with, knowing that YOU alone have made that choice. Also, it was really cool to see Esther Perel in the audience. Much love. =)"

"So according to this, here are the does and don't

Do realize scientific knowledge (what is) is different that values (ought to be)
Do realize science can delineate what is more, less or equal.  But ""oughts"" don't function the same way, these decision are on par with each other. . 
Do use normative powers - the power to create reasons - to have you make a decision that you can put yourself behind.  

Don't think one choice is better than the other, 
Don't forgo normative powers and become a drifter (let others give you reasons)
Don't overly sweat a pro and con list (one choice isn't better than the other)

Summary: Choose what you ought or want to become.  Create the compelling reasons for you choice.  Don't fall back on seocial pressure or personal fears.  

Question: - Its not always simple to have the right compass on what we want to become.  I'd argue the reason decisions can be so difficult is becuase we aren't sure what we want to be, even for her she couldn't decide between lawyer and philospher."

"Am in that position to make a hard choice and seriously am confuse. 
I traveled out to another country for greener pastures but the situation turns out not to be what I thought it was. I v to work for 12 to 14 hrs a day. My routine activities now is work, sleep and work. No social life nothing at all other than work. But due to exchange rate, if I send my salary to my home country is a big money. Now am thinking of returning to my home country but the problem is getting a job there will be hard and business is really a risk to start over there. But to continue leaving here seems like a prison which subjects me to cry almost everyday. 
If I stay here I make more money with no any good life. 
If I go back to my country, I make 4 times lesser to what I make here but I will have my freedom. 
I need an advice. Thanks"
So unfortunat that she's too bad of a speaker for me to be able to listen.

"I kinda don‚Äôt understand what she was getting at, how can there be no such thing as the ‚Äúbest choice‚Äù choices are chosen through verdict of the best outcome or the most pros.

The bad outcomes are used as a point of reference no? burn crack or don‚Äôt"
This will never die ... Trust me .... Never
Thank you for the important message.  I feel less anxious about tbe major life choices that I will make today.  I believe that I will start my life over one way and that it will be very positive.

"You amaze me, Ma'am. Thank you so much."
"Well as for me Options and hard choices can sometimes route NOT ON SOMEONES PERCEPTION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY GOOD BUT OUR SOCIETIES PERCEPTION OF WHICH ONE IS BETTER.
For example when choosing a dress eventhough you perceive both of your dress as beautiful and worth-wearing, you still have a hard time in chosing so you ask which one is better. 
True that in the end you're the one who will make the decision for yourself ""look inside"" ""who am i to be? "" but in the end We dont really know the ones which are good for us so we ask advice from PEOPLE who matters to us, the ones we loved. 

You see as an Asian being ""Practical"" routes to our family decissions and YOUR OWN PERSONALITY clashing in between them WILL make it hard for you. So you see, Even if My mindset say BOTH CHOICES I MAKE IS EQUALLY GOOD, SOCIETY will still Slap me on the face,my family, my friends, MY own fear, WILL MAKE IT HARD FOR ME TO ACCOMMODATE OR PERCEIVE EACH ONE OF my CHOICES AS BOTH GOOD. And Because EVERYONE WILL SAY that when choosing ""CHOOSE WHICH ONE IS BETTER"" SO IN THE END It will lead me think that choosing between finance and art, FINANCE is better as a job than being a graphical artist. The sector of succes really routes on their perception of success,MONEY AND INCOME. So for us to NOT make a mistake we chose to simply lead with the safe option in order for us to survive."

"One of the best little TED Talks in existence.  A hard choice doesn't have to be a BIG choice.  Once we learn to handle the small hard choices, the big choices seem less intractable.  Hard choices aren't hard because we are stupid, they are hard because we pay a lot of attention to the voice in our heads that tell us what we SHOULD choose.  Fear of the unknown pushes us to choose what we believe is the less risky option - usually not the best choice, in the end.  We assume that values are the same as scientific measurements (x is better, worse or equal to Y), they aren't.  So we have to create reasons to choose one or the other based on a range of values. Don't let the world decide for you, reflect on what you can put your agency behind. Hard choices make us fundamentally who we are.  Here's where I stand, ""I commit to chocolate donuts!"""
Life changing information found here
"Interesting how this talk seems to have polarised opinion. I don't have an answer to that, just as many feel Chang doesn't have an answer to 'how' exactly you might make a hard choice. But it worked for me. In my opinion, this talk is a brilliant, profound and timely statement about the nature of life's big decisions. It's familiar wisdom, only presented from an analytic philosopher's perspective. And it works."
"Ruth Chang you are indeed a philosopher! And a great one! Thank you so much, this is a life changing speech! Beautifully and gracefully laid out!"
Such a long talk...
"I've always been indecisive. So much I even ask what to buy, what to wear, who should i like... It's ridiculous. Maybe deep down I don't want to own up to my choices. But this video just solved years of confussion. Thank YOU!"

What makes a hard choice is how much you have to commit to it and not knowing if you will benefit from one or lose and create hardship for yourself with the other.  Difficulty in choosing your breakfast is simply an inability to make up your mind.  I'm out.
Didn't find it helpful

umm im decided between something in a game
thank you....
"This is why we need to value philosophers over bankers. A world full of new ideas and perspectives would help us evolve as a species, instead of constantly figuring out ways to exploit the systems, humans, animals and the planet for quick, 'worthless' profit."
"In order to decide what to do based on who you want to be (as this woman is suggesting), you have to first have some idea of what you value. This is the big problem. Many of us have a conflict of values. Do we decide based on the values of our parents? our religion? our best friend? our favorite rebel or celebrity? our favorite internet guru? a combination? If you are facing a tough decision, my advice to you is find out what YOUR values are, what matters most to YOU, and ignore everyone else's. And don't be ashamed of your values. Don't let anyone guilt trip you into caring more about something they value. For example, if you know inside your heart that personal freedom matters more to you than family, you should not have kids, no matter how much other people want you to. It will be a big mistake. If someday you change your mind and your values, then fine, become a parent, but only then. If you truly care more about creativity than financial security, choose a career that involves that over one that doesn't. If you have a choice (and some don't), then it's got to be your choice."
"I'm also going through the same puzzle. Since I'm a university student I have lots of option to choose but I'm unable to do so because I want to choose the best option in this process there are two ways for me. first, to go in Indian Administrative Services (IAS) or second to be a philosopher. I know at a day I have to decide it, and I'm waiting for the day.!"
One of the best TED lectures ever made.
"Amazing ted talk !
A biiig thank you !"
"I'm gloating just a bit. Our life is always determined by the little choices.  The result of your life is made up of a million little choices.  I think of family relationships. Taking the time day to day. One mundane task after another. Day after day, month after month, year after year. In the end, you know the saying on your death. ""I wish I took less time at the office."" Life happiness abundance is all around you. You own it already. Are you going to choose to see it and massage it, gain knowledge from it? Or are you focusing on anything everything else that you have no control over anyway."
Wow this is so boring and tiring. It explains why choices are difficult but doesn‚Äôt help to solve difficult choices.
"That's the problem with philosophers n Arts graduates... they talk so much many a times they say what is obvious and what life has already taught us atleast someone in mid 30s... we can't quantify pros n cons of country living n urban living prima facie and we know it... who we are we are and we don't need to remind yourself who we are, our actions n decisions represent who we are... these are all obvious things engrained in our behaviour... she is just doing reverse engineering of the thought process of decision making..."
"This vid seems to explain what the hard choices are, the benefits of choosing hard choices, and how to compare them. However, I like a comment said to weight your inner self more than others' might be the answer for someone. 'For me', this vid doesn't really help."
So powerful. Thank you!
This was incredible.
Gud luv it
She reminds me of the shrink in Rick and Morty
"Yes, unless you're being drifted by the harsh realities that the kids you've been left with need to eat and go to the doctor.  Let's get real, most folk aren't choosing between philosophy and law, they're choosing between customer and food service, or maybe worse.  And yes, these choices, along with things out of their locus of control *do* shape people, yet we judge them for being angry, depressed, or not having the education or time for an edifying TED talk like this one."
I don't want to be a drifter. I want to take charge of my life and make hard choices. Your video came JUST IN TIME. Thank you. God bless.
What a great talk! Full of wisdom
What a great talk! Full of wisdom
"Great concept but the marriage choice? Who really does that? To be deeply in love with two people at the same time, have gotten to know both so intimately, already sharing your life with both? Does that happen?"
"Unnecessary complication of choice. Choice is a word we made, an illusion. You have the illusion that you can choose, but each of us has a linear path set upon us, we just don't see it. Every choice is based on things outside of our control."
I don‚Äôt understand a thing she said :(
Great video. She's not talking in circles. It's called the socratic method.
Do what you want to become. Because your decisions make who you are.
This wasn‚Äôt helpful for me.

Excellent presentation on hard choices. I can't imagine it being presented any better. Thanks so much for the eye-opening  and mind-opening information!
i was wondering if i could use this video for a school project
"Amazing!!!!!! Well said, how insightful"
My hard choice is if I should have eye surgery right away or when I‚Äôm an adult cuz I‚Äôm 11 and u had crooked eyes all my life I‚Äôm so scared idk what to do
Damn ! Them Chinese sure are smart !
"But would it have mattered if she had put her agency behind becoming a lawyer and once she got there, hated it? Wouldnt the outcome have been the same?"
"Some people never get the point mentioned about 5 minutes into the video. IMO, it is our education system which thinks science or anything that can be broken down through reductionism is better than thinking like outlined in this TED talk. Visualization can help in the process, something that reductionist thought can never duplicate.

That is why for many Westerners, this process either happens later in life (> 60 yo), or when the person experiences an event that shatters their reality, like a bankruptcy."
"How to make hard choices: become more concerned about the person that you are. Now, how to choose between being concerned about the person that I am, and being unconcerned with the person that I am..."
Very true points! Good message and eloquently spoken :)
This is the best Ted talk I've ever seen. Blow my mind
"Might sub after watching, really like the vid."
Wtf
"I saw this video 3 or 4 times, in years. First times I thought she was not catching the point. Today, that some thigns in my life taught me the importance of the inner space as a starting point to make decisions, this video start to make sense. It's very inspiring! Give to her an other chance, watch the video again. I think that her theory (""on a par"" + ""reason for us"") is the only way to take hard decisions and live them good. (sorry for my english)"
There is no correct way to make a hard choice but she explains a effective mechanism i guess...

"WOW! Thank You Ruth Chang, for this talk and for becoming a philosopher ... and for providing a clear path in how we make those hard choices ...  and I have also watched the video that was next in YT's line up and  I think yours and hers together are a perfect blend in aid to making hard choices. (other video is""Tough decisions -use your heart"" by Alison Meyer) ... Love and Peace to All"
"Thankfully you choose philosophy, simply put biological species are comparators by default design for ease of survival by learned behavior.

Biological species are the only entities that observe time, time that does not exist in absolute reality which begs the question of biological species design by a survival default, basically a feedback system for best survival."
"This is the problem with postmodern thought: we begin with opinion and fight to support it, assuming that it is right because we say so. However, even our opinions are based on assumptions every bit as they are on wish. Science can test the validity of the assumptions. How much does your model of the universe overlap with said universe? To claim you have no obligation to any such overlap may indicate you are wealthy and receive little feedback on your mistakes. You end up with what could be called insanity or stupidity--that is, you've lost contact with reality. Self justification without recourse to intelligence and reality is not beautiful, but hideous, ludicrous."

"Thanks Ruth, excellent talk"
"Then what option should you give reasons to? Which alternate should I choose to give reasons to? ""Better"" is such a vague term. It is the time limit what forces us to make a choice. And we do it without analyzing all the data, we can't analyze it though. I'm a student of physics and philosophy and the concept of choice is messing my mind since I had been in situation to choose between two colleges. Considering certain factors can make choice easy but even factors are to be chosen too. So I am following what Alan watts said about ""choice""."

"I got a headache from this video. Don't overthink choices. YOUR life is definitely not ""randomness""! If you want to become something and you have the desire for it just take the hard choice and put in the work it needs. Close the alternative door, move on and accept the choices you made (good or bad). With philosophers, it's like with monks or Buddhists: While thinking about the life they are just missing life by doing nothing."
brilliant this really helped
"OMG!!! how scary!! the video started with some choices and the first 3 choices are the biggest choices i am currently making 0.0 the coincidence is unreal!

1. be an artist or an accountant 
2. live in the city or the country side
3. :-) (ps, no im not two timing)

im actually moving to a new country next yr for my studies and i have two choices: the capital city or the countryside AND im in the middle of an inner fight of whether i should follow my passion for art or my be an accountant :-))"
"i get what you meant to share..
Life's exactly in between of what you wish for, and what you didn't."
"Great video, very helpfull"
This is my absolute favorite TED talk and gives me comfort before each hard choice I make. Elegant and compelling. Thank you Dr. Chang.
Thank you. That really helped me in thinking about my options in a positive way.
"Very well justified speech , I think it was perfectly put together on how you need to find yourself and what you would like to be defined as also i read a comment earlier saying "" when something bad happens you have three choices you can let it define you let it destroy you or let it strengthen you"" I think that is learnt by bad decisions and even if they occur nothing happened you cant blame yourself as you couldnt have known. I think you just cant overthink too much as that will just make you feel worse you need to simply give things a try"
We create our own reasons that ultimately defines us.
Great video. I can now start on my essay.
Good speech and revealing
"Great Ted Talk. However, speaking to Ruth Chang, I think your conclusion would have been more powerful had it been a little more concise. As a disclaimer, I will add, I do not get (nor have I ever gotten) paid to write, speak, or persuade."
Amazing :)
Amazing and insightful lecture!  Loved it!
"Am i the only one who feels like this was a total waste of time? Besides repeating herself for the first 7 minutes, the only thing she had to add was that values cannot be measured. :/"
Arabic translation please?
"My perplexity about this talk deals with finding a concrete solution to the problem. The speaker figured out in a very brilliant way what the problem is about, where the fundamental issue lies, but at the end of her speech I didn't feel like I got a new way to face hard choices.
I agree with the idea that there's no way to apply quantitative comparisons to values and so we can't say that an option is better than another. I also agree with the consideration that hard choices are chances to shape ourselves as we want to be in our life.
But, in my opinion, the real problem is here: what is the best choice if I want to be like THAT?
So many times we know what we want from life, but we can't figure out the best path to get to it. I can listen to myself, to the emotional part of me, to understand what I really want from life, what I desire, so I know how I want to shape myself, but I don't know what tools I have to choose to obtain this shape."

"Magnifique ! <3 
Gratitude..."
I can see clearly now; the rain is gone.
"This talk struck a chord with me. I also ""drifted"" into becoming into a law student; and when people asked me why I became a lawyer, I told them I was the ""least uncertain"" about my career path. Seeing things from the perspective of the talk gave me some insight as to how I implicitly chose the person I wanted to become. Thanks Ted!"
"a philosopher believes there's free will is not a philosopher. a philosopher believes there's no free will is not a philosopher either.  Ms Chang, through you speech i can tell why lawyer isn't a good job for you. arm chair philosophizing can never be good. because, there's no armchair as we know it. we knew it, and we will know it."
all the guys look thrilled that their wives drug them there
"we should, we should, we should... we CAN make a choice but not SHOULD, this is not a duty."

"Great video, very relevant for personal decisions.
However, I wonder what she recommends about hard choices in the public context. Unfortunately, this notion of building oneself through personal decisions doesn't really hold, and it should become possible to quantify values, in order to take decisions in the best common interest."
Very interesting and enlightening but making it no easier to make hard choices.
"*There is really 1 hard choice for you to make, the choice of living in your mind* ( living out of the pleasure seeking controlling dreammachine) *Or living in reality* ( seeing life how it really is meant to be, without the manifestations of the mind intruding the Present) People live in the prison of the mind, if it isnt fear, it is fantasy, anger, greed. *Your number 1 choice should be unslaving yourself out of the mind prison*) Even if you do not know the nature and the secrets of the mind, your mind will always try to be your master. There is only 1 way to unslave yourself out of the mental prison. Learn the *Real Truth* about the mind , learn how life works in general. Google *TruthContest read the Present*"
"After 1.15 min, I made my choice"
This is the single best video I have ever watched on Youtube. And I like to watch it again every now and then.
"Dr. Chang, this talk is a your gift to the world, and I thank you for so beautifully delivering it to us. I watch this every time I need to make a difficult choice. Thank you so much."
Enlightening! I watch this each time I have a hard decision to make.
this video is just mental masturbation. hard choices allow us to pick our future. the end.
I watched this and in my opinion truly I did not learn anything from it. Most of it are common sense and explaining the common sense did not open up anything for me. It was just a nice and forgettable presentation
This isn't helpful at all if you're even moderately self aware and trying to make a difficult decision.
Really useful! Thank You.
Great. Simply great.
"Does that suggest that people who are on a fence about voting for Donald Trump as a president should just go and vote for him if they ""feel like it"" instead of seeking for more information and better ways to reason until the the choice becomes more clear?"

Shout out to Mrs Burnett
She just explained the major methodological problems with use of the scientific method in Social Sciences; such as Economics. is unequal to ought and the problem with quantification of values.
"The overall message of ""Hard choices are good."" was alright, but she fumbled it when she talked about choices both being unequal and also having neither be better than the other. Those are two mutually exclusive attributes... one or the other must be false. It sounds more like it's the case that since our reasons for choosing one over the other is subjective, then there's no ""better"" option. That's fair. But when you use language like that you muddy objectivity with subjectivity and it just sounds murky and contradictory."
this helped me somewhat... brain twister .. but I liked it a lot..
"How do i choose between something i want horribly bad but probably wont end up shaping me into the person i hope to be, or staying somewhere i hate but it has 2 huge factors that has kept me there for the past 2 years. if it wasn't for the relationships i've formed with these 2 factors (they arent people), there's no doubt in my mind id be doing exactly what i want... but now i'm stuck between not knowing whether or not it will be better for me in the end."

"To bring back the is-ought-gap in order to underline the power of our individual constructivism in life is a good starting point, but I don't see how this can truly help anyone. The trouble arises only once one has already understood that one has to be the author of one's life, and upon realization that there are paths that might not only be worse for one's own life than others, but that might even be deeply regretted later on in life. All these considerations come from individual experience, not from an illegitimate resort to science. There are better and worse alternatives for every life story, and ignorance about both the development of the self in each scenario and the scenario itself make choices hard. 'I did it my way' surely is not a great song if the melody is bad."
Not a nihilist then.

"How to make hard choices?
Make your choice and create reason for your choice."
I have to make a difficult decision and after watching this video it has given me a better perspective; however I am still unsure of my decision. I would like to attend Nevada State high school which is a school where I would be able to get college credit and even graduate with an associates degree before even getting my High School Diploma. The school is Free and I would be saving a lot of money. The problem is that I'm not sure if I should leave my current magnet school East Tech. The main reason I wouldn't want to leave this school is because of what I was going to experience in the Medical Program. I'm just not quite sure which decision I should make:/
Very very good
This actually helped alot i have now i big discusion to make: learn about robots or learn Chemics and physics im not rly sure What to do but i do have another thinking position so.... THANK YOU

"I go by another choice. when different things arise, be creative. find a way to make the best out of the two or three things. if you want a career in art but also think of going for banking. then find your passion on your free time and work your day at work at the bank which can ge a lesser passion, to say so. how about asking the bank to do a mural outside the building, and surround your office with art work and some artistic books?"

Worst ted talk I have seen so far...
New vision!
"I don't know what to do, I want to buy a game but I also want to spend my money on making a Five Nights At Freddy's mask can anyone in the comments help me? (Thumbs up for me to buy a game) (thumbs down for me to make Five nights at Freddy's mask)"
"I don't necessarily agree. It's always best to make decisions based on as much research as possible - this helps us see the choices for as much as they actually are. She's making out most life decisions are on a par - which they are not. For example, I love art and I love maths. I love art a bit more. But in the current job market where I live and bearing in mind my family and not so privileged background, it's VERY difficult to get a graphic design job and very easy to get a banking job. I don't ""see myself"" as a banker, at all, but ultimately, it's the better choice for me as I'll be OK financially.

I find it notoriously difficult to make choices (paralysis by analysis), but one thing that helped me to become better was:

- Research, find the answers then make the decision (let it make itself)

DON'T

- Make the decision based on feelings and then find the answers to justify it

When you do the second option, it rarely ""sits"" well."
"This was very insightful, thank you. However, I still cannot seem to make my decision. The two things I've been looking forward to the most this year. The last musical my school will hold in this auditorium, because they're going to tear it down, or being able to have fun in a huge mall and stay at a hotel somewhere before presenting my science fair project. Today I've been informed that both of these are on the same day, and I can't make my decision. I'm also considering asking the musical director to reschedule the musical so I can still be able to preform in it and experience both opportunities, but I'm too shy and the answer will probably a no. :("
That was awesome
very very enlightening
"Executive summary: after exhausting all sources of information that might help to promote one choice over another, and the outcomes of both choices still seem to be equivalent, then go with your gut (since this choice will inherently represent you as an individual). Freewill FTW."

"There are no hard choices - but sometimes humans don't act courageous enough to make them, and then say they are ""hard""."

"lol after reading the comments before i watched the vid, i feel like i shouldnt watch it...but i'll watch it anyways"
The only part worth listening to is the last 60 seconds or so....If you're actually looking to hear something that is more mature about decisions then listen to Osho on the concept of choiceless awareness. That will make these Ted Talks look like kid's play.¬†

"The problem with most philosophy is that often there's too much thinking and not enough insight.  Thinking by nature is drawn out and convoluted.  Insight is clear, simple and concise.  Insight is mainly gained through experience, not sitting in an armchair. "
"I read some bad comments on the video above and was about to make the choice of clicking away when I decided to hear what she had to say for myself. Don't let the world dictate your choices, whether it be hard or easy. Those who didn't get the full message should re-watch the video..."
"what i only understood that there is no hard choice, the one which seems hard compare to other one, the hard is best one.. and one more ;-) the option we leave will always seem to us better than taken one ;-) can any one explain me in one line how to make hard choice. help"
"subjectivity versus objectivity , good thinking"
"Thank you #Ruth . It helped me a lot in choosing a right option between the two which were ""On the par""
Great to hear to you"
"This didn't help AT ALL :( I came here to see how can I make taking a decision easier , not to feel that it's a bless -_- I'm dissapointed"
This doesnt help at all to make a hard choice
"should be titled ""Why Hard Choices Are Not A Curse""... cause clearly, this doesn't teach you how to make hard choices... ;)"
This is amazing. :) 
Damn this talk has so few views for its insightfulness...
Did she say anything interesting in the last three minutes? ¬†I got too bored to carry on watching!
She's Remarkable
Being with the end in mind. Fear is what got us into making hard choices. Measure the consequences and probably we'll be able to make better choices and not doing it out of impulse. 
Did not understand anything
Thank you for making this talk and saving my life.
"I feel like the talk is rather misnamed - she didn't tell us 'how' to make hard choices but rather to appreciate the ones that were there which help make us a person with better insight. Rather off-topic, I was expecting something more helpful and tangible."
We really didn't know that we have the power to create reasons....come on.
why comments are not moderate?
great talk Ms chang gives new dimension¬† how we can make our hard choices correctly.
So I got nothing from that lol gonna rewatch...she didnt really discribe how? But why choices are hard and to look within yourself to see what your values are and if they match with the choices you make....blah blah. Basicaly I think she saying you already know the answer internally.
"I think her sentiment is interesting. If I understand correctly, sometimes we cannot make our decision by compare which choice is better (may be by social norm), if it can be compared and you can choose by this method.OK, it greats.

But sometime choice are on par or cannot be compare because they are providing with different value. That's a time we make our own reason by asking which one do I really want. That's like a free will that we can choose choice by ourselves and not be slave by reasons by choosing somethings even with no one is better. Instead we create reason by our free will.

It may quite simplifies decision process and you may not feel you learn anything new. Sometimes we do this unconsciously. This lecture does not give an answer that which hard choice is ""better"" because that is not possible to do by itself."
"The alternatives for hard choices are neither better than the other, nor are they equally good. When making hard choices, we should go for one of the alternatives for the reasons created by ourselves rather than those given. Hard choices are precious opportunities for us to explore and develop our human conditions which were buried deeply in subconsciousness. Forget about ""for""s and ""against""s, it's our heart that is speaking to ourselves. Remarkable speech."
"I believe she failed to address that choices can be set up with weighting of all the factors in a choice, which should make it a lot clearer as well as expose the person's self-definition. However, I thought she was a bit manipulative by calling people ""drifters"" in their choices. This was to put a negative light on people that are perceived to do those type of choices. This way people would want to be included in here little non-drifting club and subsequently would have to like her talk because if they didn't then they would be not liking themselves. She's just reiterating a point made in a writing by Herb Sheppard - A PATH WITH A HEART:
THE CULTURAL CONTEXT OF LEARNING ABOUT CAREERS. Go back to law because philosophy is dead."
I think that you must compare what you actually use to compare like: What is more important? Being healthy or having amazing 3 minutes while eating a dunnut? people would have very different responses.
"Choose according to reasons you create yourself rather than according to reasons given is path to liberty!? It is a good idea but only a first step. If the reasons you create are your impulses you'll be slave of them. When you want to choose, be first sure of not being slaves of you bad impulses: laziness, eagerness, selfishness...."
"""We unwittingly assume that values like beauty and kindness are akin to scientific quantities like length, mass and weight."" This sounds so much like an argument against cost-benefit analysis - we cannot do CBA because we cannot put everything into monetary values."
"In other words, watch Simon Sinek, ""Start with WHY""."
"Overly itemizing and then littering the stage with an unnecessary amount of possible options, just to show how well she can deftly tip toe through the mess she's created? How else are you going to get people to follow your lead?"
"i don't agree with most of what is said. I think she knows to little of 'science' to say that chosing for something is not like comparing numbers.

it is only ignorance which makes choices hard. They are hard because they are unclear and they are unclear because of lack of knowledge. ¬†

only chosing between 2 actually equal things seems hard. i guess you'd have to use the random function to solving that equation."
This is actively used by marketers to manipulate people. Cognitive Dissonance. People make up all sorts of stuff/reasons to justify their choices.¬†
She should read Ayn Rand
"Way too abstract no psychology. Typical modern philosophy student, trying to apply philosophy to solve a cognitive problem. She made the wrong choice of studying philosophy instead of psychology.¬†"
"I enjoyed this talk, as it could relate to our religious choices, whether we stay the way we are, or reach out and take on the new.¬† Whether to continue our life as we are, or to change to become a better person.¬†"
"Another excellent TED Talk, indeed.
The most difficult part of making a 'hard choice' is immediately overcome when you have a mission statement. Write one for yourself. Now."
"You should watch "" WTF Bending A Mans Mind "" Such a good movie."
"Should have been named: ""Why the hard choices are hard"" or ""Why the hard choices are not the easy choices"". I think I actually heard something about ""How to make hard choices"", one short phrase in the last three minutes of the video... But I'm not sure."
"There is no reason to believe that there does not exist a quantitatively better option in any given decision. More likely, you are just too ignorant to make a 100% perfect choice. In that case you'd rely on emotion, or gut feelings, to guide you. It's just another cognitive tool, it is no way a superior way to define you nor does it make you more free."
"Darn... I've always wanted to be a bum and do nothing with my life.... But society dictates that I have to get a job and pay taxes.... It's such a hard choice, that's why I'm letting society decides for me.¬†"
This assumes we have the 'free will' to really choose anything. ¬†
"I like this way of making choices. ""Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life. ¬†Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important."" - Steve Jobs"
"Hard choices need not be dependent solely on one's wishes. After all, we owe something to the society as well..."
I honestly thank all the comments that summarized this talk up into less than a paragraph.
"Lets just remember that choice does not take place in a power vacuum shall we. Lets just remember that all people do not face hard choices on similar terms. In my mind is the image of a fat american tourist telling a handicapped indian child beggar that regardless of your situation a positive outlook is really always preferable. This ""making ourselves"" is hardly a risk free exercise, and no, tossers, the universe does not actively reward courage, and persistence, sacrifice and dedication does not automatically win the day, and nor does picking up the pieces and getting back on the horse. Life is real. Its not about the choice of which flavour of ice cream. Beyond choice - there is what is just actually possible. If you find you disagree you go start up a local paper called ""critical political review"" in north Korea while feeding a family of five. The world is not primarily decided by individual choice. You have it - but its mostly severely limited by factors beyond your control and its not free. Enough with this boy scout TED up-beatness. If things were simple we would not be troubled by them, and the difficulty of choice is not an illusion. ""Should i become an artist or a banker"" thats a first world problem if I ever saw one."
Another thing about drifters is that they are never truly happy. They don't know what they want and they're annoyed about other people choosing for them.
Very interesting talk.
Constructive criticism: Her conclusion could have been reached far quicker. Overall message (as I understood it to be): We make our own realities. Descent TED talk.
"It reminded me that although I can think and support the scientific way, I also have to know who I am and based on experience or trail and error I can know what is best for me and the people around me."
"she put questions, but could not deliver proper answers"
"How to make hard choices? ¬†The lawyer in me says... ""it depends....."""
"So... now that I'm informed on why choices are hard... HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO MAKE HARD CHOICES? She barely even touched on what was supposed to be the thesis for her talk....
*disappointed*"
"She's talking about the difference between what we value and what we think we should value. So it's not too long a stretch (for me) to say she's talking about conflict & confusion that arise when we're caught between what we value and what those around us value, or what we think they value. 'Drifters' who let the world decide for them are simply the people most cut off (perhaps by a domineering upbringing or bullying... or even advertising) from what they value. Without being aware of it, they don't see that as enough reason to choose something."
@10:39. grrr show the slide.
But I don't know who I am nor who I want to become.
"Oh wow 
I watched this just at the right time.
It's important to examine and understand motives behind the choices we make. And sometimes the choice isn't hard to ourselves, but based on external factors (finances, convenience, the opinion of others) the fear outweighs the original conviction of the choice. Basically the message here is - don't make choices on these transient factors. They won't be a constant in your life, but YOU will. And you will live with your choices, always."
Very Timely
"I think hard choices come from being incomparable to us, even if they are completely comparable given total information. We can only compare our expectations, and I for one really really distrust. And so I've got effectively 0 information, but I feel like I'm still responsible for the result. Sure I can convince myself option A is best, but if I'm wrong in retrospect I can only blame me making the wrong reasons.

So I beat my head against a wall, because I've got 0 reason to believe I actually have a hard decision before me."
"BEST QUOTES...SPARK NOTES!
""the world of value is different from the world of science, the stuff of one world can be quantified by real numbers, the stuff of the the other world can't""
""it is here in the space of hard choices that we get to exercise our normative power...the power to make yourself into the person [you will become]""
""this response in hard choices is a rational response, but it is not dictated by reasons given to us, rather reasons created by us...we become the authors of our own lives""
""people who don't exercise their normative choices are drifters...they allow the world to dictate the direction of their lives. The lesson of hard choices: REFLECT ON WHAT YOU CAN PUT YOUR AGENCY BEHIND AND WHAT YOU CAN BE FOR, AND THROUGH HARD CHOICES, BECOME THAT PERSON!""

Overall thoughts...Great moments with a lot of filler! Like a good tasting beer with a lot of empty calories.¬†"
"I could summarize in a few words:
Study the choices thoroughly, then follow your intuition.
Intuition is that distinction she talks about.
Your welcome in advance!"
"Just make a choice, then make so that it turns out to be a good one."
"marry Betty or Veronica, that's the real dilemma. Lollita isn't even in the picture."
TED is becoming a stage for so called experts to promote their pseudoscience.¬† She ain't even provided evidence/statistical analysis.¬† TED's quality is diminishing over time.¬†
"Many years ago I read the book Smart Choices, by Hammond, Keeney, and Raiffa. It was good, but I always felt it was missing something, and this video finally showed me what it was. Thanks so very much!"
"Very well done.  Understanding choice as an infinite power that produces variable outcomes. The lesson s are many. Choosing from insight vs choosing from cultural, family influences. The closing sets the right tone, seeing choice as a gift vs a curse. Taking this perception changes the road you will choose and the way you will ""reason"" your way into making a decision. Hidden message, there is risk in every choice."
"I disagree with this talk, there *is* such a thing as the better alternative. The problem is that you don't have all the information when making the choice. If you would know that the banking job will leave you miserable and unfulfilled and the arts job would leave you a little poorer but happy, you'd know what to choose.
And of course the choice would be different for different people. Of course you need to take your personality into consideration. That doesn't mean you can say: ""Oh, it's different for everyone, so it's incomparable""."
Tieng   viet
"Wow mind blowing
Now I have many reasons to be me :')"
"I can't decide if I liked this or not, hmm."
In a perfect world there should be no hard choices.¬†
12:00 - 12:05. I'm for chocolate donuts. That laugh after makes me giggle more than joke.
Talking in circles....
"I've always gone Science-mode on these things.
Amazing! Thought evoking and insightful that she CHOSE to see hard choices this way, and shared it.
I'M the one writing this Book!"
"""Hard choices give us the power to create reasons for ourselves?"" Her assumption is flawed in 2 ways.
(1) By saying above, she is assuming that in making so call ""easy"" choices, everyone will make the same choice. We all know it is not true.
(2) Greater flaw in her logic is that, based on her definition of ""hard"" choices, every choice we make is a ""Hard"" choice because every choice we make, there is underlying values and preferences. Even so called ""drifter"" she mentioned, made a ¬†choice to let their environment influenced their choice and reasons can be made to justify anything we do.

Real waste of time watching this. The worst Ted talk I have watched ever."
"Interesting talk. ¬†It's pretty congruent with how value-based decision making works as an ordinal ranking system rather than a quantitative value system. ¬†In the end, it requires self-knowledge to determine correct choices, difficult or easy."
"here is a way to view this: you have a choice to make between becoming a banker and an artist. the way i see one should make a choice is not what any of these alternatives offer, but what you would expect from a choice. in this case, what you would expect from a job. maybe you would expect to be active and work with children. that qualifies you as a kindergarten teacher. all in all, what i am saying is that you should not look at the first alternatives when making a choice, but know what you want from making that choice and look somewhere else in case you are not satisfied"
"It depends on individuals that we think whether our choices are good or bad, however, most important thing she wants to say is that we just need to have encourages to struggle with hard choices which we can't choice easily."
Good presentation. It could be done in 10 minutes with the same information but less tiring.
Or both suitcases  have no weight at all a figment of imagination 
"I like her argument, but I want to make a small correction.


In the second to the end leg of the speech she said that the world of science is different from the world of value. That people want to quantify the value of choice A numerically, and it simply doesn't work that way.


I think everything is numerically quantifiable, but a scientific approach is not always the most efficient. I really do believe if you spent enough time you could make the right choice scientifically, using all the information at your disposal. This would take waay too long and you're better off just 'feeling' what's best for you.


Her last point was 'making reasons'. She said that hard choices allow you the opportunity to recreate yourself in your decision. This is an excellent thought, probably more important than the choice itself is your own perseverance in it. More often than not I've failed in a decision and reverted to the alternative, not because the alternative was better but simply because I reevaluated at the first hardship. After all alternatives were exhausted and I was on the last good choice, I realized that each choice would have been equally hard and equally rewarding, stumbling on the decision did nothing but waste time."
Those talks are gettin worse and worse. I hope this is a build up to another great one! And EGGS ARE BETTER THAN THE NUMBER 9!
"Don't watch the video, read this comment and you know what she was saying basicly:
""You do you""
There, saved you 15 minutes of empty. This is why people think we philosophers have nothing to say."
Pas tout compris...Anglais scolaire !! Dommage..!!!!
"If you are reading this comment while contemplating watching this video let me make the decision easier for you, don't. It's a waste of time. ¬†¬†"
"""We have the power to create reason.""
Also the idea of destiny and fate comes into play, not with solely hard decisions, but all decisions. Are these decisions pre-destined? Do we actually make the choice ourselves?"
"Artist or Accountant

I have had this exact problem. How did you know?"
"honestly im looking at these comments makes me not wanna watch this i listened to the first 5 minutes and i really dont like it. she doenst eben look good, yes its a juxtaposition but still in my oppinoin this video is garbage dont even watch it, as i wrote this the vidoe played sounding stupider and stupider every second"
I think the whole point of the talk was to make choices by being true to yourself
"Choices become even harder when its not an option of action versus action, it's an option of action versus inaction. ¬†Where to take the action is very very likely to improve your situation, but your situation is acceptable as it is, and its easy with no risk to stay where you are.

For example, I'm a computer scientist working as a chemist. ¬†I have a great work environment, I get a steady pay, and everything is low stress. ¬†But if I quit and pursue software engineering, I may earn a lot more money, and have an occupation more suited to my talent, and therefore likely be more fulfilled. ¬†So the alternative looks superior, it feels to me to be the superior choice, but it's just so darn easy to stay where I am."
I didnt need the 12 minute introduction bs.
This talk was about 5 minutes longer than it needed to be
"Too many easy choices means someone is manipulating you.¬†

I've decided to make my life philosophy, ""Always take the Third Option.¬† If none is immediately apparent, liberally apply motorcycles/parachutes/C4."""
"so, when making hard choices, choose the option that leads you to become the person you wish you were, dont fall back on social pressures or personal fears.

there, i saved you 14 minutes."
Great talk. Like ring to the finger. Thanks TED and Ruth Chang.
"2 SENTENCE SUMMARY: Hard choice? Whole-heartedly chose from ""inside"" yourself and don't let societal pressures or fear of the unknown factor into your rational yet non-scientific decision."
"this was great, thanks¬†"
Very good.¬†
"every choice is hard for me. ¬†I am chronically indecisive, paralyzed¬†"
worthless
"There are two things that bothered me here. The first is the somewhat offhand distinction she makes between ""is"" and ""ought,"" which does nothing to advance her argument. Second, her talk practically labels those who do not have a developed sense of self as weak individuals with no sense of will to create the kind of person they must become. Some people just don't know, either because of interest in a broad variety of things or because of choice paralysis brought on by emotional and psychological abuse. She acts like it is the fault of the decision maker for not being able to determine how they wish to structure their lives. Very flimsy, as philosophical talks often are."
"""When you come upon a difficult life choice think about who you will become when you choose one or the other. Use that to inform your choice rather than the qualities of the choices themselves."""
"All she said was ""value is subjective"" and stretched it out to 15 minutes."
Snoooooozefest.
"I knew before watching this video that I could ""create my own reasons"" to backward rationalize any choice I have made or will make.  But if the criterion for making hard choices is ""who I will be called to become,"" how do I make the hard choice of ""who I want to become""?  And how can I possibly know in advance exactly who I might be called to be from one choice or another?  In other words, how does this video add anything to anybody's ability to make hard choices?"
Value isn't just value FOR YOURSELF. Value is value FOR MORE THAN JUST YOURSELF. The difference that your choice makes is not just DIFFERENCE FOR YOURSELF. It is difference FOR MORE THAN JUST YOURSELF.¬†
Here's an easy decision for you; don't watch this video. She should of stuck with being a lawyer. Complete nonsense...
So ... why didn't she CHOOSE to CREATE reasons and become a laywer? Her argument is flawed in her own story ffs ...
"Would you rather have 15 feet of tootsie rolls, or 15 pounds of beef jerky? Both have the same value (15) but different units and substance. This ""neighborhood of value"" she brings up is nonsensical because we can still make it analogous to mathematical concepts and there remains only the three options, but when the unit and/or substance is different you cannot use less than, greater than, or equal to, unless the units in question are convertible to each other (for example, feet and miles)."
"This is typical self-help guff disguised as philosophy; ie. ""Don't change the world, change yourself."" In my experience, changing the ""world"" is easier and more productive. It's what humans do."
"I am thinking she discovered something that people in her age discover. That we just have to make the choice to suit us in some sort of meaning of our lifes. And... you are going back to good/bad choice. ""a par"" is just something she came up with to make it more scientific or for the credit purposes I guess. But altogether... it is a nice summary of this idea/problem."
Are you already an author of you're own liveliness?
12:01 ~Cries~ !
"Never ever have a Youtube video had better timing. Thank you Ruth (and TED), much love to you."
Betty or Lolita? WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO VERONICA???
Some TED talks are amazing. ¬†This one was fucking brutal. ¬†Hard to sit through and irrelevant.¬†
"what more is this saying other than ""be yourself""/humanities propaganda"
"""What we do in hard choices is very much up to each of us."" Wow, thank you very much for this nugget of wisdom, your holiness Dalai Lama. I could have never come to this brilliant conclusion on my own.

I'm sorry, but this really was nearly 15 minutes of pure concentrated nothingness. If you want an intriguing talk about choices, do check ""Barry Schwartz: The paradox of choice"". There's a link at the end of this video."
flipping a coin is the best way to choose between two options.
I don't think the consequence of my breakfast choice has the same weight as uprooting my life.¬† THAT is where the turmoil usually comes from.¬†
"I like this topic because, I'm in a situation were I can go for Fashion designing or wall-street. It is pretty hard because one is my childhood passion, and the other is more about the capital.. I really need help with this.. HELP ME!"
nothing to see here..what a waste of my time
"

"
She made a bad choice (even though it's an easy decision) of cutting her hair short like a man.¬† I can't stand to watch short-haired women lecture. Thumbs down.
"In other words, the subjective theory of value."
10:00 - 10:10 the woman in the audience enjoys 11 blinks!! Haha!
"Her basic premise is wrong. She asserts hard choices are hard because they're equally good, with no evidence to support that. If there is anything at all to support making one decision over another, it is the better option. She also separates our inner wants from material desires for no reason, doesn't understand basic math or science, is dichotomizing ""realms"" (science is completely separate from values, according to her), and is basically irrational. Overrall she comes off as a wannabe decision theorist."
7:28 is when the talk basically starts.
"People take what they want from anything. I found this helpful, my husband, not so much. Everyone is different. That's the beauty of being human :)"
Values are not 'unscientific' their order relationship is merely not total.
"In a nutshell: Be true to yourself, instead of conforming to societal expectations and living your own life based on what the society thinks it should be."
"That was a very interesting talk. At first I thought it was going nowhere but as time went on, I understood the argument and, well, it all comes down to this:

You should make your hard decisions based on who you want to become. The outcome of a hard decision is your creating the reasons to justify that choice and embracing them."
The whole presentation summed up: Don't a drifter choosing safer options choose the option which makes you who you are! The title is kind of misleading it doesn't really give you a direct answer and she seems to be talking in circles just so the presentation lasts longer. In all honesty this didn't really teach me anything lol
I'd like to know Ruth Chang's thoughts about making hard choices when both choices are bad.
well.. i'm against choklade donuts and banking.. so it's fairly easy
Turn ma swag on
"DON'T LET THIS GAL FORCE YOU INTO A DECISION.

The fear of becoming a ""DRIFTER"" is the wrong reason to making a hard choice.
As a DRIFTER, I understand the pros and cons (and the values associated) presented by all alternatives, but why should I want to be FOR¬†something because I don't want to be FOR nothing? When I'm ready to be FOR something I will choose to be FOR that thing, which, may not even be in the alternatives at hand.
Not to mention, life is full of RANDOMNESS. Chance encounter can be beautiful."
Great stuff.
----
What a bunch of garbage.. this isn't TED worthy
Isn't studying hard choices more of a psychological thing than philosophical?
love these talks
"I feel like she is talking in circles, good topic though"
I learned nothing. Seriously how could this possibly be helpful?
