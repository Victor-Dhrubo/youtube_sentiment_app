"The theory of Dyson spheres is at best absurd, at worst, ludicrous.
To think that a civilisation capeable of constructing a mega structure around it's star to capture energy,
Would endeavour to do so, while other forms of limitless energy would be available to that advanced civilisation,
Is plain silly.
We, here, now, are on the verge of fusion energy, limitless cheap energy,
Other more exotic energy will be available within the next one hundred years.
The mere construction around a star would probably use all of the material from dozens of planets, the length of construction measured in thousands of years,
Whatever planets remained in those solar systems would see dramatic, maybe even catastrophic falls in sunlight, weather pattern carnage, and eco systems collapse.

"Too many natural explanations.

Or, instead of our system which has 8 planets, this system has 140.  Many of these planets have lined up and have similar orbits.  Like Pluto and Charon, many are more like co-planets than a main planet with moon(s).

"THE UNIVERSAL, BALANCED, INTEGRATED, EXTENSIVE, IRREFUTABLE, CLEAR, SIMPLE, AND TOP DOWN MATHEMATICAL PROOF THAT E=MC2 IS F=MA (ON BALANCE):

It is a very great truth that THE SELF represents, FORMS, and experiences a COMPREHENSIVE approximation of experience in general by combining conscious and unconscious experience.

What is gravity is an INTERACTION that cannot be shielded or blocked ON BALANCE. Great.

TIME dilation ULTIMATELY proves ON BALANCE that ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. INDEED, TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity ! Great. Accordingly, the rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Consider what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Consider what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON ON BALANCE !! Great. Consider the tides in relation to what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky ON BALANCE. HALF of the view of WHAT IS THE EARTH is BLUE (ON BALANCE) when the Pacific Ocean is then SEEN in full VIEW. 

E=MC2 IS F=ma. This NECESSARILY represents, INVOLVES, AND DESCRIBES what is possible/potential AND actual IN BALANCE, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE. Consider TIME AND time dilation ON BALANCE.

Energy has/involves GRAVITY, AND ENERGY has/involves inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE. ""Mass""/ENERGY involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE consistent with/as what is BALANCED electromagnetic/gravitational force/ENERGY, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. GRAVITATIONAL force/ENERGY IS proportional to (or BALANCED with/AS) inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity.

NOW, carefully consider what is THE MAN (AND THE EYE ON BALANCE) who is standing on what is THE EARTH/ground. Touch AND feeling BLEND, AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS gravity/acceleration involves BALANCED inertia/INERTIAL RESISTANCE; AS E=MC2 IS F=ma. Very carefully consider what is BALANCED BODILY/VISUAL EXPERIENCE. (LOOK up at what is the TRANSLUCENT AND BLUE sky, AS THE EARTH is ALSO BLUE.) CLEAR water comes from what is THE EYE ON BALANCE. Gravity AND ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy are linked AND BALANCED opposites, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS TIME is NECESSARILY possible/potential AND actual ON/IN BALANCE; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The stars AND PLANETS are POINTS in the night sky. The rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches the revolution. Great. It ALL CLEARLY makes perfect sense, AS BALANCE AND completeness go hand in hand. E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. Objects AND MEN fall at the SAME RATE (neglecting air resistance, of course), AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. The rotation of WHAT IS THE MOON matches it's revolution, AS E=MC2 IS F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. Consider what is THE EYE. So, LOOK at what is the fully illuminated (AND setting/WHITE) MOON AND what is the orange (AND setting) Sun ON BALANCE. Now, think about what is LAVA. E=MC2 IS F=ma. SO, we then multiply ONE HALF times one half in order to determine the size of the Moon. (It IS about one fourth the size of the Earth.) This is CONSISTENT with the fact that the Moon IS (on balance) LAND. Therefore, the density of THE SUN is (ON BALANCE) about ONE FOURTH of that of what is THE EARTH; AS E=MC2 IS then CLEARLY proven to be F=ma; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity. Very importantly, outer ""space"" involves full inertia; AND it is fully invisible AND black. Again, it all CLEARLY makes perfect sense ON BALANCE !!!

The BULK DENSITY of the Moon is comparable to that of (volcanic) basaltic LAVAS on the Earth. The energy density of LAVA IS about THREE TIMES that of water. SO, now, get a good and CLEAR LOOK at what is the ORANGE SUN !!! We WOULD then multiply ONE THIRD times one half in order to obtain the surface gravity that is experienced by the man on the Moon. (It IS one sixth of that of the man who is on the Earth.) The maria (""lunar seas"") on the Moon do take up ONE THIRD of what is the near side of the Moon. Excellent. The Moon is ALSO BLUE on balance. Great !!! Now, in conclusion, the land surface area of THE EARTH is 29 PERCENT; AND this is EXACTLY ON BALANCE WITH BOTH one third AND one fourth; AS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is gravity; AS E=MC2 IS CLEARLY AND NECESSARILY F=ma !!!!! GOT IT !!! GREAT.

E=MC2 IS CLEARLY F=ma ON BALANCE. ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy is CLEARLY proven to be gravity ON BALANCE. Gravity IS ELECTROMAGNETISM/energy. It must be, and it is.

Well Tabetha logically and scientifically excluded everything there.... except Aliens.

So I considered that, with some friends Ive discussed this with, and we excluded that possibility because there would have to be way too many people that didnt know each other and stood to gain nothing - involved in the hoax. Its just not viable. It could also of course be a phenomonen in the universe we havent yet discovered / understand - so we couldnt discount that either.  

But like Tabetha , we could not sucessfully exclude Aliens , so far as to say, we struggled to accpet that it would be, surely not!. One thing that is for certain, and we need to remember here is whatever is being observed happened just under 1500 years ago because this star is just under 1500 light years from earth. So , if there are Aliens and they had constructed a Dyson spehere and maybe theyd been looking at us thousands of years ago... perhaps they may have thought, lets go take a look. They'd surely have the tech to do so (worm hole tech etc) , and just maybe, they have.

"This could easily be explained by the fact that the star could have many planets around it at varying distances that, during the weeks or months of these unusual blips, were aligned in a way to create these unusual blips. A single blip could have been created by two or more planets partially lined up, of different sizes, of course being at different distances from the star. This would easily create the unsymmetrical blip the scientist was talking about. The beginning of the blip being formed by a, for example, very large planet, partially lined up with one or several planets of highly differing sizes that would contribute to the middle and end of the blip.  I find it odd that this solution is not even explored in the talk. It seems to me highly unlikely that a star system would only have a single planet.

Maybe, it requires extended period of observation to prove this.. But, just imagine even planets in our Solar system align every 1000 years in the same plane. 

If the star is young and the planetary system has just formed then they may be circling the star faster and hence might align more frequently.. but this is again just a theory like any other..",cant constellation planetary object consisting various size orbiting star roughly align earth line sight every year would say could different planet orbiting star might similar orbiting time cycle might align every year thus make light star dip appear like graph presented maybe requires extended period observation prove imagine even planet solar system align every year plane star young planetary system formed may circling star faster hence might align frequently theory like,1.0

"Why do we see stars !? A star is an omnidirectional emitter of coherent electromagnetic waves! In essence, we see a pillar of a ray of light! Everything is very simple! We see stars only because our Sun in our galaxy flies in sync with the rest of the stars! The distance between the stars is increasing, but it is so very - a slow process that lasts for millions of years. That is, an astronomer cannot observe the change in such long processes, since Earth time flies by with lightning speed! And so, now we know that distant stars are statically attached to one coordinate point in the sky, but why does the light of the stars travels so long distances, reaching our optic nerve? 1010
It's all about COHERENCE! The emitted light of the stars forms a kind of laser beam of light, in one of the radiation spectra such as X-rays this radiation is most effective. The rotation of the stars around their axis further enhances the coherence by pumping the beam. In fact, we see a column of a ray of light, but we see only that beam-column that flies in our direction, forming a peak - an energy point. In neighboring solar systems, people observe the phase radiation of the beam but several degrees to the side. The formed point in the sky confirms that the star is exactly in the place of its coordinates! if the Star could move relative to our Sun, then no coherent ray would be able to form.

"People who discount intelligent life in the Universe are degenerate bacteria, rather they are viruses that feed on humans and invoke fear in humanity so that people will give them money. Money that comes from trees, trees that give us life.

Those who are against space colonization and there being intelligent life in the Universe are demons. They want us to consume all of the trees on Earth through the persecution factor so that we will have less and less oxygen. The more religion persecutes people for their sins more money is needed to satisfy the consumption, meaning more trees are cut down.

Less oxygen means humans and life on Earth dies. When humans die the sentient ability to travel into space and conquer planets is a less of a threat or no threat at all to the demons of space.
In religious terms, this is the fight against the Anti-Christ, the Demons, Those From Beyond the Void. All of whom value nothing more than consuming all life on planet until the planet becomes desolate like Mars is.

Its not God's retribution, God does not rebuke Creation, its against the laws of the foundation of Creation to do so. It is an alien aspect of keeping humans on the Earth until we kill ourselves off completely to keep humanity from entering space to colonize it.....we are coming however, and this time....there won't be a Mars scenario to finalize the situation.

"What if the information given by the computers are telling us that this star is about to go supernova. I have researched a little about how stars show the first signs of going supernova. The core could be collapsing and the star could be producing pressure every so often which would cause the star to go super giant for a little bit of time and then go back to its regular state. This could happen over and over again to a star that is about to go supernova. When the star explodes into a red giant wouldn't it cause a dip like this in light. I don't think we have actually witnessed aliens yet. I believe this is a phenomena. If the star shows that it is definitely not young, it could be reaching its end and the star could go supernova. There are a few other stars in space that are burning up there hydrogen. The star will turn into a red giant and then go back to normal over and over again before the end of its cycle which would eventually lead to a supernova. If this star is extremely far away, it probably would appear that the star is going very dim drastically and then back to normal. The dimness would last a short period of time. This is like the phenomena of the star betelgeuse. I know in this case the computer that analyzed the data is looking for planets that would cause a dip in light around there host star, but this is just an idea of what could be causing this star to have it's very odd behavior.

Metal samples were presented to renowned scientist in the field and subjected to various metallurgical tests which concluded that it is an alloy that cannot originate on our planet.
In astrophysics, health, medicine, and other fields of study, many scientists have used and continue to use information previously published by Billy Meier to advance knowledge, obviously without citing the source from which their research originated. We admire the true scientists who are very successful but are still in the early stage because they do not consider the spiritual part that everything and also the matter has, this is because they have not yet found their spiritual part individually and until they find it will remain limited in knowledge, development, and research. Some scientists are beginning to realize this and the process has already begun and no government or religion can stop it, as it is naturally unstoppable, like an avalanche of snow that has already begun.
Why does Billy Meier only appear in low-level media as a fraudster, hoax, etc. and does not appear in the more reputable media nor is his name mentioned? Governments, religions, and people of power will lose their influence, in other words, they will be destroyed, there will be a rearrangement in society and the TRUE FREEDOM will emerge  TRUE FREEDOM that has been misunderstood through books and misconceptions and consequently misinterpreted by us because it simply never we tried it earlier.

the building blocks of life as we know it are abundant in the universe,  we exist as proof that life can just spring up out of those elements if the conditions are right, it is only scientists and the religious who continue to perpetuate the myth that we are special and that the chances for life on other planets are slim to none, this is a stupid stance to take and any scientist who would rather use a bad explination than just admit that alien life was a possibility should not call themselves a scientist, as a scientist it is their job to have an open mind and follow the evidence where ever it may lead and to accept a theory as possible until further evidence can discount or prove otherwise, to out of hand dismiss any possibility that can have just as much weight as another simply because it goes against the narrative that scientist have on alien life is a disgrace.


i do not know if aliens exist or not, i do not discount the possibility simply because we have yet to find any, it is of course possible that we will not find the kinds of signals we are looking for, because those signals have already past us by while we were not looking, it is just as possible that we may not see such signals for another thousand years, it is also possible that we will never see another civilisation like ours because their technological evolution went a different way, how different would our technology be today if tesla had won out over eddison, just how different would our signals into space look from what they are now? aliens might not use destructive or explosive energy like we do, they might have already discovered 0 point energy a million years ago, all these things are possible and should never be discounted out of hand and scorned at just because the word aliens is involved.",commented video decided add little building block life know abundant universe exist proof life spring element condition right scientist religious continue perpetuate myth special chance life planet slim none stupid stance take scientist would rather use bad explination admit alien life possibility call scientist scientist job open mind follow evidence ever may lead accept theory possible evidence discount prove otherwise hand dismiss possibility much weight another simply go narrative scientist alien life disgrace know alien exist discount possibility simply yet find course possible find kind signal looking signal already past u looking possible may see signal another thousand year also possible never see another civilisation like technological evolution went different way different would technology today tesla eddison different would signal space look alien might use destructive explosive energy like might already discovered point energy million year ago thing possible never discounted hand scorned word alien involved,1.0

"I love that Tabitha, herself, is presenting this amazing discovery they made concerning star ‚ÄúKIC -8462852‚Äù, now appropriately dubbed ‚ÄúTabby‚Äôs Star‚Äô! The bizarre structure that seems to surround the Tabby‚Äôs Star‚Äù is seen via Kepler, as it emanates this anomaly, which is what seems like SIGNIFICANT rotational dips in light, like one might see observing our star and say Jupiter‚Äôs rotation around it only on a far more MASSIVE scale, from the Cygnus constellation!  
What I found astonishing is also, get this...so far it appears that BOTH the Egyptian Pyramids and newly re-discovered Gobeckli Tepi, are aligned to this constellation!! 
Even ancient cave drawings and several ancient civilizations also make reference to the Cygnus constellation! 
What I‚Äôm wondering is ‚ÄúWho‚Äù came up with the Zodiacal names of these star systems??? How is it we refer to the Cygnus constellation as a flying bird, just as the very ancient did, which is encouraging because it tells us we still have this connection to our ancient past when it comes to the cosmos and our perception of them!  The fact that the ancients, who likely sought refuge in caves, etc., presumably after the last earth shattering catastrophe, also knew - even way back then of these associations, is encouraging! We are a species with amnesia but thankfully this doesn‚Äôt have to be a permanent state, I do believe we are waking up from the latest disaster created ‚ÄúComa‚Äù and are quickly regaining ground! While it baffles the mind that not only is a dyson  sphere observed, on KIC -8462852, there are also ‚Äúsignals‚Äù that appear to be broadcasting numerical equations corresponding to the number 11 and that also relate to the Great Pyramids,  Gobeckli Tepi, and itger ruuns such as Ba√†lbek/Heliopolis!

So far removed from where mainstream science is today, albeit, as we discover more and more ancient ruins, we are ever so slowly, digging in our philosophical heels, having to be dragged, resisting and kicking and screaming the whole way, towards our actual TRUTH, one that is far more incredible than we will ever subscribe to,  if we continue to stay embedded as we are now, in this limiting ‚ÄúNewtonian‚Äù hypothesis which promotes so much separation, randomness and dividing, we find ourselves spinning in circles and not really explaining bubkas!",love tabitha presenting amazing discovery made concerning star kic appropriately dubbed tabby star bizarre structure seems surround tabby star seen via kepler emanates anomaly seems like significant rotational dip light like one might see observing star say jupiter rotation around far massive scale cygnus constellation found astonishing also get thisso far appears egyptian pyramid newly rediscovered gobeckli tepi aligned constellation even ancient cave drawing several ancient civilization also make reference cygnus constellation im wondering came zodiacal name star system refer cygnus constellation flying bird ancient encouraging tell u still connection ancient past come cosmos perception fact ancient likely sought refuge cave etc presumably last earth shattering catastrophe also knew even way back association encouraging specie amnesia thankfully doesnt permanent state believe waking latest disaster created coma quickly regaining ground baffle mind dyson sphere observed kic also signal appear broadcasting numerical equation corresponding number also relate great pyramid gobeckli tepi itger ruuns balbekheliopolis come tabby youve programmed state alien word may say natural phenomenon vibrational emission scream alien intelligenty created structure wish mainstream science could wrap programmed mind around truth discovered merge hardcore science mindset inherent profound cosmically connected spirituality ancestor knew far cosmos far connected nature star understanding must work concert nature planet natural environment cosmos seem successfully merged spiritual scientific thus creating fascinating compelling hypothesis ever entangled inner connectedness school phenomenal thought far removed mainstream science today albeit discover ancient ruin ever slowly digging philosophical heel dragged resisting kicking screaming whole way towards actual truth one far incredible ever subscribe continue stay embedded limiting newtonian hypothesis promotes much separation randomness dividing find spinning circle really explaining bubkas,1.0

ATOMIC WAR PREDICTION ‚Äì MATT. 13V24-30 ‚Äì 14/05/2023.





¬†





Hi Brethren,





Facebook would not
allow my links because of the very Bitter Gospel Truth. So, if you want this
article in full, please visit my Youtube channel; nijjhar1. Search in Google,
Nijjhar, predictions.





¬†





The Bible has all the answers for the twice-born of the
holy spirit, ‚Äúcommon sense‚Äù or Surti.





¬†





‚ÄúCHOSEN PEOPLE‚Äù have the Keys
to this Secret: - Abram = Adam, Sarah = Eve and Promised Land = Garden of Eden.
‚ÄúAbraham‚Äù is the ‚ÄúFather of the Faithful‚Äù.





¬†





Watch my Youtube videos on Hajj for ‚ÄúThe Kingdom of
Heaven‚Äù:-





ISRAEL WAS ESTABLISHED ON 14/05/1948 + 70 YEARS OF
FULL PROTECTION TO MAY, 2018. Youtube Video: - 





¬†





Then, Real
Tribulations world had never seen before for FIVE years to May 2023 when ATOMIC
WAR COULD TAKE PLACE. Our Supernatural Father God (Elohim, Allah, ParBrahm,
etc.) knows better. 





Grim American
Jewish Reaper waving sickle to kill more in Venezuela as they did in Iraq,
Libya, Syria, Ukraine, etc.





¬†





REMEMBER THAT PROPHET ELIJAH, JOHN, THE BAPTIST CAME
TO LOOK AFTER THE CREATION OF DEMIURGE LORD YAHWEH, BRAHMA, KHUDA, ETC. FOR
REINCARNATION WHILST OUR ANOINTED ELDER BROTHER CHRIST JESUS DELIVERED US
GOSPEL OF OUR SUPERNATURAL FATHER FOR SONS OF ELOHIM, ALLAH, PARBRAHM, ETC. FOR
RESURRECTION. No raw brick, no baked brick; no born of water, no born of Allah.





KUDRATT KHUDAYE
DI (NATURAL CREATION FLESH + SOUL IS OF YAHWEH); NOOR BY GRACE IS OF ALLAH





(FLESH + SOUL +
HOLY SPIRIT, WHICH IS COMMON SENSE, SURTTI, ETC.)

What is the Gospel Truth?





¬†





Truths are of two
types; natural truth that applies to the physical nature of Yahweh, Brahma,
Khudah, etc., which is ‚Äúseen‚Äù by the two natural eyes and it is ‚Äúrelative‚Äù. The other is spiritual Truth, which is of our Supernatural
Father God (Elohim, Allah, ParBrahm, etc.) and as it is Light, NOOR, it is only
‚Äúperceived‚Äù by the Third eye of logical reasoning; no relativity applies to
this ‚ÄúAbsolute Truth‚Äù. 





¬†





Here is a video:-





¬†





Donald Trump would make Jews run for Israel to fulfil
Matt. 13v24-30, which Hilary couldn't.





¬†





Child-like Donald Trump
has pressed the Tribulations Button on 14/05/2018 by declaring Jerusalem to be
the Capital:-





Seven simple questions:-





1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What
is the difference between Yahweh, Brahma, Khudah, etc. and Elohim, Parbrahm,
Allah, etc.?





2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What
is the difference between a Priest and a Royal Priest?





3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why
Yahweh created Adam first and Eve out of the rib of Adam and not both together?





4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why a
woman cannot ‚Äúteach‚Äù the moral laws of Moses/Scriptures but she could ‚ÄúPreach‚Äù
Gospel?





5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Why
Jesus made a whip and beat the traders when He Preached that if someone hits
you on one cheek then present the other?





6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What
are the names of the Prodigal son, his elder brother and the father?





7.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† What
is the difference between the ‚Äúkingdom of heaven‚Äù of the Rabbis and the ‚ÄúRoyal
Kingdom of God‚Äù that Jesus ushered in?

"A debris field of two collided celestial bodies (two large solid planets now shattered into pieces) in an elliptical shape trapped orbiting the star would create such a light diminishing pattern. As far as the time period. The closer the object is to the sun, the longer it blocks light. The further the object, the shorter the duration. I don't feel like doing the math to give exact times and sizes, but you get the idea, and using some calculations you could recreate the hypothetical cloud of debris. So, two planets collided and created a large debris field around what remains of their cores so that gravity keeps them and their debris dancing around each other in a tight elliptical orbit (think rings of Saturn on a massive debris scale and angled in such a way as to create this light pattern to observers here). Highly plausible considering there's a high probability of many rogue planets drifting between solar systems, ejected by larger bodies in their host systems to drift alone through space until a sun draws them in (an event that may have very well occurred in our own solar system to give our current planetary alignments to the sun). If aliens were sufficiently advanced to build a structure so large, they'd be more likely to build a Dyson sphere and you wouldn't see the star at all because they'd be absorbing most of it's energy.",debris field two collided celestial body two large solid planet shattered piece elliptical shape trapped orbiting star would create light diminishing pattern far time period closer object sun longer block light object shorter duration dont feel like math give exact time size get idea using calculation could recreate hypothetical cloud debris two planet collided created large debris field around remains core gravity keep debris dancing around tight elliptical orbit think ring saturn massive debris scale angled way create light pattern observer highly plausible considering there high probability many rogue planet drifting solar system ejected larger body host system drift alone space sun draw event may well occurred solar system give current planetary alignment sun alien sufficiently advanced build structure large theyd likely build dyson sphere wouldnt see star theyd absorbing energy,1.0

This is why those stupid computers would miss them.

Large dust clouds would also cause asymmetric occlusions, like observed, and strike me as much more likely to be commonplace (at the astronomical scale).

"This ""mysterious"" light curve seems very straight forward to me.

Given the amount of possible objects within a solar system, collisions are common. So what if two large enough planets collided outside the light curves ""view"". The planets collide on opposite orbits slowing the orbit of both to a percentage of the greater mass planet's original orbital speed. This slows down the debris from the collision of the planets. Gravity attracts more and more mass to the slow moving field of debris and enlarges the area of light obscured by the debris. And overtime the debris disperses into an asteroid belt.

""The word""planet"" has meant many different things over the millennia and evenstill its definition is evolving.

The Greek term¬†asters planetai¬†mean ""wanderingstars"" and described the tiny lights that moved across the sky moredramatically than stars when compared over weeks and months. These wanderingstars, back then, amounted to Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn""

Copernicus was a shill for the accepted wisdom until his time was that the earth is flat. Meaning the is has a flatish surface with irregularities.

True science is coming out of a heavy shell and is unveiling the Truth. Some say that the earth is a sphere but not how we were taught. The lower hemisphere is solid with valleys full of water and the top hemisphere empty of solid matter but where the atmosphere resides and covered with a hard Dome glass like where the *Planetes* reside as shimmering stars and not hard bodies.

"All the stars and space itself is just an illusion. They are fake just like our world is. It‚Äôs all just a simulation. Did you know that a physicist named James Gates found computer codes embedded in the fabric of the universe? Also a experiment known as the ‚Äúdouble slit experiment‚Äù proved that matter only come into existence when there is a sentient observer!? More and more physicists are finding evidence indicating that reality is a simulation. So all this research of space is a waste of time. Instead of chasing after illusions; all the resources should be directed towards finding solutions to end the simulated experiences of human suffering caused by simulated diseases, warfare, poverty etc. Because, even if all the sufferings are just temporary simulated experiences; they experience itself is undeniable and therefore worth getting rid of. I think the test of man in here is to test a ment (test mankinds‚Äôs ment(al)) capacity. There was a Old Testament and now we are in a New Testament simulation. It is testing mankind‚Äôs mental capacity to find the solution to all the negative things that have been simulated for mankind to solve and re-enter the garden /paradise/ kingdom of Go0d. But unfortunately it seems that so far, mankind is failing because instead of working to regain the lost paradise; everybody is so busy trying to acquire gold/money. All nations and people are striving after gold because we believe that gold will buy us paradise. It‚Äôs like a woman who thinks you can buy heaven with gold sung about in ‚Äústairway to heaven‚Äù.

Why was a golden calf chosen instead of a full grown ox or a magnificent thing like a golden dragon or a majestic golden lion chosen to symbolize the idol? It‚Äôs Bc golden calf is an allegory describing gold/money. The number of livestock one possessed was the measure of wealth. Also a calf was chosen because just like a persons bank account or possessions; a calf can be fed and grown. An golden calf idol worship is a society where it‚Äôs peoples greatest goal is to grow their material wealth. A society where all the people constantly strive to feed and grow their bank accounts. I think this is a very accurate description of our world now wouldn‚Äôt you agree? Most evils in our world are caused by the desire to Cain/gain gold. What does the Bible tells us about the idolatrous people? They get destroyed! Why are people striving for money/gold? It‚Äôs not Bc people are inherently evil but it‚Äôs due to the helper created to help us live side by side. It‚Äôs Bc of the governments / social rules which make it impossible to adequately provide for yourself and your loved ones without having money. Because people‚Äôs love which makes them want to provide the best for their loved ones; they are forced into idolatry of worship the golden calf. The whole world‚Äôs Language is now United once more. The language of money. What happened to the world when the language was one and their building technology was greatly improved? It got destroyed.

TL:DR Final Conclusion = No Dyson Sphere, just a massive gas cloud.  ü§®ü§ì

*‚Äì News of January 9, 2018 ‚Äì*
Since September 2015, the Tabby star is subject to significant drops in brightness difficult to explain. Astronomers are accustomed to drops in brightness. When observing stars, the drops in luminosity are due, for example, to interactions with the atmosphere, or even to the planets that pass in front of their star. This is how planetary transits are located : they generate very low luminosity decreases, often less than 1%. But the observations of the Tabby star have shown that it can lose periodically up to 22% of its brightness.

Many hypotheses have been formulated to try to explain this phenomenon, including the possibility that the Tabby star is regularly obscured by artificial megastructures. The physicist Freeman Dyson had theorized this hypothesis in the early 1960s. According to him, a sufficiently advanced civilization would end up having energy needs of such a level that it should capture almost all the light emitted by its star. This would push this civilization to build gigantic structures surrounding its star.

The brightness declines of the Tabby star could have been due to a partial Dyson sphere or under construction. A team of astronomers led by Tabetha Boyajian, who made the original discovery, has just published a study on the cause of the phenomenon. This study was funded on Kickstarter : more than $ 100,000 was raised. The funds raised made it possible to observe KIC 8462852, the Tabby star, during 14 months. Four episodes of drop in brightness were observed. They are due to a gigantic cloud of dust. The new observation data show that the different colors of the light spectrum are blocked at varying intensities, which suggests that the body that blocks the light of this star is not opaque : it is at least partially transparent.

An extraterrestrial civilization around the Tabby star ?

*‚Äì News of May 23, 2017 ‚Äì*
The Tabby star, also called KIC 8462852, put the community of scientists in turmoil in September 2015 : we have observed very significant variations in brightness, inexplicable with our current knowledge. Indeed, the brightness of the Tabby star dropped very quickly in the space of a few days, before returning to a normal level.

Such a phenomenon has been reproducing since 19 May this year and astronomers are still unable to find a rational explanation for it. So much so that the hypothesis of a megastructure of extraterrestrial origin that would regularly obscure the star is seriously considered by scientists‚Ä¶

It could indeed be a sphere of Dyson. Freeman dyson, an American physicist and mathematician, said a very advanced extraterrestrial civilization would be able to build a structure that partially or completely surrounds its star in order to harvest all the energy it produces. Such a structure would be likely to explain the variations of light observed around the Tabby star, but we must of course remain skeptical of such an explanation. An unknown natural phenomenon could be at the origin of these variations, although for the moment all the attempts of natural explanations did not resist to the observations made of the Tabby star.",latest info tabby star kic january tldr final conclusion dyson sphere massive gas cloud news january since september tabby star subject significant drop brightness difficult explain astronomer accustomed drop brightness observing star drop luminosity due example interaction atmosphere even planet pas front star planetary transit located generate low luminosity decrease often less observation tabby star shown lose periodically brightness many hypothesis formulated try explain phenomenon including possibility tabby star regularly obscured artificial megastructures physicist freeman dyson theorized hypothesis early according sufficiently advanced civilization would end energy need level capture almost light emitted star would push civilization build gigantic structure surrounding star brightness decline tabby star could due partial dyson sphere construction team astronomer led tabetha boyajian made original discovery published study cause phenomenon study funded kickstarter raised fund raised made possible observe kic tabby star month four episode drop brightness observed due gigantic cloud dust new observation data show different color light spectrum blocked varying intensity suggests body block light star opaque least partially transparent extraterrestrial civilization around tabby star news may tabby star also called kic put community scientist turmoil september observed significant variation brightness inexplicable current knowledge indeed brightness tabby star dropped quickly space day returning normal level phenomenon reproducing since may year astronomer still unable find rational explanation much hypothesis megastructure extraterrestrial origin would regularly obscure star seriously considered scientist could indeed sphere dyson freeman dyson american physicist mathematician said advanced extraterrestrial civilization would able build structure partially completely surround star order harvest energy produce structure would likely explain variation light observed around tabby star must course remain skeptical explanation unknown natural phenomenon could origin variation although moment attempt natural explanation resist observation made tabby star,1.0

It is a bunch of space ROCKS(!),that have been pulled by that stars gravity field and in a specific place,there is a zone where these massive space rocks(not high-tech,whatever...),simply circle around this star,on regular and constant radius,something similar,but not,at the same time,is around Saturn.
There is many,many stars like that in cosmos,so,nothing,too exciting,Im afraid. 
So there you are,folks!Nothing to see people,go home,lets go,move it!...
Ta-da!The-end!
Oh,btw;How do I know that?! 
Well,a beautiful (almost forever),young girl named Swaruu,""told me"",in her own,this time,well worth watching ""little"",mind blowing show,that you will have to find yourself.No pain,no gain,right? 
But I have to warn you,if you find it!
After you see all those videos (if you can find them),at least 90%+ of people you know,will not call you any time soon,for a glass of vine or beer.
You will all be,almost certainly,excommunicated(!),but thats a small price to pay,for (hidden) knowledge,thats  waiting just for you to find it! 
Research a little bit yourself and youl see what a real,interesting things actually are/look like, ""up"" there.
I already said too much,but,what a heck,there it is folks!All at a reach of a housewifes old laptop.
I can promise you a ""ride of your life!"",if you find that girl,that I mentioned earlier.
Youl be amazed(!),what is REALLY(!) going on and,how brain washed we all are(not me ,of course : ) !
Thank you and good luck!Now you know!
I am Z.,from Croatia and Gosia(another BIG(!) clue...),is from Poland.
That is plenty of clues for average Joe/Jane.

"THE GREAT FALLING AWAY SPOKEN OF IN THE BIBLE
Those interested in the signs of the end times often take note of a warning given by Paul to the Thessalonians, speaking about the return of Jesus Christ to earth. He writes, ‚ÄúLet no one deceive you by any means; for that Day will not come unless the falling away comes first (2 Thessalonians 2:3). He then proceeds to explain this ‚Äúfalling away‚Äù in greater detail.
Paul writes that it will involve the revealing of ‚Äúthe man of sin‚Ä¶the son of perdition, who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped, so that he sits as God in the temple of God, showing himself that he is God‚Äù (2 Thessalonians 2:3-4). Some man is going to style himself as greater than God, pretending to be God‚Äîand people will believe him. 
Why? Because: HE IS THE GREATEST DECEIVER EVER. HE WILL COME TO EARTH AS AN ALIEN AND MAKE US BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE HIS DNA AND THAT WE ALL COME FROM IT. THE SEED OF CAINE SO TO SPEAK. THE GREAT FALLING AWAY WILL A CURE, MOSTLY BY SO CALLED BELIEVERS THAT NEVER REALLY DID. BUT HE WILL ALSO DECEIVE THE GREAT AND MIGHTY.

"Is the most mysterious star not in fact 93 million miles away? Have they considered that the star was switching on and off as the cosmic Birkeland currents that perhaps sustains all stars flipps back and forth from a third body in equilateral proximity electrically. Remember the Parker probe is resolving the dilemma of the corona being 300 times hotter than the surface. Perhaps stars are powered by invisible Birkeland currents which the electric model holds is the source of the power of our sun. Remember the only other place we see this phenomenon in the laboratory is when we have a body like the sun at a focal anode of matter in an electric field. This is how we make arch lights or plasma. Given the model of matter with massive spaces and infinitesmal ""solids"", massive relative electrical load differentials can exist between points in space without any local measurable effect.

"Good video!  I would like to share a pet peeve of mine,  if I may.  My statements do not necessarily apply to the presenter in this video. The ‚ÄúExtraordinary ‚Äú quote by Sagan is often inappropriately misused, overused and a favorite of those people who only want to contain all of the universe in the box (a three dimensional object) of their own personal paradigm.  This quote  is some people‚Äôs fancy way of saying,  you have to prove to me your experiences and knowledge in a way that fits my perception of what is ‚Äúreal‚Äù ‚Äî then I will  believe you.  Thinking/experiencing outside the box is, by its very definition ‚Äúextraordinary ‚Äú because it would entail four or more dimensional thinking. We cannot use a three dimensional litmus tests on something that does not abide by three dimensional laws just as the out of the box experiencer can‚Äôt prove anything to anyone who clings to using three dimensional tools to judge the validity of  the experience.  As a result, Sagan‚Äôs quote can refer to a challenge to prove previously unknown experiences in the three dimensional realm ‚Äî the box (or the cube of matter, as I like to call it üòâ).  The problem with Sagan‚Äôs quote is he doesn‚Äôt define his use of the word ‚Äúextraordinary ‚Äú.

"Regarding the ""swarm of comets"" hypothesis... I'm wondering if that's more likely than you would first think.

Consider just how congested we're coming to realise our own solar system is, with hundreds of thousands of objects swirling around in all sampled parts - that is, the inner system (just inside of Mercury to out beyond Mars), the already-known ""asteroid belt"" proper (most likely either the result of two planets that collided, or a protoplanet that never quite finished forming due to lack of mass - but leaving at least one identifiable Minor Planet behind in the form of Ceres), the outer system (just inside of Jupiter to roughly the orbit of Neptune), and then beyond through the Kuiper Belt (where Pluto, Eris, and their smaller Minor Planet siblings live, along with their moons, and countless smaller objects, out as far as Sedna), and maybe even the Oort Cloud (supposed origin of a lot of long-period comets) ... should it actually exist.

Although there has been some boost to the discovery rate made by radar-augmented astronomy (essentially, near-field radioastronomy using an active transmitter rather than simple passive reception), the majority of those objects have been discovered and tracked using a combination of the visible and infrared light they reflect from the sun - and therefore block from leaving the solar system - and their occlusions of brighter known stars and planets... essentially, full- or majority-width transits of the object of interest in front of another one whose motion is either much slower or effectively zero. Thus we see them both blocking light from other stars, and that of our own sun. And there's a lot of them. It's like grit swirling around the drain of a bathtub after an entire rugby team has washed off the mud of 80 rainy minutes' play in it, rather than a few lone balls of rock moseying their way around. Mass transit and occlusion is the norm, rather than a rare occurrence.

Now, the orbits of these objects, unlike the main planets, are at all kinds of inclinations relative to the sun, but the majority of them are within a certain limited range of angles from the main planetary plane. They also tend to form clusters and clumps, or have chains following the same general orbit, with particular object families being known, and especially there are relationships that fit the typical Lagrange point orientations, including clusters of asteroids that lead or follow the larger planets at their L3 and L4 points (L4 and L5? I keep forgetting).

It's already mentioned that the Kepler exoplanet search essentially relies on our being lucky enough to get a view of a star that just happens to be close enough to its main planetary orbital plane (like, probably within 1 degree, if not a whole lot less) that we get to see its planets transit in front of the stellar disc. What if, by some other sheer stroke of luck, and thanks to the great number of stars that are being observed, we were aligned nicely enough to catch a whole cluster of such minor planets, orbiting another star, interposing themselves between us and that star? And they were orbiting far enough out, like the outer reaches of our own Kuiper Belt or inner Oort Cloud (the transition point is a not inconsiderable fraction of a light-year), that their apparent motion vs the star was very slow, yet their size would also seem much larger, especially if it's not a particularly large star? The point made about planets not getting much larger than Jupiter is because once you exceed that by maybe 2x (which brings you to an area of maybe 400-500x Earth, but still not 1000x) the great mass of gas making up the planet gets compressed enough at the centre to start undergoing nuclear self-ignition... and then you've got yourself a small star.

Stick one of those at the centre of a system, and the components for another planet of almost the same size but not enough to selfignite, maybe composed of more solid elements but too widely distributed to form a single spherical mass (maybe down to some kind of other disruption), and you've got an irregular, clumpy cluster of material, a considerable fraction of the star's own size but looking larger due to being closer to us, orbiting it quite slowly due to the distance and the relatively weak gravity of the central element, and arrange it _just-so_ that we see it passing directly in front of the star rather than offset to either side (though, we haven't yet seen less than 85% of the normal light coming through, so it need not be entirely perfect), and you may well see the results we have here.

If the star is huge (like Betelgeuse or something) you might have more mass in form of planets and asteroids (or not because maybe huge stars are like still generation 1) but at the same time the dyson sphere has to be significantly larger. I don't think that a structure like this would be beneficial at all.

"Perhaps it is a gas giant with an abnormally dense cluster of moons that are the size of smaller planets like ours. And at great distances the entire planet/moon cluster acts as one giant light blocker. The various sizes of the moons could explain the asymmetry. I feel like if we are considering ET, my explanation could be just as probable. What about a debris field that is in a straight line, but perpendicular from the origin star? Like the hand on a clock, with the center of a clock being the star around which the hand rotates? When it aligns with us, we are staring longways into this debris field? This could explain the asymmetry as well. Then again, I'm not sure if this formation is possible, as matter seems to approach ring formations in a gravitational field over time. Lastly, yes dyson spheres are an interesting concept but I think there is another ET explanation that is equally, if not more likely to be the case. Imagine in our distant future, we decide to alter Venus in an attempt to make it habitable. Venus is ever so slightly outside the habitable zone and it's possible it simply needs to just cool down for several hundred years maybe more, to begin stabilizing the atmosphere. We then build a very large heat shield that regulates or deflects a fraction of the heat being absorbed by Venus.

"First of all space travel is fake. 2nd we really don't know what stars really are, but they are not big balls of gas burning millions of miles away. Our world is enclosed by a firmament/dome. The earth is a circular horizontal/flat plane. Everything we see is within the firmament dome. I think stars are small (1-3 miles in circumference) of vibrating circular balls of glowing gases like neon, perhaps with electrical energy in them such as static electricity. If the firmament is clear & we can see through it, perhaps the stars are outside in the water very close, maybe attached to the firmament. Another theory could be the stars are inside the firmament. I was told the firmament is made out of carbon, same material as a rough diamond, & perhaps the firmament spins & thats why we get star trails, or they are lights projected on to the firmament like a disco ball does to a wall, also if you notice when disco balls reflect objects onto a wall, ect because of the round shape of the disco ball the objects half way down the wall rotate the opposite way & upside down. I believe that is what we are seeing when we get near the outer edge of the world close to the ice ring circle they call Antartica. The earth is not a sphere of top & bottom, it is a circular flat disc of inside the tropic of cancer which is 1/4 from the very center of the arctic circle, the equator is the halfway point going out on the flat surface & the you have tropic of capricorn which is the 3/4 mark & the edge is where the firmament dome sits on the very edge of the world. This particular area, is off limits to human beings, because the government doesn't want the world model to match up to the biblical model, because the masses would then know, without any doubt that the heavenly father the creator exist. Science that is about space & space travel is is psuedo-science. It's basicly science fiction, for example the sphere world is tilted 23.4 degrees, so that when subtracted from a right angle of 90 degrees you get 66.6 which is the number of the beast/satan.

Kinda like our moon being able to block out the whole sun when observed from earth. 

It could also explain the irregular shape of the dip, since the light blocking planet is not in fact orbiting around the star that is being observed, so it could be passing in front of the star when it's on the edge of the orbit around its own star. It could be on its furthest point when moving in front of the star (and moving in the same direction as the observed star) and moving towards us and then be at its closest when it moves back out of the path of the star (moving in the opposite direction).

When you ""imagine"" something , that is the furthest you can possible get from science. I can imagine up a whole list of alternatives that are more plausible and disprove every hypothesis she had. It's like a child just learned division in math class and now tries to explain calculus to you when they have no clue what it is. But hey , they will make what  they observed fit into their limited base of knowledge and assume they know something. This is exactly what is wrong with 99.99% of the people in our world today. They are not dealing with reality and their imagination is not based in reality.

Look. If a ""species"" was so advanced that they could build a massive structure it would be idiotic to think they didn't have alternative sources of energy or power. No species in the Galaxy with the capability to build that structure would need to do so for energy. Feeble minds of this planet know about ""zero point energy"" and other sources. It hurts my head how delusional you have to be to think they needed to build a structure around a sun for energy.

Ok. What is wrong with her ""imagination""? 1. She does not know all the factors. 2, She does nothing to gather more factors. 3. She imagines possibilities that are not realistic on any level. 4. Thinks she is a scientist. 5. You never imagine what is happening without the fullest understanding of what is happening.

"My opinion is. That is a magnetic field creating the first mega-planet, as happened with Jupiter.

Many planets are not solid. They are putting the speculations in white or black options.

It is a magnetic mega-field similar to the conditions presented by Jupiter in its origin, composed naturally by concentrated energy that does not follow long, and without being too solid, nor to be considered matter. It is the beginning of a new planetary system around the Tabby star.

The magnetic field is much larger than the actual size of the mega-planet will be, but the whole force is centered on a vorterix with a nucleus where the highest luminous drop is seen periodically. All the strength of what will become a new planetary system.

The magnetic capacity of the future mega-planet alters the wave of light. But the planet in appearance will be spherical.

In the normal luminicity of the star the data shows constant ascents and descents. Part of the normal life rhythm. Although at its birth explosion, the star has removed much matter from its environment. And that's why it is not appreciated in the dust environment but yes other elements. The magnetic field is capturing everything that accidentally enters to the region to transform it into a gaseous or solid future.

The effect is similar to a black hole that is getting bigger. It is likely to compensate for feeding by capturing matter.

As it begins to feed its mass of more nearby matter, it produces a greater effect as seen in the progress of the sample.

It is the same thing that happened with Jupiter in the beginnings of our solar system.

Probably from a distance, this singular effect in the light sample can be seen in the environment of young stars whose planetary system is still in formation and there is a magnetic field in its surroundings beginning to form a first planet. Axis of the future planetary system.

It's interesting.

"what really troubles me was something this lady said in the beginning about the kepler project recording observations every 30 minutes...if the recording was CONTINUOUS the scientists would not have to rely on multiple FRAMES-EVENTS and interpolation  they would get the actual picture of the transition and things would definitely be more smooth and detailed on these graphs...of course the downlink wouldn't be able to handle this kind of load so...OK... 

the second troubling thing is the alarming inefficiency of the algorithms used to recognize the wanted patterns...if the people involved in the project initially, KNEW they had to look for outside help to identify events then something MUST have gone wrong with the projects pattern recognition algorithms and the coordinators knew about it and they also chose not to make it better for the scope of the particular kepler project...well...this is unacceptable...    

now about the weird data...i would have to say that my first hunch would be a planetary body passing in front of the star along with its SATELLITE and that would probably at least explain the asymmetry of the event pattern...  my second guess would have to be a planetary body of irregular non spherical shape... my third guess would have to be a planetary body passing in front of the star and COINCIDING with another planetary body on a different orbit which is a slim chance but still worth putting on the table...then the multiple weird event would have to be a complex planetary body like saturn...

however i'm not an astronomer...i have no idea if a planetary system can run such slow orbits so that planets passing in front of the star may explain the data !!!!!!

then the scientists would have to rule out a source from outside the solar system...i'm sure astronomers will be quite sure that they have mapped pretty much everything but the galaxy is a big place with constant motion and catastrophic events...it is possible that maybe something passed through or near that solar system that went unnoticed by our observatories like an asteroid field or something...who knows...maybe now with the new supercomputers that are coming we'll be able to do a much better job at watching the skies...unless they botch the job like they did with the kepler mission...two catastrophic failures in the targeting machinery...for the love of god...

It is possible that we human beings, on this speck of dust in the universe, are the very first advanced species to have sprung forth, however it is just as possible that we are not, given our chemistry, the basic building blocks of life on this planet, is almost one for one in the most common elements in the universe, plus as we are carbon based life forms, now carbon is the most fruitful element in the universe, you can make more from carbon than you can from every other element on the periodic table combined, so it makes sense we would be carbon based especially given how common it is in the universe, in fact it's the most common, it is just as likely that there is other intelligent life in the universe, with that in mind, I find it hard to understand why so many scientists mock the idea or possibility. Surely just because we have yet to find any does not mean that some exist, maybe they are not as advanced as us, maybe right now on some planet, an alien life form has just discovered how to make fire, maybe somewhere, alien life started millions of years before we did and they got wiped out, or maybe they didn't and are just very careful about allowing signs of their existence to leak out from their home, maybe the radio evidence so many look for past us by 1 or 2 thousand years ago.

Now i assume that there isn't a object as massive as a black-hole in the area and that you would have seen the fluctuation of the stars movement if that was the case the likely hood of a Alien mega structure is abysmal even if you look at a billion stars, not only will bacteria have to be common, but also Intellect will have to be common, the chances that a planet is in a stable orbit around a sun that has intellectual life that then advances technology for long enough to leave their planet and make autonomous replicating  robots to create mega-structures around their sun to capture energy sounds unlikely not only because how bad energy transfers over distance but also because creating a basically limitless source of energy from fusion should by then be possible for the aliens not forgetting that they could literally find other planets/asteroids to get enough resources to get more energy leaving you with a basically limitless supply of energy before you start harvesting the sun. and all this will have to happen at the SAMETIME that we are alive, and at the SAMETIME that we are looking at stars, i find this beyond unlikely its idiotic to even mention it as a possible reason with the data provided. if i where to make a Dyson sphere would use the natural cloud of a star as the starting point, this would store the energy as it would supply me with a lot of materials for building and it, having no ""dust"" around it seems to me enough of a reason that there is not aliens, and yes i realize that the dust would ""settle"" at some point but the time this taks its likely that they would have sendt more autonomous robots to more stars to make more Dyson spheres around neighboring stars since the time it would take to make this is MASSIVE having it ready for your next set of colonists would be a logical step, even if they have a lot of space left around that specific star having a backup colony to go to would be obvious. its like we are already looking at mars and talking about Terra forming it. you have to start long before you need it. and also if we can see their sun and they have lived long enough to make a Dyson sphere around their sun i can already 100% grantee you that they have send t satellites giving data from the closest million stars and since we have seen no such thing i even more doubt the Aliens theory (unless its already crashed and burned on earth sprouting the life we have here).",another solar system front star lot closer doesnt ignited sun mean common reason data would show isnt even related specific solar system looking first thing thought planet crashed happened recently kept colliding stuff moved might cool anything hot enough give light signature orbit beeing obstructed something unstable orbit around sun keep changing position object go around sun stable orbit doesnt mean every star thing change large planet loses orbit move everything else around quite possible orbit get fucked easy orbit track might new class planet basically gravitational cluster large derby orbiting making weird pattern option assume isnt object massive blackhole area would seen fluctuation star movement case likely hood alien mega structure abysmal even look billion star bacteria common also intellect common chance planet stable orbit around sun intellectual life advance technology long enough leave planet make autonomous replicating robot create megastructures around sun capture energy sound unlikely bad energy transfer distance also creating basically limitless source energy fusion possible alien forgetting could literally find planetsasteroids get enough resource get energy leaving basically limitless supply energy start harvesting sun happen sametime alive sametime looking star find beyond unlikely idiotic even mention possible reason data provided make dyson sphere would use natural cloud star starting point would store energy would supply lot material building dust around seems enough reason alien yes realize dust would settle point time taks likely would sendt autonomous robot star make dyson sphere around neighboring star since time would take make massive ready next set colonist would logical step even lot space left around specific star backup colony go would obvious like already looking mar talking terra forming start long need also see sun lived long enough make dyson sphere around sun already grantee send satellite giving data closest million star since seen thing even doubt alien theory unless already crashed burned earth sprouting life,1.0

It is obvious that there are beings on the same level or more evolved

Let us place a Hydrogen atom on a scale compared to the size of a football stadium.
Can you see the size of the proton at its center?
Now imagine that the electron, of course, in its orbit around the proton, would be the boundary of the stage.
In the case of atoms this distance will always be respected.
I think other living beings in our galaxy have emerged in the galaxy to respect a law of nature as the distance relationship between the proton and its electron.
Maybe so that they do not annihilate one another, however once they evolve, maybe they find a way to communicate! Following the example of the atoms,
two species formed an intelligent molecule, until it completes its complexity and we have something like us in the cosmos.
However, and quite curious, the immensity of the universe and in fact we are stuck in the earth, for some reason there is this limitation for beings with our emotional and intelligent capacity.

It means that there is a drastic distinction between the different phases of the lunar interior ‚Äì that the interior is quite different from what we have seen on the surface."" Mikhail Vasin, Alexander Shcherbakov, Societ Academy of Sciences, 1970. ""Is the moon a creation of an alien intelligence?"" Dr Harold Urey, Nobel Prize for Chemistry ""I‚Äôm terribly puzzled by the rocks from the Moon and in particular of their titanium content."" Dr S Ross Taylor, Geochemist of lunar chemical analysis, Said the problem was that maria plains the size of Texas had to be covered with melted rock containing fluid titanium. He said you would not expect titanium ever to be hot enough to do that, even on Earth, and no one has ever suggested that the Moon was hotter than the Earth. ""What could distribute titanium in this way? Highly advanced technology developed and operated by entities that are immensely more technologically advance than humans.""

"Hadn't really thought about it, but if the size of the pieces of a potential Dyson Sphere are greater than 239 k miles across (distance from Earth to Moon), those pieces would either have to be incredibly thin, or there wouldn't be enough matter orbiting KIC 846, or any star for that matter, for the raw materials to built a Dyson Sphere that could block such a high percentage of stellar light as observed from KIC 846.

"I don't believe you can assume size based on the dip.. Perspective is everything. For example, if we have a 100 * SOL star somewhere out there, and a gas giant or other large planet which developed far enough out.. there is the possibility of¬†massive amounts of light being blocked.. 

There are so many variables.. You could be looking at a light refractory pattern from a comet, or from a planetary ring system, how about interference from an exoplanet, it could also be the curve of a post two planetary collision before the planet, and possible new moon, has begun to reform back into a spherical shape, or how about inclination with two bodies appearing on a single blip.... It could also be from light passing through a large enough atmosphere or an air / light-gas giant. Additionally, it could simply be a body on an elliptical orbit giving longer times and more light-blocking ability as it gets closer to us.

There are so many possible explanations of why the curves don't appear uniform - it could very well be the sun itself. We live in a universe far stranger than many can even begin to speculate about...

I have only seen the first minutes and I'll continue watching shortly.

Edit: You're right - a collision, in most cases, would produce a lot of dust and create a frosted-lightbulb quality... If a collision took place, and both bodies were comprised of mostly water, it could produce the effect of tens of thousands of chunks plus evaporating trails. Solid-water-comets!

As for an alien society, they would've likely reproduced what occurs in nature for energy as we are currently doing with leaf-structures to repel liquids, etc... Also, for your alien idea.. for them to build these structures - it'd probably be on a similar footing of the pyramids - they did it because they could, even though the pyramids had a purpose, a lot of structures being built are being built simply because we can and because it is a marvel to our ingenuity...



I'm leaning towards some of my other ideas, such as inclination with various bodies, and possibly rings or breached-rings rings, causing the dips... Imagine what Jupiter or Saturn their many satellites would look like as it enters to block and larger moons orbiting in and out of the light until the large dip.... I'd see similar readings from light passing through thinner / broken ring systems on top of a high number of natural satellites when running a thought-simulation.

And we still can't discount involvement from other bodies in the way ( gravitational lensing rerouting light through other systems, exoplanets, asteroid belts or rings, etc.. before arriving here )...

But it could by a Dyson Swarm. If this is a society capable of generating power from their entire solar system they would likely be aware of the problems with heat.

Some difference in temperature. This would effectively result in an even distribution of energy in such a way that it could come across as no different than the heat that would ordinarily be released by the Star.

"Nice speech, to much phantasy. Lets do this with logic. Firstly the facts: Something is blocking the light of that star, meaning something is between us and that star. We also know that its not spherical and the mass of that matter is changing. We know the star is to old to be in the part of its life where it would be starting to form planets. Now what we can exclude what it is: a sphere, even if its called Dyson Sphere. Because spheres when they circle or things made by intelligent lifeforms would not be that irregular. They would more like show a pattern. Also we have a lot of material but not so dense or in a mass that it could ignite into fusion. Otherwise we would see it glow. Just so you know: Jupiter who would block 1% of OUR star just needs 80% more if its mass to ignite into fusion. This material blocks 2000% if the sunlight that Jupiter blocks. If it would be one combined natural occurring object, it would ignite or at least glow. That concludes that there are in fact more than one object. The question that remains is: what is it? Here we could go to the objects we know and simply compare. There is many kinds of material in space and its all part of a lifecycle somehow. Big objects that have the density like the stuff in question and also come in such volume usually form planets or suns. But it could also be something close to that that got destroyed. What I#m talking about is that most likely we have some material that was a sun / planets before and got broken up by some force in many parts. Could be by the star that we see the light blocked off, could be by something that passed by. What supports that theory: most suns come as a pair. It could be the second star that was maybe smaller and was hit by something big enough to burst it into parts. The parts would stop fusion because they are to small, have not enough gravity to be dense enough to create that kind of heat. Now... if this stuff is floating around that sun it would align in a dish. Maybe there is also one big part (former core) that pulls on the other material and doesn't allow it to spread very far. The movement of that material would be irregular and explain the ""shapes"" in the diagram. Also what we saw in the diagram could be more than one object, just objects in different size. Because most of our outer planets (with that mass it has to be a wide orbit around the sun to not fall in it) take many years to circle around the sun once.

"Here's a fun thought: It's all about perspective, right? For example, our moon, a tiny wisp of a thing compared to our star, can block 90% starlight from the perspective of the planet bound life between the Moon and the Earth. The rays cast by KIC8462852 could be dis-proportionally intersected in a similar way if we observed objects in transit in interstellar space, say outside KIC's heliosphere, but not close enough to us to disrupt starlight of surrounding stars. Additionally, the asymmetrical curves suggest either thrust applied in the trajectory (aliens), or a non-spherical object which was on a trajectory near enough to our angle of observation to present a slow ""sunset"" in the example curve given at first, while its cliff like other edge didn't obscure the light nearly in the same way. So, we're looking at an interstellar debris field, (explaining the 20% drop), or an interstellar transit or trade route, through which ships of varying sizes transit far enough from KIC to have exaggerated shadows, with sufficient course-adjustment to suddenly move out of the stellar transit to Earth in abrupt fashion once they are far enough from the heliosphere. So - could this be supernova remains of an asteroid field, where interstellar history would be necessary to explain the planetary debris? or could it be a new race, capable of interstellar stations parked outside their home star's heliosphere, and we just happen to be positioned on the other side of one of their colonized worlds and their interstellar port?? Is there enough data to run some model examples of an object at some distance from the star, from our vantage point?

If it was build directly around the sun, then the curvatures would be permanently because it would be build directly around the sun. It have to be something NOT directly around the sun, because they have seen very long periods of calmth and no lightcurves. IF this story is real, we need to discover what it is indeed.

Maybe there is something more closer then it looks like, because they talk about the megastructure. How would they build something like that big? Maybe it is a smaller structure closer to earth then we know. It's moving anyway but we don't know where it's moving exactly. The curves come with periods, the curvatures are not permanently present.

Or maybe it is a planet with many rings in all directions, wobbling around that area without 1 correct orbit? Maybe we discover a new kind of planet were many rings around the planet are strong enough to disturb its correct orbit?

"OK, I've been following this since the story got out, and I have had plenty of time to think about it. I watched this video about two months ago now. Here I will focus on one statement she made: When something absorbs large amounts of energy for whatever purpose, ""it cannot defy the laws of physics!"" So if this is a mega structure, we should be seeing waste heat energy.

Well I would have to disagree! Here's why:
1. Such a civilization that has the ability to build such a structure would by definition be far more advanced than we currently are. Yes she did say this, and I am in agreement with that part of what she said.
2. If this is an advanced civilization able to build a Dyson Sphere or Swarm, as the case may be, then it is not inconceivable to think that they may have developed the ability to capture the waste heat from their operations and channel it back into a consumable form. This would of course possibly be able to make use of 100% of all collected energy from the star; either in its original form, or in converted forms. Of course it may not be 100% efficient, but such an advanced civilization could still use almost all of it, at least 99.9% or more, so that any waste heat that escapes would not be detectable from our viewpoint.

Right here on Earth we are seeing the beginnings of such technology already. There are new automobiles that can recycle some of the energy they get from the driving energy to run on-board systems. Really this is a step in the right direction for technology on our planet, given the cost of energy in whatever form we choose to use. So if we already have something that is moving us in this direction, why would we assume that a more advanced civilization had not developed such technology and advanced it to the level of almost no waste energy being lost?

I'm not saying this is actually what is happening with this star, but it is far more likely than the comet swarm hypothesis. What I am saying is do not count the alien civilization scenario out just yet. As our observation technology continues to advance, we will be able to resolve more and more of what is out there hundreds and thousands of light-years from us. Soon we will likely be able to look at this star with an instrument that can show enough detail to actually determine what it is that is causing these extreme light curve dips. Then we can put the mystery to rest.",ok ive following since story got plenty time think watched video two month ago focus one statement made something absorbs large amount energy whatever purpose defy law physic mega structure seeing waste heat energy well would disagree here civilization ability build structure would definition far advanced currently yes say agreement part said advanced civilization able build dyson sphere swarm case may inconceivable think may developed ability capture waste heat operation channel back consumable form would course possibly able make use collected energy star either original form converted form course may efficient advanced civilization could still use almost least waste heat escape would detectable viewpoint right earth seeing beginning technology already new automobile recycle energy get driving energy run onboard system really step right direction technology planet given cost energy whatever form choose use already something moving u direction would assume advanced civilization developed technology advanced level almost waste energy lost im saying actually happening star far likely comet swarm hypothesis saying count alien civilization scenario yet observation technology continues advance able resolve hundred thousand lightyears u soon likely able look star instrument show enough detail actually determine causing extreme light curve dip put mystery rest,1.0

"One cannot measure distances of greater than about 25 light-years using parallax since we don't know EXACTLY where (not only does the Earth go around the sun, the sun orbits the galactic center, etc. so determining exactly where Earth was 180 days ago is all the more difficult) the Earth was sixth months ago using the Earth's ORBIT around the sun as the base of the triangle.

If u think Red Shift measures/accurately gauges distances 2 distant objects, u need 2 know that red shift is QUANTIZED (only at certain energy levels), absolutely ruling out the Dopper Effect explanation, may b caused by tired light, (Light may lose energy naturally as it travels and remember that since light has mass, it is affected by other objects with mass. A solar sail works because light has momentum and therefore mass. If you believe light has energy, and energy is mass according to Einstein, then you believe light has mass.) objects moving @ right angles to us, & when gravity is acting on an object. There's this object moving TOWARDS us that is still red-shifted!!! There's this pair of objects connected with radically different redshifts that proves the big bang wrong. In addition, in the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, near the center, where the velocities are extremely high, the red-shift is somehow washed out. This strongly implies that strong motion DESTROYS the redshift, instead of creating it. A galaxy has even been measured to have a DECREASE of one quantization in redshift, which should be impossible if the universe is expanding and the redshift is due to the doppler effect.

"One of the statements in this video article is that energy collectors in a Dyson Sphere would produce waste heat that our instruments could detect. I however do not think so! Why? Because a civilization that is advanced enough to build such a structure would obviously also be advanced enough to put any waste heat produced in this way to work for them. If it had become necessary to build a structure like this to maximize the amount of energy collected, it stands to reason that they would want to capture all the energy and put it to use, thereby preventing any kind of waste above a tiny fraction of a percent.

There is precedence for this theory being the case. Right here on Earth right now, we are developing such technology that takes waste heat from energy usage and puts it back into the system to increase the efficiency of energy use. So it is no stretch of the imagination to consider that this might be what is happening with this most definitely interesting star. In truth, it would seem to me that this is even more plausible that the comet cloud or asteroid cloud theory. Such clouds orbiting a star would want to reach an equilibrium in which they would form a ring, like the asteroid belt of our Solar System, or the rings of all the gas giant planets in the Solar System. What are the chances that such a cloud would have formed in the time period that allows the Kepler Telescope to detect it? I say billions if not trillions to one! But if a Dyson Sphere is the truth of this, the chances of it being in existence during the time of that Kepler mission would actually be far greater. I would not hazard a guess as to what the chances are, but I will say  that such a structure would be more likely to remain in existence for a much longer period of time than comet or asteroid clouds that act like this. Plus those types of clouds would be giving off detectable heat in the form of reradiated energy after being warmed by the star. As there is no significantly detectable heat, it must be something else.

Now I'm not saying that a Dyson Sphere is actually what this is; just that we should not count it out! We may be looking at the best evidence of Extra-Solar life ever found, so that avenue should not be abandoned until such time that there is proof positive that this could not be what this is. Every test we can develop that may help us learn whether this is such evidence must be implemented in order to see what the outcome will be.",one statement video article energy collector dyson sphere would produce waste heat instrument could detect however think civilization advanced enough build structure would obviously also advanced enough put waste heat produced way work become necessary build structure like maximize amount energy collected stand reason would want capture energy put use thereby preventing kind waste tiny fraction percent precedence theory case right earth right developing technology take waste heat energy usage put back system increase efficiency energy use stretch imagination consider might happening definitely interesting star truth would seem even plausible comet cloud asteroid cloud theory cloud orbiting star would want reach equilibrium would form ring like asteroid belt solar system ring gas giant planet solar system chance cloud would formed time period allows kepler telescope detect say billion trillion one dyson sphere truth chance existence time kepler mission would actually far greater would hazard guess chance say structure would likely remain existence much longer period time comet asteroid cloud act like plus type cloud would giving detectable heat form reradiated energy warmed star significantly detectable heat must something else im saying dyson sphere actually count may looking best evidence extrasolar life ever found avenue abandoned time proof positive could every test develop may help u learn whether evidence must implemented order see outcome,1.0

"This woman is illogical if she believes that the statement ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" is true. If this statement were true, then we would never be able to believe any extraordinarily improbable events to have occurred as reported, even when we have actual evidence that such events have indeed occurred. 

For Example: The winning sequence of lottery numbers as reported by the Evening News. The Evening News claiming that this particular sequence of lottery numbers is the winning sequence is quite an extraordinary claim. This is because the probability of the event -- the particular sequence of lottery numbers -- has odds that are millions to one. If the Evening News must have extraordinary evidence in order for our belief in the what the Evening News has reported/claimed to be justified, then we would never be able to trust the Evening News. The requirement to provide extraordinary evidence would never be met by the Evening News. But on the contrary, we believe the Evening News' claim. Why is this? 

Well, for one, by the simple evidence of a video recording that shows the winning sequence being generated. And such a video recording is not ""extraordinary evidence"". Thus, the statement ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence"" is demonstrably false. 

This woman's type of illogical ""Saganized"" thinking would lead to sketicism to all sorts of highly improbable events, and should be thrown on the ground like The Lonely Island. 

Rather, when determining whether or not an extraordinary claim is true, what is more important is to ask this: 
How likely would the evidence be realized/reported, if the event had NOT occurred? 

Back to our example: How likely is it that the Evening News would announce a particular sequence of lottery numbers, if that WASN'T the actual winning sequence? 
If it is unlikely that the Evening News would do this, then we can have good reason to believe that the particular sequence of lottery numbers reported is indeed true, WITHOUT such a need for any extraordinary evidence. We don't even require a video recording, we just take the Evening News' word for it, going on the reliability of their testimony.",woman illogical belief statement extraordinary claim require extraordinary evidence true statement true would never able believe extraordinarily improbable event occurred reported even actual evidence event indeed occurred example winning sequence lottery number reported evening news evening news claiming particular sequence lottery number winning sequence quite extraordinary claim probability event particular sequence lottery number odds million one evening news must extraordinary evidence order belief evening news reportedclaimed justified would never able trust evening news requirement provide extraordinary evidence would never met evening news contrary believe evening news claim well one simple evidence video recording show winning sequence generated video recording extraordinary evidence thus statement extraordinary claim require extraordinary evidence demonstrably false woman type illogical saganized thinking would lead sketicism sort highly improbable event thrown ground like lonely island rather determining whether extraordinary claim true important ask likely would evidence realizedreported event occurred back example likely evening news would announce particular sequence lottery number wasnt actual winning sequence unlikely evening news would good reason believe particular sequence lottery number reported indeed true without need extraordinary evidence dont even require video recording take evening news word going reliability testimony,1.0

She mentioned that a planet the size of Jupiter would have a dimming effect of about 1%, but i'm pretty sure that if Jupiter actually got in the way, it would have a dimming effect of probably 100%, because it's closer. With such a narrow perspective of each star and no ability to see the objects making the change in brightness, why would the assumption be (when the dimming is irregular) that it isn't just an unknown set of independent smaller objects that happen to be closer than the expected distances of orbiting planets. Also, if these objects aren't moving in circles around the star, but were heading away or towards the star, that could account for the increased duration. The quote at the beginning was also odd, since it really did sound like a claim was being made, but no evidence (that might validate that claim) was ever presented.
