"Crisper will introduce something we don't want.   Sorry.   The introduction of what we have been seeing over the last 2 years is an attempt to control society on a grand scale. The individuals that are supposedly controlling everything that happens have a plan to regulate everything.  Mostly, how we function daily. Period.  
How?
Well, something has been introduced into us that we ran to recently because of a scare.  Ask yourself what was it?  Well, it shut down everything under the guise of health emergency people.  Why did they do this?  To control:
Population.
Banking
Health
Policing.  and even worship.
It will even recognize YOUR THOUGHT PROCESS!! 
Remember the Tom Cruise movie?  Minority Report?  
China has already pushed forward with the credit system that recognizes you at a drop of a hat!

I've seen the real thing done in a lab.  Anyone with 5 minutes of training can do it.  It's in silica.  So if you like to spin cells add a caustic element run a PCR amplification and then in silica show the procedure done go for it.  But it amounts to nothing.  It's literally imaginary.  Go ahead and be amazed by explanations and animations but watch it done in the lab.  And tell me you believe it after that.

"Sounds great but just think if we would have never started experimenting with humans, animals and our food we wouldn't have to search for a cure for diseases or altering DNA. Most diseases are man made, civilization has created their own issues. Greed has created most of our difficulties. Altering DNA will only create more problems as it has in the past. Instead of creating new diseases and focusing on creating new ones why don't we go back to the natural order of things. We have enough land and resources if used correctly to sustain humanity. Just as we are using science and technology in unknown ways to advance civilization soon technology will takeover and everything will be computerized. This will limit human creativity in every way.If you think you're bored now wait until the computers take over.",sound great think would never started experimenting human animal food wouldnt search cure disease altering dna disease man made civilization created issue greed created difficulty altering dna create problem past instead creating new disease focusing creating new one dont go back natural order thing enough land resource used correctly sustain humanity using science technology unknown way advance civilization soon technology takeover everything computerized limit human creativity every wayif think youre bored wait computer take,1.0
"So I've just watched half a dozen videos on CRISPR, including this one, and none of them explain how the system can enter every singe cell in a living organism. All the videos (including this one) only explain it once you get the CRISPR/CAS9 into a single cell. How do you get it into a single cell to begin with? And how do you get it into EVERY SINGLE CELL inside a living organism? Can someone explain this?
