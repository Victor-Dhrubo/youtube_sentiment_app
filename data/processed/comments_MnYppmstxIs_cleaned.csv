"Crisper will introduce something we don't want.   Sorry.   The introduction of what we have been seeing over the last 2 years is an attempt to control society on a grand scale.

How?
Well, something has been introduced into us that we ran to recently because of a scare.  Ask yourself what was it?  Well, it shut down everything under the guise of health emergency people.  Why did they do this?  To control:
Population.
Banking
Health
Policing.  and even worship.

I bacteria genetics are not contained in a nucleus how do they have memory??,bacteria genetics contained nucleus memory
"Regarding the 2m48s mark on CAS1, it seems if the cell can detect the invader  (i.e. no previous dna history), and still neutralize it, why does it need to save a dna (vaccination-card) record of it?   

I get the cas9 is just the scissors, and must be combined with the ""chimera"" guide gRNA.   But if the gRNA is composed of the CRISPR crRNA (the spacer segment to match)  +  the tracrRNA is what *HOLDS* the crRNA in place..  What moves this RNA complex to the desired spot?  And what is the bacteria's version of the ""chimera"" tracrRNA?  


And if you have a single-gene disorder, ex. Huntington's, and assuming you draw White-Blood-Cells, inject with a plasmid of CC5/CAS9, and incubate until you grow enough modified cells under the hood, how is this CAS9/CRISPR complex delivered (as to avoid the human immune system)?   Is it injected to a specific tissue, into the bone marrow, into an egg/sperm?  For example, often mentioned is the off-target danger of Gene Therapy for cancer.. and how modified viruses can insert themselves into any part of the chromosome, rather than the gene of interest... does CRISPR have this concern?  What percentage of cells, over which tissues would need to be altered in order to prevent the disease?  


Also, why isn't silencing the gene expression preferable?   Similarly, after the cut, if you insert your own genetic material, how do you know if this segment will get expressed?  And if making a gene edit still requires another mechanism on top to express it, how does this compare with epigenetics, RNAi/RISC complex?

Finally, on the Bio Eats World podcast, Dr. Jennifer Doudna describes how pre-Cas9,  the utility of CRISPR proteins that can target RNA for cutting wasn't very exciting (19m30s), why?   See also the Life Scientific podcast (9/19/17 16m mark).",regarding m mark ca seems cell detect invader ie previous dna history still neutralize need save dna vaccinationcard record get ca scissors must combined chimera guide grna grna composed crispr crrna spacer segment match tracrrna hold crrna place move rna complex desired spot bacteria version chimera tracrrna singlegene disorder ex huntington assuming draw whitebloodcells inject plasmid cccas incubate grow enough modified cell hood cascrispr complex delivered avoid human immune system injected specific tissue bone marrow eggsperm example often mentioned offtarget danger gene therapy cancer modified virus insert part chromosome rather gene interest crispr concern percentage cell tissue would need altered order prevent disease also isnt silencing gene expression preferable similarly cut insert genetic material know segment get expressed making gene edit still requires another mechanism top express compare epigenetics rnairisc complex finally bio eats world podcast dr jennifer doudna describes precas utility crispr protein target rna cutting wasnt exciting m see also life scientific podcast mark

I have been searching for CRISPR/CAS9 videos to educate myself out of curiosity. I have been disappointed because they are either too simple or too complex. Your video is an excellent balance of the two for general population (include me). I hope there will be more people learn from your video and know how to make a scientific discovery educational yet understandable for the general public. Science will get a big boost if more people understand what it is all about.,searching crisprcas video educate curiosity disappointed either simple complex video excellent balance two general population include hope people learn video know make scientific discovery educational yet understandable general public science get big boost people understand

Unintended effects can result from the random insertion of DNA sequences into the plant genome which may cause disruption or silencing of existing genes, activation of silent genes, or modifications in the expression of existing genes. Unintended effects may also result in the formation of new or changed patterns of metabolites.

"I'm am trying to advocate for this and similar science. A question I get asked is whether or not scientists actually see these cells, the DNA, RNA. etc. and how they manipulate the parts. I understand we can see cells under a microscope, and I found some info about a microscope that can allow us to kind of see DNA....I guess the problem in part with all this is that we laypeople don't really know if we can believe and understand any of this. How can scientist study, much less manipulate something so small? Are these images symbolic and theory or can I accept the idea that they look like the pictures and models provided? Further, it's not like scientist are going in with tweezers placing little strands of RNA material into a cell similarly to what we've all seen with fertilizing an egg.  So what do I tell people? Further what is the procedure for finding and collecting these strands of DNA or RNA?

"I have understood that when a new type of phage  infects the bacterium,  a cas-protein will cut a piece out of the viral dna to become a spacer, which can then be used to guide another type of cas-protein to cut viral dna the next time the bacterium is infected by that virus. My question is then, why is the first type of cas-protein not sufficient to defect viral dna? I mean, the first cas-protein cuts a piece out of the viral dna to make it a spacer, but by doing this, at the same time it inactivates the virus. Why is this mechanism of creating spacers to guide type 2 cas-proteins necessary, when the type 1 cas-proteins can cut viral dna without needing a guide?",understood new type phage infects bacterium casprotein cut piece viral dna become spacer used guide another type casprotein cut viral dna next time bacterium infected virus question first type casprotein sufficient defect viral dna mean first casprotein cut piece viral dna make spacer time inactivates virus mechanism creating spacers guide type casproteins necessary type casproteins cut viral dna without needing guide

Instead of creating new diseases and focusing on creating new ones why don't we go back to the natural order of things. We have enough land and resources if used correctly to sustain humanity.

"It seems that scientists can use this system to insert, but not remove DNA. I wish they could just cut the unwanted DNA at both of its ends instead of at only one end at a time, so that it would be removed from our DNA. An editing system that can write, but not delete, is severely limited. Instead of trying to remove DNA, scientists will just try to fill it up with garbage in order to break it. That will make the DNA very messy and will make it much harder to actually perform deletions later in case they discover later how to finally accomplish that. I don't relish the thought of having my DNA made more messy and even harder to edit later because of this technique. I'm hugely disappointed by scientists yet again as usual; this was very overhyped.",seems scientist use system insert remove dna wish could cut unwanted dna end instead one end time would removed dna editing system write delete severely limited instead trying remove dna scientist try fill garbage order break make dna messy make much harder actually perform deletion later case discover later finally accomplish dont relish thought dna made messy even harder edit later technique im hugely disappointed scientist yet usual overhyped

"Absolute bangin'  video Paul. Helped a lot for my exams.

A question for you, and the science community, what do you are the challenges now with the CRISPR/Cas system (maybe a video...) -- specially when it comes to gene therapy? Is an efficient vector-delivery system still posed as our greatest barrier? 

Any idea on the efficiency of this system? Delivery, disruption of important genes...",absolute bangin video paul helped lot exam question science community challenge crisprcas system maybe video specially come gene therapy efficient vectordelivery system still posed greatest barrier idea efficiency system delivery disruption important gene

"Nice video, but I noticed you glossed over the tcrRNA bit. It seems to be like an arming mechanism for the protein. Also not clear yet is how the palindrome/tcrRNA part of the gRNA sequence can vary. Does it have to have a specific sequence for Cas9 to work? Lastly it is not clear how Cas1 identifies new foreign sequences to be added to the CRISPR system.",nice video noticed glossed tcrrna bit seems like arming mechanism protein also clear yet palindrometcrrna part grna sequence vary specific sequence ca work lastly clear ca identifies new foreign sequence added crispr system
