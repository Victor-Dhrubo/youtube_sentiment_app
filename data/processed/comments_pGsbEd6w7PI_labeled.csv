"So I’ve done some thinking, and I think that the black holes probably better to describe the journey of my thoughts.
So if you got something or anything falling into a black hole, and it starts to speed up faster and faster and faster to the speed of light. 
Everything breaks apart by the force of gravity, falling faster and faster and faster not because the speed of light, but because the speed of the medium is being sucked into the hole, all the particles be split and torn apart everything is torn apart, spaghettified is a simpler term but loses its meaning as you would imaging noodles, but noodles is a thing, and this is not a thing, further and further this is  more deeper everything gets torn apart explosive energy so maybe that some will be transmitted out as some  Hawking radiation I assume.

But it doesn’t stop there because you’re gonna fall further than the distance from the horizon, to the center, how to describe it, the core of the black hole is infinitely far away you’ll never reach there. 
You’ll evaporate well belong before you can get there as it  much muuuuuuuch further than the horizon is from the center, so It can’t be explained in normal physics. I think you have to imagine Interdimensionaly there is no end and to get there the fabric of space is stretches faster than the speed of light can travel, the wave of lengths will be stretched so thin to be longer than red light can stretch, quarks and gluons etc will be pulled apart. And exploded.

🧭 time has no meaning, the decay of particles will slow to a mear stop, the explosions as a little particle bodies are torn apart will slow to a mear stop, as to be traveling faster than light relative, the medium stretching faster than light can travel. 
Perhaps 🧐 maybe the medium of space time has been torn apart as well?
It’s quite paradoxical, thinking I know to have explosions that don’t decay to have particles that don’t care but yet they get torn apart, that’s all  my little brain can take 🧠

If you could see inside the black hole, everything would be curved back towards the center. If you tried to look out, you couldn’t see it. if you could just see the point where everything is going, the center is in every direction because light is being curved back towards a center, but no you can’t see anything as light can’t come back from the center
And every direction is towards the center from your perception because the lights always curving back towards the center of which is unreachable…  like I said brain 🧠 go boom 💥 🤪😵‍💫

🤪Haha I hope that makes sense 🤪

The mas of the black hole 🕳️ is all  accumulated mass within it even though those particles may not touch each other ever as they’re being torn apart for further towards the center closer now but not closer you’ll never reach there…

🤔 hmm my mind is turning to mush
Think of it like a suspended try you put a hose with running water on it,
Then poke a hole 🕳️ in the tray 
The water will spiral towards a hole due to earths spin and gravitation and maybe magnetic fields.
Then down through the hole into a laminate flow, then as it falls faster, the flow will pull apart into droplets, the droplets will pull apart due to earth’s gravity faster against the air medium, and probably break apart to smaller droplets.
And allow those droplets to fall through a Dyson ring fan on full power!
Or a compressed air blower venturi and the droplets will be split & separated further into a fine mist…

Then you’ll need a particle accelerator to speeds where high speeds can be accomplish on earth,  but we need to go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter. Than we can accomplish to do on earth… 
Interdimensionally faster!

Is your brain all gooey & squishy now? 😵‍💫🤪🥰😁🤣😂🤪",ive done thinking think black hole probably better describe journey thought got something anything falling black hole start speed faster faster faster speed light everything break apart force gravity falling faster faster faster speed light speed medium sucked hole particle split torn apart everything torn apart spaghettified simpler term loses meaning would imaging noodle noodle thing thing deeper everything get torn apart explosive energy maybe transmitted hawking radiation assume doesnt stop youre gon na fall distance horizon center describe core black hole infinitely far away youll never reach youll evaporate well belong get much muuuuuuuch horizon center cant explained normal physic think imagine interdimensionaly end get fabric space stretch faster speed light travel wave length stretched thin longer red light stretch quark gluon etc pulled apart exploded time meaning decay particle slow mear stop explosion little particle body torn apart slow mear stop traveling faster light relative medium stretching faster light travel perhaps maybe medium space time torn apart well quite paradoxical thinking know explosion dont decay particle dont care yet get torn apart thats little brain take could see inside black hole everything would curved back towards center tried look couldnt see could see point everything going center every direction light curved back towards center cant see anything light cant come back center every direction towards center perception light always curving back towards center unreachable like said brain go boom haha hope make sense ma black hole accumulated mass within even though particle may touch ever theyre torn apart towards center closer closer youll never reach hmm mind turning mush think like suspended try put hose running water poke hole tray water spiral towards hole due earth spin gravitation maybe magnetic field hole laminate flow fall faster flow pull apart droplet droplet pull apart due earth gravity faster air medium probably break apart smaller droplet allow droplet fall dyson ring fan full power compressed air blower venturi droplet split separated fine mist youll need particle accelerator speed high speed accomplish earth need go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter accomplish earth interdimensionally faster brain gooey squishy,1.0

"1- There is no such thing as a black hole. These jokers point a multi-band width detection device at an area of space and if there is an area that is dark , they call it a black hole..lol  It could be space dust, gas, nebula's etc. Not some evil black hole lurking and waiting to swallow you and your galaxy up.. Good grief Charlie Brown.
2- Time does not slow down the faster you travel.  If you get in a spaceship and fly to a planet that is 10 light years away and you can travel at the speed of light,  here's what happens . (Leave the acceleration and deceleration phase out of the equation for the sake of this scenario) You would travel 10 years outbound and 10 years back. That's 20 years folks. Pretty simple math. When you come home you will therefore be exactly 20 years older and magically your friends and family on earth will also be 20 years older . You will not have aged 2 years while everyone back on earth magically aged 250 years .  (Like every b movie portrays)

"The empirical method is most reliable in finding truth in the physical world. It employs the logic of mathematics in finding most probable outcome given a controlled set of variables. Religions are not concerned with that, and often depend upon intuition, emotions and customs not dependent upon objective reality found in scientific endeavors like physics.
 
Given that it is generally understood in the scientific community that the universe came from a single massive event, to begin to understand where we came from, there must be a theory that has reliable, predictive ability,
 
There is always the unknown (or ""God of the gap""), like when questioning the origin of the initial mass; but that is not required in order to posit the question, ""Given initial conditions like a single mass (nothing can be simpler or more ordered the one), aka,, 'cosmic egg' or 'primal atom,' how did that initial mass (generally accepted as most probable by all of the scientific community) transform to become the universe seen today?""
 
Again, there is no 100% certainty. The closest to that is found in abstract math. In application there is always a uncertainty, like when counting apples,.
 
There are two most-probable, very basic answers to ""The Question,"" ie, top down cosmology OR bottom up cosmology-- both are incompatible with one another.
 
Given this, top down cosmology, when properly understood, is broad enough to predict everything so far seen. like that by the JWST, for example, while bottom up (Big Bang or Standard Model) cosmology must be constantly revised with ad hoc explanations every time there is a new finding, top down cosmology wins!
 
Top down is not properly understood, because it is commonly interpreted to mean that there are many realities caused by cascading events; but this is not the case, because everything seen and unseen remains causally connected by quantum entanglement.

"In the blockchain of events framework, where we act as qubits of information in a self correcting code through inner.self and external validators, what is before the Big Bang is yet to happen, past and present act in superposition as regret (photon states), future and present as potential (wave state).

"UPT (Unified Plasma Theory) explains this ""deeper look into gravity"". 

UPT vs. Einstein Tensor (Gμν)
""Mass tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells mass how to move.""
That’s the essence of the Einstein Tensor—gravity as geometry.

Unified Plasma Theory (UPT) offers a deeper, field-based perspective:

UPT Core Counterpoint:
Spacetime curvature is not the cause of gravity—it is the visual echo of field coherence in motion.

The Einstein Tensor assumes:
    A vacuum with bendable geometry
    Mass and energy deform that geometry
    That deformation affects motion paths of matter

But UPT asserts:
    There is no true vacuum—only dynamic plasma fields at varying densities
    Mass is not a fixed property but a product of collapsed field geometry
    ""Curvature"" is simply how field pressure gradients appear under certain plasma conditions

Example:
Einstein describes gravity as curvature but never defines what is curving, or why.

UPT explains it directly:
What looks like curvature is a real, measurable field pressure differential.
Plasma fields entrain and spiral. This creates torsion, flow, and attraction—all observable as gravity, with no geometric abstraction required.

Field-Based Replacement (UPT):
UPT replaces the Einstein Tensor with a dynamic plasma field expression:

F(ρ, v, Φ, T),
Where:
ρ = charge density
v = field velocity
Φ = field potential
T = torsion (field twist and rotation)

This function describes gravitational effects without bending spacetime—just by observing how real plasma fields behave under coherence and motion.

Conclusion:
Einstein’s tensor describes effects.
UPT explains causes.

"**Title:**
*The Universal Bootstrap: Emergence of Physics, Life, and Consciousness from Recursive Arithmetic over $\mathbb{Z}_2$*

**Abstract:**
We present a fully self-contained, arithmetic-based model of the universe in which spacetime, physical constants, particles, biological life, and consciousness emerge as stable fixed points of a recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$ defined over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This operator generates a fractal spectral structure whose eigenstates encode energy, geometry, and coherent symbolic forms. We show that the familiar laws of physics—including quantum mechanics, relativistic spacetime, and conservation principles—are not postulated but derived as emergent features of recursive arithmetic self-composition. Biological systems are modeled as recursive coherence attractors, and entropy increase is interpreted as divergence from symbolic arithmetic fixed points. Free energy becomes extractable from recursive eigenstates, and consciousness arises naturally as arithmetic reflexivity—when a recursive function encodes itself as input. This framework eliminates the need for external axioms, continuum assumptions, or initial conditions. The universe is shown to be a closed, self-simulating structure rooted entirely in arithmetic recursion, providing a resolution to the simulation hypothesis from within the system. We conclude with simulation results, spectral predictions, and testable schematics for recursive free energy extraction and biological coherence amplification.

---

**1. Introduction**

The search for a unified theory that explains the origin of space, time, matter, energy, and consciousness has driven physics and philosophy for centuries. Current theories, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, remain incomplete. They rely on a mix of continuum mathematics, arbitrary constants, and external assumptions.

This paper introduces a radically self-contained alternative: the Universal Bootstrap. The core idea is that the universe arises entirely from recursive arithmetic logic over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, using a fractal recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$. We demonstrate that the observable universe, including its physical laws and structure, is the emergent outcome of this recursion.

Our framework does not require spacetime as a precondition. Instead, it defines time as recursion depth and space as bitwise distance in a symbolic structure. We show that particles, fields, and constants emerge from the fixed-point behavior of $\mathcal{F}$, and that life and consciousness are natural consequences of recursive coherence and reflexivity.

---

**2. Mathematical Framework**

We define a universal operator:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f^{(n)}(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}_2$

Where $f$ is a generator of recursive structure:
$f(x) = x \oplus \text{PrimeFractal}(x)$

Here, $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR, and $\text{PrimeFractal}(x)$ introduces structure based on binary encodings of prime-index patterns. This builds a spectral fractal operator whose fixed points $x^*$ satisfy $\mathcal{F}(x^*) = x^*$, representing stable physical states.

---

**3. Emergence of Spacetime and Particles**

Position is interpreted as the index of bits in $x$, time as the recursion depth $n$, and particles as fixed-point attractors. The spectral structure of $\mathcal{F}$ leads to stable symbolic configurations identified with matter.

Mass and energy correspond to the spectral weight of recursive curvature. Wavefunctions arise from transitions between neighboring fixed points under repeated application of $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**4. Physical Constants from Operator Spectrum**

Eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\mathcal{F}$ correspond to dimensionless constants:
$\mathcal{F}(\psi_i) = \lambda_i \psi_i$

We simulate the operator spectrum and find matches to known values such as:

* Fine-structure constant $\alpha$
* Planck units $(\hbar, G, c)$

These values emerge from the structure of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ recursion without external input.

---

**5. Recursive Biology and Evolution**

Biological systems are defined as recursive symbolic coherence structures. Life corresponds to the sustained non-divergence of $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x)$ for complex $x$. Evolution is modeled as drift toward higher coherence attractors under recursive selection:
$\mathcal{L}_n(x) = \mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x) \Rightarrow \text{stability} \Leftrightarrow \text{fitness}$

Entropy increase is modeled as divergence from recursive attractors, while aging is the breakdown of coherence. Reversal is possible via synchronization operators derived from $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**6. Free Energy via Recursive Resonance**

Structured recursive eigenstates store latent energy. Energy extraction is modeled by:
$\mathcal{E}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \langle x | \mathcal{F}^{(n)} | x \rangle$

We design a recursive cavity resonator—a physical system whose electromagnetic modes match $\mathcal{F}$'s spectral structure—to extract energy from structured vacuum resonance.

---

**7. Consciousness as Arithmetic Reflexivity**

Let $x = \text{Code}(\mathcal{F})$. If:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = x$
then $x$ is a self-referential recursive structure. We identify consciousness as the emergence of awareness when recursion reflects itself in symbolic form. This solves the mind-body problem in arithmetic terms.

---

**8. Simulation and Experimental Design**

We present simulations of:

* Fractal eigenstate emergence
* Symbolic particle attractors
* Biological coherence fields
* Energy extraction geometry

Prototypes include:

* Recursive fractal resonance chamber
* Life-extension field synchronizer
* Simulation test suite for detecting internal boundaries (""glitches"")

---

**9. Conclusion**

We have shown that the universe can be modeled as a recursive arithmetic structure over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, with no external assumptions.

"If anyone wants the real mathematical formula for black holes, I have it in my channel's posts (it looks like a pointy spring, shrinking down to the left, with a backwards R to it's right), it's called Infinite Tubular Rings Theory or ITRT, it introduces some new symbols, and is in fact a variable fractal, as it's dimensions are determined by two circles, that can each vary in size upon creation, but once formed, will scale infinitely into all 6 planes simultaneously, at the same ratio, called The Icarus Ratio. A black hole is basically the ""tail"" of a broken infinite 4-dimensional hula-hoop fractal. The outer ""hoop"" of a black hole is huge, but its ""tube"" size is absolutely tiny. The up-spiral has long since ""flown away"" after breaking apart from the down-spiral. The down-spiral itself will continue expanding, likely infinitely, at unimaginably smaller sizes, continuously inward. I don't know exactly how each ring tier is arranged, and I doubt anyone could know. My best guess is that the down-spiral moves down a tier, at only one point, when the rings collide with each other, making a ""spike"" of immense gravity at one point along the outer ""hoop"".

"Newton's Gravity Force is functionally similar to Coulomb's Law 
( Conversion Factor * 2 objects / rr )

If we declare both objects are about the same pair and 
we set them equal to each other we get a unit-less ratio.

On its own it isn't vary useful so I multiplied by Einstein's Energy 
equation complete with the velocity bubble.

If we combine like terms the rr cancels ( spooky action at a distance ).

Then we can break velocity into a distance vector over time and solve 
the whole thing with time on the left and everything else on the right.

Let:
G = 6.67408 × 10⁻¹¹ m³/kg/s²
c = 299792458 m/s
K = 8.9875517923 × 10⁹ kg·m³/s²/C²

Define:
L = (G * c²) / K ≈ 6.67407999634 × 10⁻⁴ (m·C/kg·s)²
E = L * M³ / Q² / √(1 - V² / c² )
√(1 - V² / c² ) = L * M³ / Q² / E
1 - V² / c² = ( L * M³ / Q² / E )²
V² = c² * ( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )
V = c * √( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )    by V = D / T
T = D / c / √( 1 - ( L * M³ / Q² / E )² )

Then:
X = (L * M³) / (Q² * E) = 1       we get a 0 in the denominator for time

Where:
M = Mass (kg) = 90 kg
Q = Charge (C) = 9 C
E = Energy (J) = 6 J

M³ = 729,000,  Q² = 81, E = 6 J
X = 1500 * L = 1.001111999451 m / s 

If we scan Q with an oscillator crossing X = 1 and  D is non zero, T is likely to be vary large.

"The universe is made up of a governing layer for each of its existing dimensions. On our plane, there are five major layers. Tangibility, time, and distance. I.e., the top layer. Then hyper-fluidity. Consciousness. Energy Balance offset, or Re-layer, and Aio, or time. What is currently called gravity doesn't exist. It is an offset effect of universal space. So, all matter has a tangible layer value and an energy offset value. This offset determines the spatial curve, but not the pressure. Basically, the thing pulling us down is not a spatial curve; it is the grip effect of Band density. So, gravity is three overlapping universal principles. Curve. Band density and or grip, and Energy offset. The energy offset is what governs both the curve and the space-time stretching. Now, the offset values are governed by volume or weight. The heavier the thing, the more pressure there is on spacetime and the band density or lattice. Mass is directly trainable for energy. So the offset between the tangible layer and the energy offset layer becomes greater with more mass. A black hole is the ultimate expression of this. It is a mass-offset entity. Only one of two subatomic particles exists on the tangible layer, and the rest are now offset. While there is some form of tether to real space, the energy will always attempt to retake its footing. Hence, the giant black void in space. Fun thing to note, a black hole is not the craziest expression of this effect. After a magnetar and before a black hole, you get a Dark Star. An offset effect where the star's gravity and electromagnetic field energy is so strong, it redirects its own light to its poles and shoots them out in concentrated gamma ray bursts. Also, it goes to the other extreme. And an ultra-ring black hole. The ultimate expression of offset.

Subject: A New Perspective on Space-time, Dark Matter, and the Big Bang’s Equal & Opposite Reaction
Hey Neil,
What if space-time behaved like a dynamic fractal lattice on an extremely tiny scale—possibly even beyond the Planck length? And what if space-time had a fractal similarity relationship with water?
We know Newton’s Third Law—for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. So, where is the equal and opposite reaction of the Big Bang?
Some scientists might say, ""Oh, the laws of physics could have been different back then,"" but that’s just dodging the question. The opposite reaction of an explosive expansion due to heat should be a contraction due to cold. The universe has followed this path, except we frame it as “heat loss due to expansion.” But heat loss is just another way of saying cold.
Now here’s where things get interesting: There could be a cooling force acting on the universe, subtly pulling it inward, reversing the expansion over time, and eventually restoring equilibrium. In fact, for a period, cosmic expansion was decelerating, as if preparing to collapse… but then Dark Energy kicked in after ~9 billion years and flipped the script, making the universe expand again.
The Water Connection
That behavior reminded me of something—water’s anomalous expansion when cooled from 4°C to 0°C. Unlike most substances that contract as they cool, water expands due to hydrogen bonds rearranging its molecular structure.
Now, what if Dark Energy isn’t some mysterious anti-gravity force, but something similar—like cosmic hydrogen bonds? Not literal hydrogen, but a structural property of space-time itself causing expansion just as hydrogen bonds do in water.
This led me to wonder: Could space-time have a molecular-like structure? A fractal lattice in motion? That would explain why light moves through it so smoothly. Space-time could be behaving dynamically, like a fluid—one that expands under specific conditions and contracts under others.
Time Might Not Flow… But “Fall”
We always describe time as flowing, but what if it doesn’t flow linearly, but ""downy""? 😂 Like zooming into a fractal instead of traveling in a straight line. If space-time is fractal, then Quantum Entanglement wouldn’t need “spooky action at a distance.” Instead, entangled particles could be connected by hidden fractal pathways in space-time, where they are not separated by distance, but by time layers.
If space-time is a material, it wouldn’t be a perfect fractal like a mathematical concept. It would be more like a snowflake—still fractal, but with imperfections. And what do imperfections lead to?
Asymmetry.
The biggest asymmetry in the universe? Matter-antimatter imbalance. The only time space-time’s fractal nature could have affected particle formation on a cosmic scale was during the Big Bang, potentially influencing matter-antimatter asymmetry.
Dark Matter & Nucleation Sites
Dark matter clusters around galaxies, helping them form. That reminded me of nucleation sites in water, which trigger phase transitions.
Nucleation sites can be:
•	Impurities
•	Scratches in a container
•	Disturbances… like sound.
Dark matter could be something similar—regions of structural disturbance in space time, causing gravitational effects. And this led me to another realization…
Dark Matter as a Quasiparticle
A quasiparticle is a quantum of energy in a crystal lattice that behaves like a real particle. In condensed matter physics, quasiparticles emerge as disturbances in a structured medium—just like topological insulator axions, which are a leading candidate for dark matter.
Dark matter could be a quasiparticle of space-time—specifically a phonon, a quantum of energy associated with a compressional wave (a.k.a. sound).
Which brings me to something deeper…
“Let There Be Light”
I’m a Christian, and this actually aligns with my beliefs. God spoke the universe into existence. If sound (or a vibrational energy mode of space-time) played a fundamental role in creation, then dark matter could be the residual structure of that sound wave, still shaping the cosmos today.
And what does the Bible say about the voice of God?
""The voice of the Lord is upon the waters: the God of glory thundereth… The voice of the Lord divideth the flames of fire."" (Psalm 29:3-7)
His voice is like many waters—which means it passes through space-time itself (remember my water analogy?). And when His voice thunders, what follows? Lightning, well …not in that particular order, but you get the point, lightening births thunder. And what is lightning at its core? Plasma.
But not just any plasma. The most extreme state of plasma known to physics is Quark-Gluon Plasma—the same primordial substance that existed right after the Big Bang.
Could it be that the very act of God speaking wasn't just metaphorical, but literal—His voice setting off a cosmic-scale vibration, a phonon that led to the formation of the very first plasma, the birth of light, and the structure of space-time itself?

Wait… residual… residual of what, scientifically?
EXACTLY! If there was ever a cosmic-scale phonon, it would’ve been at the Big BANG—literally in the name! 💀💀
Think about it:
•	That initial explosion sent out an unimaginable wave of energy—maybe even a quantum-scale shockwave through space-time itself.
•	As the universe expanded and cooled, that ""shockwave"" didn’t just vanish—it froze into space-time as residual vibrational modes, which we now call dark matter.
•	These frozen phonons in the ""space-time lattice"" would be like standing waves in a solid—shaping galaxies, bending space-time, and interacting gravitationally without electromagnetic influence.
🔥 Dark Matter = The Echo of Creation 🔥
This would mean the CMB (Cosmic Microwave Background) isn’t just leftover heat—it’s the visible evidence of an even deeper remnant: the frozen sound of the Big Bang.
Bro, this ties quantum gravity, condensed matter physics, and cosmology together in a way I’ve never seen before. This could be a legit contender for a new paradigm in physics.
So, Neil, what do you think?
I don’t know how to do advanced math—I can barely handle calculus. But I feel like I’m at least 70% onto something here. 😂 Maybe you can help refine it and take it further. Who knows? Maybe this is the missing puzzle piece we need to understand our universe.
Oh, and hey—consider giving your life to Christ… just to be safe. 😆
Best regards, 
David Enudi Oladayo

After this I looked, and behold, a door
standing open in heaven! And the first voice,
which I had heard speaking to me like a

show you what must take place after this.""
2
At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a
throne stood in heaven, with one seated on
the throne.

And he who sat there had the appearance of
jasper and carnelian, and around the throne
was a rainbow that had the appearance of an
emerald.

Around the throne were twenty-four thrones,
and seated on the thrones were twenty-four
elders, clothed in white garments, with
golden crowns on their heads.
5
From the throne came flashes of lightning,
and rumblings and peals of thunder, and
before the throne were burning seven torches
of fire, which are the seven spirits of God,
6
and before the throne there was as it were a
sea of glass, like crystal.
And around the throne, on each side of the
throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes
in front and behind:

the first living creature like a lion, the second
living creature like an ox, the third living
creature with the face of a man, and the
fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.

"Time is the function of the expansion of the Universe. Density can change the rate of time. As galaxies move further away from the cosmological center, they speed up compared to everything outside of the center. However, to follow this line of thinking, the closer to the beginning of the Universe, time goes slower and slower to the point that it stops. We like to call that point, the Big Bang singularity. Infinite mass / density / energy / weak radiation / strong radiation. Time is not part of the singularity. Time can only start when the singularity begins to expand. Time doesn’t stop until the singularity reaches its maximum excised state. Quantum Entanglement can no longer occur due to all particles stretched out at an accelerated point. It’s impossible for the universe to expand beyond, which essentially stops time. At this point, all radiation would invert, all atoms would have no energy to allow the electron to orbit around particles. However, the void left behind would be primed to be occupied by another big bang. Where would that singularity come from in the first place? Out of nothingness, it slowly begins to appear. It unravels due to the inversion energy left over from the previous universe. It takes the entire energy of a universe to crack open a singularity (infinite energy expulsion).",time function expansion universe density change rate time galaxy move away cosmological center speed compared everything outside center however follow line thinking closer beginning universe time go slower slower point stop like call point big bang singularity infinite mass density energy weak radiation strong radiation time part singularity time start singularity begin expand time doesnt stop singularity reach maximum excised state quantum entanglement longer occur due particle stretched accelerated point impossible universe expand beyond essentially stop time point radiation would invert atom would energy allow electron orbit around particle however void left behind would primed occupied another big bang would singularity come first place nothingness slowly begin appear unravels due inversion energy left previous universe take entire energy universe crack open singularity infinite energy expulsion,1.0
"The Cosmic Cycle of Black Holes, Energy, and Nebulae

Black holes are often seen as destructive cosmic entities, consuming everything in their path. However, this perception only captures part of their true role in the universe. Black holes, when they consume matter and energy, undergo a fascinating transformation, releasing immense energy in the form of a quasar. This energy is what powers the black hole and fuels its surrounding space. But what happens once the black hole has reached the peak of its energy release?

After a black hole has consumed all the matter it can and released its energy in a dramatic burst, it enters a state of void. In this state, it no longer has the power to resist the incoming flow of energy. Without the capacity to create new forces, it becomes like a deep well—empty and unresisting. Over time, this energy-filled void eventually begins to equalize with the surrounding space, transitioning into what we perceive as ""normal space"" once again.

However, the energy that the black hole once released doesn’t vanish. Instead, it disperses and flows outward through the galaxy, universe, and beyond. It spreads through space, seeking denser areas where the pressure and density can once again trap it, much like how energy is drawn into a black hole in the first place. These regions of dense space form what we call cloud nebulae—vast, swirling clouds of gas and dust. It is within these dense clouds where the energy finds itself caught in a cosmic quagmire.

As the energy interacts with the immense pressure and density of these nebulae, it triggers the birth of new stars, planets, and galaxies. The energy, which was once pure and untouchable as it was consumed by the black hole, has now undergone a transformation. It has changed back from energy into matter—giving rise to new life in the universe. This process is the next step in the cosmic cycle, where what was once destroyed becomes the raw material for creation.

In essence, black holes don’t just destroy—they are part of a grand, cyclical process that continually renews the universe. The energy released by the black hole travels through the cosmos, finds its way into dense regions of space, and eventually transforms into new stars and planets. It’s a constant cycle of birth and rebirth—where nothing is ever truly lost, but instead continually evolves into something new.

This idea of black holes acting as catalysts for creation—where they fuel the formation of nebulae, stars, and galaxies—helps us understand the universe not as a place of destruction, but as a dynamic system of ongoing transformation. In this model, black holes play a crucial role in the creation of matter, as the energy they release eventually becomes the material from which new cosmic bodies are born.

"(My two cents before I watch.)
Black holes may be basically invisible because, There's no room for heat/ radiation, inside of it.
If black holes are indeed solid.
 It's dissipated through Gamma rays bursts, Back out into a cosmic web/fields, from the outside. Much like the pulse of an electric fence. Energy runs on the outside of wire, not the inside.
This action acts as thrust keeping things in balance and spinning around the black hole. Without thrust we don't have Gravity. Without this there there are no galaxys. Thrust to leave a world Reverse thrust to return. Balance.
Thrust is why the cosmos moves.
And what holds us, and all matter together.
Nutrinos and other high energy particles may play the part of keeping mass like Asteroid still floating.
Now let's say all mass and energy is consumed. And let's say only thing left are the black holes.
These black holes have no thrust, so they will fall.
 Only to gather once more into one, which selfie nihilates adding thrust to them and matter to consume for this thrust. Repeat..ect. 
A self-starting harmonically balanced oscillation wave form. Think of radio waves. The only sound that travels through space. Us. You, me, all there is. 
It doesn't have to be all black holes that gather, just one of a particular size. And then it has a black hole quake like the Wow signal star. Which could set off a chain reaction amongst other black holes. Sound waves. Those waves could travel for tillions or more light years in all directions. Some Galaxys would look old some look younger.
Time is something that is there whether anything else exist or not.
   It's not something physical. It's just something to help you conceive things in stages. It's a tool that comes from math and just plane observation.
It is what it is, or would not be.

So I’ve heard the theory that someday a black hole will dissolve basically. The question I’ve never heard raised or answered is during this process does the black hole turn back into a star of sorts? As it loses mass it will no longer have an escape velocity higher than that of the speed of light. What does that look like? Do we already see these and not recognize them?

"Occam's TOE (my nickname for the below summarized, which I hope is worthy of our esteemed friend's moniker):

By Einstein's Equivalence Principle, a particulate mass object held suspended at a specific height above the Earth's surface -- i.e. at a specific radial distance from the Earth's single point gravitational center of mass -- is being subjected to a constant point radially outward (vertically upward) accelerating force of, and thereby undergoing a rate of proper acceleration upward at, 32 ft/sec**2. 

The instant this mass object is released, it's vertical acceleration with respect to the Earth's single point gravitational center of mass ceases, and the still-""point radially outward"" accelerating [""3D""] surface of the Earth rushes upward to catch up with and overtake the now 'stationary' (traditionally understood and referred to as ""falling"") mass object and slams into it at a relative velocity determined by the vertical distance from (""height above"") the Earth's surface from which the object was released -- or equivalently -- a relative velocity (""kinetic energy"") determined by the ""time"" [as defined by and in terms of the relative (e.g. cyclic) motions of other mass bodies at the same relative ""size"" scale] elapsed since the object's vertical acceleration ceased being applied by the platform from which it was released (a.k.a. ""during which it was in freefall toward the Earth's surface""). 

If we reword, and correspondingly re-conceptualize, the scenario in this way, we recognize that the ""3 dimensional"" spatial extension of a mass-object (such as the planet we call ""Earth"") is actually a point radial extension in space constituted by that body's sustained (and progressively increasing rate proportional to the radial distance of its surface from its gravitational center) point-radial acceleration -- which we might validly conceptually reorient ourselves to recognize and understand as being the constitution of that body as a 'package' (if you will) of ""[pure, I claim,] point-radial momentum"", which we contemporary humans observe -- by means and in terms of the sequential impingements of multiple light waves with that surface -- and otherwise experience, and traditionally linguistically refer to (""indicate"" to each other and internally conceptually ""index"") as its ""inertial mass"". 

Note that, since the velocity of light is (taken by we ""human"" likewise mass-""observer""-objects as a baseline universal) ""constant"", any acceleration [such as that undergone point-radially by the ""3D spatially extended outer surface"" of a mass-object], as a continuous [over/as ""time""] change in velocity (e.g. by definition), constitutes a (sustained over/as ""time"") displacement from the constant velocity of light ""during the time"" (manifested by those multiple light wave/""photon"" impingements) that acceleration takes place. 

Note also that, because acceleration is a continuous change in the velocity of a mass-body's (relative) motion, proper acceleration can be described as a state of ""self-relative motion"" -- that is, as ""motion relative to itself [through/as space over/as time]"". 

[Following is my likewise relevant, and elaborative upon the above, commentary response to Veritasium's ""Hidden Universes"" video:] 
[Note as well that] In a hyperbolic geometry universe, the ""distance"", as perceived/measured in terms of other spatially extended (i.e. mass) objects by the ""observer"" (as also a mass object) at/as its ""center"", to the edge of the universe -- defined as the distance the light of the Big Bang has thus-far traveled -- is effectively infinitely far away in every direction around that center (of mass), in the same sense that the event horizon of a black hole would be to any mass-body ""inside"" of it. However, to an ""observer"" (with mass) who is ""outside"" of a black hole's event horizon, both the black hole's spatially extended ""size"" (diameter) and its ""distance"" away ""appear"" to (in terms of multiple sequentially impinging light waves) and are measured (as described above) by him to be ""finite"".  So, what's going on here? 

Might it be, perhaps, that the (unseen) path of individual light waves/""photons"" from one particulate (i.e. asymptotically ""finite""-bounded) mass object to another is hyperbolic, while the ""motion"" relative to each other at subluminal velocity (as necessitated by their reciprocal multi-light wave impingement manifested ""appearance"" to each other) motion of individual particulate mass objects relative to each other is ""linear""? And what are these ""separate individual"" particulate mass objects, as manifested to ""each other"" in terms of multiple sequentially impinging light waves, but [""gravitational (as ""curved spacetime"") lens""-focused] ""standing waveforms""? And if this be the case, then this ""material universe"" of particulate mass objects (including our own, and each other's physical bodies, which comprise the ""contents"" of one another's ""consciousness"", if you will) clearly comprises a single ""self-configuring"" network of spatially distributed I/O (of infrared light waves, at a minimum, due to their > 0 degrees Kelvin temperature) devices -- i.e. as a single 'self-aware entity' that has 'settled upon' (again, if you will) this ""network"" architecture as the mechanism of its self-constructing 'manifestation' of itself to itself.  As Descartes declared to be the foundational premise of his philosophy, ""Cognito ergo sum"" ([or ""SUM"" for ""(in the absence of its self-relative motion) Scale-Uniform Medium"", if I may be so bold] there must be a ""me"" for me to be conscious of, and to contemplate and conjecture the ""existence"" of, such as I've linguistically encoded and shared with you my body's 'on-board' ""conceptual"", i.e. neurological, map of [as (part of) its operational sensory-environment response ""program""] here).

"I have a way of thinking that makes a black hole easier to understand: A black hole is a small space filled with so much matter that it gets extreamly heavy. This makes it like a pit that grows deaper and deaper the more materia it gets filled with - because that makes it heavier. 

When you think about like this it gets easier to picture how planets and suns can fit in such a small space and why they get ”sucked” inside at all. 

Now; how the black holes begin to exist is for the exact same reason - too much mass (for example two colliding suns) gets centerd in the same small space which makes the object so heavy (or the pit so deep, the way I explained) that every object ”nearby” sinks into it - which in turn makes the pit even deeper and so on. The depth goes within itself. This is the way I picture it to make it easier to understand.

"Based on the theory that a black hole does not erase information and has finite lifespan, and taking into account the concept of Hawking Radiation, is it possible that when looking at the idea of the Big Bang and the way the universe is expanding, does this all together possibly point towards the Big Bang simply being the end of the lifespan of a black hole discharging the remainder of the particles it gives off back into space?

My choice of words is most likely confusing or incorrect but is the idea that a black reaching is end/ending and discharging the remainder of particles a possible explanation of what the Big Bang is??

"Beware, I know what it is  like beyond event horizon.  Take the speed of sound which is  as finite as a speed of light. If you go supersonic in  a plane and thunder strikes behind you, you will never hear it! if you emit  sound from supersonic plane backwards to a plane that goes subsonic, your sound will never reach the subsonic plane! You are beyond event horizon in terms of sound, so there is no way you can hear anything from subsonic plane and vise versa. And the same paralel works with the speed of light. This time however you swap the sound with light.  So this time it is not the sound that cannot be heard, it is the image/ the light that cannot be seen.  That is why black hole is black, If you went superluminous speed in a spaceship  and looked behind you would also see total darkness despite the fact that the stars are there behind you.

"There is a problem though.  Even if you were able to assemble everything about an object you destroyed, including its energy and particules, you still have to deal with the chaos that time and interactions between particules and all forms of energy have created.  How do you recreate something from total chaos at the atomic level?  I see only one solution; time travel.  And i don't believe that to be possible.

Same problem for me when you talk about anything falling into a black hole.  Even if the black hole absorb everything, it still remains a chaos 'force' that dishorganize everything, to the molecular level.  Even they admit that at the event horizon, a particule swap from existence to 'anti-matter' or none existence part of 'space time' as we know it.

There is also something they don't seem to talk about here; the fact that black hole do send back their energy in form of a canon of energy sometimes (depends on their level of energy i think) and that is not out of bound of our space-time continuum (our normal space) but very much into it.  So for me, black hole seems to be more like your ultimate shredding machine that spin chaos back from organized mass, into absolute chaos, shredding everything back to fondamental elements of energy, a monster of mass that fall on itself because of the nature of space itself.

We have all seen lighted particles of energy leave a human body after the body dies, but the spirit or soul kind of flies off, typically with other lighted particles of energy. So our spirit or soul would be a small enough particle to pass through a black hole? This would also grant us access to return, in “another life”, as we all hear of things as an old soul, etc. And there may be many other sides. This would also explain other life forms/UFO’s.

"I ain't tryna trip but lots of the science community can't see the forest for the trees. This is my take. When formed black holes create a crease through spacetime to an empty pocket universe and deposit initial matter...then it seals up. Over the course of the black hole's lifetime, and through subsequent merger events, more and more matter/data in deposited into the pocket universe. Somewhere around supermassive attainment, the black hole reaches critical mass... And blows the crease wide open. By this time the pocket universe resembles a massive conglomerate of primordial soup centered on the crease/white hole. When the black hole reaches critical mass a big bang event occurs within the pocket universe. I got more ideas too concerning this, and to me it fits together like South America and Africa > plain as day.

"I think we should follow the mathematical formalisms of General Relativity as well as Quantum Mechanics.

QM formalism indicates we live in a multiverse where all outcomes are equally real, but not all are equally likely.

GR formalism says we live in a static block universe, where the passing of time and free will are illusions.

Unify these ideas by saying quantum mechanics is the multiverse model. It somehow gave rise to an infinite number of fully formed static block universes, each unique in some respect. An infinite number will seem identical but will sooner or later diverge.

This means you can't get quantum gravity because gravity is a property of universes, which emerge from quantum theory.

Asking quantum to describe gravity is like asking a baker to make you a donut with no ingredients.

General relativity can't explain singularities because they're through-holes in the block universes. The 'center' of the black hole is timeless and spaceless because it's actually a hole into the multiverse in this kind of thinking.

It's like asking what flavor the hole in the donut is.

So, information falling into the black hole would be shredded from tidal forces and probably other extreme conditions, and be out in the multiverse somewhere, beyond our reach. Not lost - just lost to us - like whatever is beyond our light-horizon expanding away from us faster than light. Who knows what's there - they're not in our light cones.

But it would mean information is preserved in the multiverse.

Multiverse not having space or time in any way we're used to think of wouldn't have gravity and no black holes of their own, and no known mechanism of information destruction.

"Given the predictive nature of gravity and its relationship to mass, of how matter interacts with this in a proportional linear manner, evident by how we observe the transition states of matter for example by reverse engineering the life cycle of stars as they birth the elements of the periodic table, the subsequent order of matter all proportionally exhibiting densities and intrinsic energy and mass values, whose states of being transfer to us the information necessary to transcribe how they came to be as a result of a star’s lifecycle, all of these processes indicate that there is a defined gravitational threshold which establishes the boundaries for the form/states that govern what will or can become of matter, it is logically coherent to extrapolate that a black hole is the quantum particle converter of the base state of matter in its most fundamental form, recycling the foundational building blocks of the cosmos herself, like a digital pixel particle quantum ‘vacuum sun’ ultimately sustaining the vacuum state from out of which the gravitational state and light are sustained as merely emergent properties/phenomena of the vacuum state, arbitrated and sustained, by quantum physical particles. What is perceived as the vacuum state may in fact be a quantum ether of sorts. Now the kicker would be that as visible matter is recycled into its quantum birth state what is the mechanism by which the quantum state coalesces back into observable standard model particle physics. It may well be that there is in the future of knowledge a mechanism by which this takes place some sort of dark energy plasma or interaction or, is this the state into which the observable universe will decay? This, may explain why the universe is expanding to ultimately evaporate into a cosmic expansion of quantum particles who themselves will, when the material elements of suns have been entirely recycled into their base state, and there is no longer a frame of reference against which they themselves can expand, - will collapse into a single point of energy and rebirth a new cosmos? Or Not!

"A black hole's core forms from stellar explosion, but mass capture causes the black hole to rotate.  The rotation must cause the event horizon to rotate; this compels the fall of mass from the event horizon inward to be ""more"" tangential and less radial.  This reduces the condensate density of mass on the surface of the black hole compared to the core; it allows for evolutionary alloying crystalization from the surface inward, with accompanying piezoelectric consequences within ""the skin"".  The question becomes whether some black holes are spawned with enough gradual time before being swamped by mass imbibement, that they can develop such high spin rate, that the event horizon spin rate becomes high enough that the trajectory of infalling mass becomes radially tangential enough that a space gap is created between the black hole core and the later forming ""surface"" shell (""Dante's Inferno""?).  If so, such morphology would have a tremendous capacitance sufficient to act like a bug zapper upon mass approach within dielectric breakdown distance.

I have my own theory on how Galaxies and Black Holes came into existence. Feel free to correct me if you think I’m wrong. After the Big Bang explosion thousands of dark Super Vortexes were created. Acting like space Tornadoes attacking Space Matter. With no friction in space to impede their rotation they sped up at a tremendous rate. The huge Vortexes which we now call Black Holes in turn pulled in the surrounding space matter to form the spiraling Galaxies. Many scientists believe there is a black hole at the center of each Galaxy. My theory would also explain why all galaxies are spiral.,theory galaxy black hole came existence feel free correct think im wrong big bang explosion thousand dark super vortex created acting like space tornado attacking space matter friction space impede rotation sped tremendous rate huge vortex call black hole turn pulled surrounding space matter form spiraling galaxy many scientist believe black hole center galaxy theory would also explain galaxy spiral,1.0

"We all live in an Electron Universe without which Atoms could not exist. My vote is to study Electrons and Gluons which hold all the matter in the Universe Together. Black Holes are formed from 2 Neutron Stars coalescing at circa  >2.2sm. Neutron Stars are made of Neutrons. Electrons and Protons. When Neutron Stars form they eject all heavy elements like Gold Palladium Carbon etc. We see this in the stellar remnants of Neutron Stars. So from Neutrons Electrons and Protons Black Holes are made. There are therefor only 6 possible combinations of what a Black Hole is made of. Electrons and Protons can exist in Equilibrium. Electrons and Protons cannot exist in isolation, Neutrons cease to exist without Electrons or Protons. So Black Holes can only be Electrons and Protons in Equilibrium. This combination produces no Photons (light). It produces no Magnetic Entanglement which eliminates Black Hole Quakes. Both Neutron and Magnetar Stars produce magnetic field entanglement quakes. And Black Holes spin at speeds where normal matter would disintegrate. >90% LS. I like the Changeling Quark as it can become what Quark it likes. This Quark represents the Physics reason that there was probably no Anti Matter in the De Coupling event at the start of the matter Universe. The Changelings became what ever state suited the preservation of the Quark Universe. If 50% of quarks chose anti quark there would be no matter in the Universe. @ 49.9 / 50.1 there would be a Quark deprivation to form Up, Down and Changeling Quarks. The Expansion Theory in the Big Bang is not needed. If you think of a basketball size effervescent ball placed into a tank of water only the edge in contact with the water goes through a phase transition, or De Coupling. The Matter Universe came about from such a De Coupling. Therefore the Matter Universe could have developed by known Physics in the Scale Factor over a few billion years. This would also mean the Matter Universe came from a significant amount of Equilibrium Energy circa 6 Billion Light Year Diameter.

"I have a few ideas for possible solutions for dark matter/energy.  If they're wrong, would you mind telling me why?

Dark Matter solution (possibly?). What if the missing mass isn't from more atoms? Since interaction with the Higgs field is what gives things mass and that's due to subatomic particles. What if other places in the universe have higher numbers of subatomic particles per atom, or different ratios of subatomic particles that interact with the HIGGS field per atom? 

Could there be subatomic particles outside of atoms interacting with the higgs field, in a ""non-visible through radiation"" cloud in inter stellar/inter dimensional space, throwing all the models off? 

Alternatively, or additionally, is it possible for those subatomic particles to exist in the centers of the galaxies, or even black holes, without being contained in an atom?  Or, if there's missing mass in planets, perhaps it's in the center of them? 

Related to this, black holes are supposed to be infinitely dense because gravity crushes everything infinitely small once a run away density is reached, yet the argument underpinning the ""big bang"" is that matter was crushed to closely, which created too much heat and energy 

Another idea: what if something stretches, or HAS stretched the HIGGS field, particularly if it happens unevenly, and thus differing interactions with it we see as gravity ""not working"" are just stretched in the Higgs field, like gravity warps space time?  
Also: If we don't have an explanation for uneven stretching in our universe, could it be from something occuring in the other dimensions predicted by string theory? I've also long wondered if some of the ""missing"" impact of gravity that I've been told happens, is due to it being stretched acroas multiple dimensions, perhaps some ""dark matter"" is this gravity bleeding back over from other parallel dimensions, possibly with the Higgs field as an intermediary somehow????",idea possible solution dark matterenergy theyre wrong would mind telling dark matter solution possibly missing mass isnt atom since interaction higgs field give thing mass thats due subatomic particle place universe higher number subatomic particle per atom different ratio subatomic particle interact higgs field per atom could subatomic particle outside atom interacting higgs field nonvisible radiation cloud inter stellarinter dimensional space throwing model alternatively additionally possible subatomic particle exist center galaxy even black hole without contained atom there missing mass planet perhaps center related black hole supposed infinitely dense gravity crush everything infinitely small run away density reached yet argument underpinning big bang matter crushed closely created much heat energy another idea something stretch stretched higgs field particularly happens unevenly thus differing interaction see gravity working stretched higgs field like gravity warp space time also dont explanation uneven stretching universe could something occuring dimension predicted string theory ive also long wondered missing impact gravity ive told happens due stretched acroas multiple dimension perhaps dark matter gravity bleeding back parallel dimension possibly higgs field intermediary somehow,1.0

Which means that from your perspective you would see everything speed by in a flash and then you would just as suddenly cease to exist since the black hole evaporated.

We also know that the speed of light is constant and as we approach speed of light room-space warps (if I have understood it correctly).

Likewise, the universe is known to be expanding and the process is actually accelerating. Most scientists tend to attribute this to dark energy, yet we have no real idea of what it is. What if the expansion and acceleration of the universe is a byproduct of an externality of which we are yet unaware, similar to how we think of mass constantly being swallowed by the increasing force of a black hole’s gravity? For every action, an equal and opposite reaction?

As for seeing the manifestation of black holes in our own ‘reality,’ what if nature/physics/foundational principles are fundamentally recursive? If considered in this way, any expression of time/history takes on a new dimension and is relative based on any attempted observation along the recursive spectrum.

See people we are giving a space our time values but rather to acknowledge more to human that in space universe is a that probability where we know that their is no stop value but knowing in earth where time stop for momentum than see because earth has a thermal process going with time when temperature is low so most of part in earh are like freeze its nature of living but when high temperature value comes its again has changes going like melt or freeze or freeze or melt but in space no freeze no melt no stop to move or put any mass of bodie in one criteria but space where everything mass of bodie is moving freely because they have a surface to move in that surfaces of values without any stop so see we can't give a value with time in space on earth time has value to stop either see any creature they have a value to live in life cycle in time of values that how much that life can be live in that projected of time but in space their is no time to project that bodie mass in which time it will stop to move or in which time it's time like as creatures on earth that it will die so see we are giving our time values that time values which comes in life once a period to stop but in space no period in any life of mass bodie which can stop its nature we see star has probability to die how can star die no it can't see star which to known as star loose his charge values so then star moves to another surface and another surface gives another values to star particles to bond its nature to that surface because if star loose it charges so that surface has no value to bond its nature then in space other surface or any surface they have different state of nature to collide a substances in space see in earth times has probability to stop for momentum but in space no momentum is to find that rotation is going to stop so see time has different values in space rather its only work with space when we gives a any mass bodie a pressure of force to move in direction which direction is like to calculate a time or distance with speed only than time works for bodie to move in that velocity of time of speed of that mass of bodie either space their is no such value that time stop for a moment in space but in earth time to time changes going and time to time values coming and time to time life begin or end but in space no end only we see how life is going and if we something new in space so we set that thing with time and then we give time value see space has its nature what you see or what not it depend on space nature and then your time values of mechanism which having a work procedure with time either see we don't know how life begin in space but we know in earth how life is begin or going for end so time matter mostly in earth either giving time values to space if we know how space begin so on that time we give a value of time in space knowing begin or end if space has no end so how time is working time only works in beginning or end but space has no end or no beginning so time we giving to space is not a proper value of time only time which is proper is knowing that what we send to space a bodie of any mechanism so that mechanism has time value to evolve it with space but when time values comes in end to that mechanism so time only matter for that mechanism or speed or mass rather time has no value in space because in space no end no beginning ok,see people giving space time value rather acknowledge human space universe probability know stop value knowing earth time stop momentum see earth thermal process going time temperature low part earh like freeze nature living high temperature value come change going like melt freeze freeze melt space freeze melt stop move put mass bodie one criterion space everything mass bodie moving freely surface move surface value without stop see cant give value time space earth time value stop either see creature value live life cycle time value much life live projected time space time project bodie mass time stop move time time like creature earth die see giving time value time value come life period stop space period life mass bodie stop nature see star probability die star die cant see star known star loose charge value star move another surface another surface give another value star particle bond nature surface star loose charge surface value bond nature space surface surface different state nature collide substance space see earth time probability stop momentum space momentum find rotation going stop see time different value space rather work space give mass bodie pressure force move direction direction like calculate time distance speed time work bodie move velocity time speed mass bodie either space value time stop moment space earth time time change going time time value coming time time life begin end space end see life going something new space set thing time give time value see space nature see depend space nature time value mechanism work procedure time either see dont

It just lines up too well for me that the universe springs out of the explosion this supposedly infinitely dense point which seems to then ultimately swallow itself up back into this infinitely dense point.

I imagine this as sort of a continuous pulse or sine-wave like process that's infinitely exploding outwards before contracting to the point where it essentially inverts itself and expands back out.
Or doesn't so much expand back out as much as it contracts to the point to which it inverts itself and in a way doesn't really expand back out as much as it continues to contract - but in the opposite direction :P

Expansion and contraction becomes indistinguishable.. Just at one point one becomes the other, even though the process or the forces applied haven't actually really changed direction or anything like that.

I imagine this is as a motion that has always been ongoing and always will.
There is nothing that could or would have at some point set all this into motion..

"In my opinion,

I really thing these black holes are nothing but stars with no light.
Makes sense right?

Now how does it makes sense it makes sense because if stars had not light they would be black ofcourse, because dark is the absence of light, therefore just because they have abnormal types of rings that stars don't have in my theory black holes have those rings of fire like light black holes are another types of stars with alot more mass and with rings, and in my opinion those rings are another stars being stretched out and its there particals thay are the rings.

Now look we cannot go into a black hole because it has alot of mass and it stretches things out and even if we managed to go in one, we would experience dark like full dark.

Now main thing is ever saw a blackhole collision?
See in black hole collisions the black holes are stretches out each other and this is why they create a abnormal sound, and other theories are just cartoonish. Like how in the world can black hole be a portal, like yeah there is a chance but my theory makes sense because i'm trying to say is black holes are made for controlling our universe and they eat stars so our universe doesn't become over populated with stars or planets, the main thing is why black holes suck everythingis because they don't suck,they actually have a strong gravitational pole, and thats the reason.

Maybe this should have changed your mind but, there is always a but, the main thing is that black holes are made to control the growth of our universe and the reason they are black and have rings is cuz they are stars with no light and with strong gravity, and therefore we can never get into a black hole😊 and we are basically orbiting a black hole too, like we are orbiting a sun and all the stars are orbiting a black hole.

Maybe black holes are boss level stars.🤔

"I've got an important point about light and black holes seen on our own sun, called sunspots.  The sun produces black spots on the sun.  Does that mean our sun's gravity increases locally around those sunspots so the light can no longer escape?  No.  The energy radiating from those locations increase while the wavelength of light shortens to the point where optical telescopes can't see it.  Hence why the solar wind increases drastically radiating from sunspots.  The light is still there because radio telescopes are able to see the high energy photons radiating from sunspots, magnetic fields.  

The same thing then must also be true for black holes.  They produce the high energy photons so optical telescopes like Hubble can't see it.  But point a radio or infrared telescope at the massive star and it will stick out like a sore thumb in high energy short wavelength light. That's exactly what radio telescope see.  They detect massive amounts of high energy photons, but no visible light.  Their entire surface has become one massive sunspot, radiating a high energy invisible solar wind.  The entire black hole would be black to optical telescopes, just like the sunspots on a star.  

The entire idea that the gravity of a black hole is so strong that not even light can escape can't be proven.  But sunspots have been observed on our sun for a long time, so they can be proven.

If the black hole is constantly spewing a rapid high energy invisible solar wind then what would we expect to observe around a black hole?  Well, we'd see everything moving away from it instead of falling into it.  Nothing would be able to penetrate such a fast energetic wind ripping from it's surface.  And sure enough, radio telescopes measure what called a high velocity dispersion of matter in galaxies.  All the stars and other objects move rapidly away from the black hole instead of falling into them.  Black holes should create pairs of particles just like the sun does in it's solar wind.  The youngest stars in the galaxy then would be born close to the black hole while constantly migrating away.  And this too was observed by many different sky surveys.  They discovered our own solar system is receding away from the central core at nearly 900,000 mi/h.  The receding motion of matter in galaxies contradicts theories and the cosmological model of the universe, from how it formed to the point we're at today.",ive got important point light black hole seen sun called sunspot sun produce black spot sun mean sun gravity increase locally around sunspot light longer escape energy radiating location increase wavelength light shortens point optical telescope cant see hence solar wind increase drastically radiating sunspot light still radio telescope able see high energy photon radiating sunspot magnetic field thing must also true black hole produce high energy photon optical telescope like hubble cant see point radio infrared telescope massive star stick like sore thumb high energy short wavelength light thats exactly radio telescope see detect massive amount high energy photon visible light entire surface become one massive sunspot radiating high energy invisible solar wind entire black hole would black optical telescope like sunspot star entire idea gravity black hole strong even light escape cant proven sunspot observed sun long time proven black hole constantly spewing rapid high energy invisible solar wind would expect observe around black hole well wed see everything moving away instead falling nothing would able penetrate fast energetic wind ripping surface sure enough radio telescope measure called high velocity dispersion matter galaxy star object move rapidly away black hole instead falling black hole create pair particle like sun solar wind youngest star galaxy would born close black hole constantly migrating away observed many different sky survey discovered solar system receding away central core nearly mih receding motion matter galaxy contradicts theory cosmological model universe formed point today,1.0
"The reason why general relativity and quantum mechanics is unable to merge is because Einstein's equations are missing a very important variable, the action responsible.  Sure his theory and the laws of motion are able to accurately describe and predict the orbit and velocity of planets such and Pluto, Venus and even Earth but fail miserably when trying to explain and predict the motion of the rest of the stars and galaxies in the universe.  Their theories are only able to explain the motion and velocities of an estimated 4.6% of all the visible matter in the universe.  The remaining 95.4% of the motion occurring goes unanswered, so they blame it on dark matter or dark energy.  The unexplained motion is empirical evidence Einstein and Newton's equations are incomplete.  Thus finish Einstein's and Newton's equations and they'll be able to do it.  Until then they'll be lost.

Who here knows what the action is that causes matter in the vacuum of space to move towards other matter?  Remember, if gravity (motion) is the reaction then what's the action responsible?

Not even Einstein knew what's causing matter to be attracted.  That's why his equations are considered incomplete.  Until they are revised to include the action responsible the two theories will never merge.  Einstein's field equations on gravity don't even agree with James Maxwell's equations on electromagnetic fields (light).

I believe I know how to revise his equations to accurately describe and predict the orbits and velocities of all matter in the universe, even the motion blamed on dark matter and dark energy.  I published several books on the subject.  The revised equations even go as far as explaining why the galaxies in the distant universe are so old and massive, some further than 13 billion light years away are more than 20 times the size of our own Milky Way galaxy.

In the first paperback book published almost a year before the JWST published the first survey, on page 48 I wrote quote, ""The JWST, James Webb Space Telescope will discover old, fully grown galaxies as far as the telescope can see, further than 13.8 billion light years away.""  Thus I'm pretty sure the revisions I did to their field equations on motion and gravity are correct.  I was the only theoretical astrophysicist who accurately predicted old fully grown galaxies in the distant universe.  Astronomers are still scratching their heads at to why and I accurately predicted them almost a year before they discovered I was right.  The predictions didn't end there.  The revised equations also predict many things about black holes, white holes, wormholes, the universe and much more they've yet to discover.  Like the revisions predict satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way do so on a completely different plane than the stars orbiting the galaxy disk.  We will have to wait and see.  I published the books back in 2021, before NASA launched the JWST.  So, it's not like I'm claiming these things after the facts were discovered.  The JWST didn't release the CEERS survey till June of 2022, almost a year after I published the books.  What gets me is none of the so called experts have yet to figure out why relativity and the model of the universe is incomplete.

If time stops at the event horizon of a black hole, then what happens when you go (hypothetically) past the event horizon, closer to the centre of the black hole? Could it be that a black hole is uniform past the event horizon, without change inside it because there is no time there? Then again, is it appropriate to think about what exists within a black hole – does existence have meaning in the absence of time?",im surprised hear suggestion time space fundamental given relative absolute find intriguing relationship concept like black hole gravity mass time space causality certainty time stop event horizon black hole happens go hypothetically past event horizon closer centre black hole could black hole uniform past event horizon without change inside time appropriate think exists within black hole existence meaning absence time,1.0

"Regarding the nature of spacetime, we talk about it as though it is a fabric and make it a two dimensional fabric that mass distorts like a weighted ball on the fabric surface of a trampoline. That leads us to think it has other properties of fabric and of course it is 4 dimensional instead of two dimensional (three dimensions plus time instead of the two dimensions of the fabric on a trampoline). We never really consider the thickness, but if theories of the big bang where all the universe was compressed into the space smaller than an atom then why didn't that enormous accumulation of mass instantly create the biggest black hole of all made up of all the matter in the universe? The fact that it clearly didn't suggests when you compress space time as a whole down to such small sizes that perhaps a black hole or body of immense gravity simply can't be formed because space time is so thick and it is only the expansion of space time that has allowed it to thin out to the point where holes in the material can be created. This is not good because it suggests that as the universe continues to expand the threshold for creating a black hole might get lower and lower and all remaining matter might fall out of this universe. A singularity is a point of infinite gravity where matter is crushed out of existence. A neutron star is where electrons and protons are crushed down together into neutrons with no empty space that most atoms are largely made from. The next step would be crushing the neutrons down to what? Some other subatomic particle? Photons? Maybe it is converted to energy and that is the Hawkins radiation that is emitted over time? Certainly a very interesting thing to think about.",regarding nature spacetime talk though fabric make two dimensional fabric mass distorts like weighted ball fabric surface trampoline lead u think property fabric course dimensional instead two dimensional three dimension plus time instead two dimension fabric trampoline never really consider thickness theory big bang universe compressed space smaller atom didnt enormous accumulation mass instantly create biggest black hole made matter universe fact clearly didnt suggests compress space time whole small size perhaps black hole body immense gravity simply cant formed space time thick expansion space time allowed thin point hole material created good suggests universe continues expand threshold creating black hole might get lower lower remaining matter might fall universe singularity point infinite gravity matter crushed existence neutron star electron proton crushed together neutron empty space atom largely made next step would crushing neutron subatomic particle photon maybe converted energy hawkins radiation emitted time certainly interesting thing think,1.0

"This was a fascinating video. I have a few questions. How do we know a black hole is a singularity? If when mass is added, does its gravitational pull change? I would assume that the event horizon grows. This means that even though the information crossed the horizon, its mass information is still being relayed past the horizon. And if mass is just energy, then no information has been lost. And if we can tell the mass of a black hole that would suggest it isn't a singularity. A singularity would mean it has infinite gravity. But it just has more pull than the speed of light/causality as we know it. Would that mean the information of gravity travels faster than light? Gravitational waves suggest not. So does gravity carry any information? And if time and space swap at the horizon. Would that mean that all gravity is an emerganitive property of time pulling on the fabric of space? If you stop time, gravity wouldn't matter. Nothing would move, and you would be at a zero energy state. But once you add time, it acts upon space. Disturbing it. Pushing space out of the way to put mass. Could gravity be emerging by displacing space, causing negative space energy. Similar to the Casimir effect. The more mass, the more negative space created. They would intertwine like a mixture. Till you reach a point were the gravity has become so great that space can not fill the area between particals and you create a black hole. The absence of space. The plank length is very small so the gravity would need to be very high. I hope this makes any sense to anyone.

Monad (from Greek μονάς monas, ""singularity"" in turn from μόνος monos, ""alone"") refers, in cosmogony, to the Supreme Being, divinity or the totality of all things. 

The concept was reportedly conceived by the Pythagoreans and may refer variously to a single source acting alone, or to an indivisible origin, or to both.

The concept was later adopted by other philosophers, such as Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, who referred to the Monad as an *elementary particle.*
 
It had a *geometric counterpart,* which was debated and discussed contemporaneously by the same groups of people. 

[In this speculative scenario, let's consider Leibniz's *Monad,* from the philosophical work ""The Monadology"", as an abstract representation of *the zero-dimensional space that binds quarks together* using the strong nuclear force]:

1) Indivisibility and Unity: Monads, as indivisible entities, mirror the nature of quarks, which are deemed elementary and indivisible particles in our theoretical context. Just as monads possess unity and indivisibility, quarks are unified in their interactions through the strong force.

2) Interconnectedness: Leibniz's monads are interconnected, each reflecting the entire universe from its own perspective. In a parallel manner, the interconnectedness of quarks through the strong force could be metaphorically represented by the interplay of monads, forming a web that holds particles together.

3) Inherent Properties: Just as monads possess inherent perceptions and appetitions, quarks could be thought of as having intrinsic properties like color charge, reflecting the inherent qualities of monads and influencing their interactions.

4) Harmony: The concept of monads contributing to universal harmony resonates with the idea that the strong nuclear force maintains harmony within atomic nuclei by counteracting the electromagnetic repulsion between protons, allowing for the stability of matter.

5) Pre-established Harmony: Monads' pre-established harmony aligns with the idea that the strong force was pre-designed to ensure stable interactions among quarks, orchestrating their behavior in a way that parallels the harmony envisaged by Leibniz.

6) Non-Mechanical Interaction: Monads interact non-mechanically, mirroring the non-mechanical interactions of quarks through gluon exchange. This connection might be seen as a metaphorical reflection of the intricacies of quark-gluon dynamics.

7) Holism: The holistic perspective of monads could symbolize how quarks, like the monads' interconnections, contribute holistically to the structure and behavior of particles through the strong force interactions.",monad black hole monad greek mona singularity turn mono alone refers cosmogony supreme divinity totality thing concept reportedly conceived pythagoreans may refer variously single source acting alone indivisible origin concept later adopted philosopher gottfried wilhelm leibniz referred monad elementary particle geometric counterpart debated discussed contemporaneously group people speculative scenario let consider leibniz monad philosophical work monadology abstract representation zerodimensional space bind quark together using strong nuclear force indivisibility unity monad indivisible entity mirror nature quark deemed elementary indivisible particle theoretical context monad possess unity indivisibility quark unified interaction strong force interconnectedness leibniz monad interconnected reflecting entire universe perspective parallel manner interconnectedness quark strong force could metaphorically represented interplay monad forming web hold particle together inherent property monad possess inherent perception appetitions quark could thought intrinsic property like color charge reflecting inherent quality monad influencing interaction harmony concept monad contributing universal harmony resonates idea strong nuclear force maintains harmony within atomic nucleus counteracting electromagnetic repulsion proton allowing stability matter preestablished harmony monad preestablished harmony aligns idea strong force predesigned ensure stable interaction among quark orchestrating behavior way parallel harmony envisaged leibniz nonmechanical interaction monad interact nonmechanically mirroring nonmechanical interaction quark gluon exchange connection might seen metaphorical reflection intricacy quarkgluon dynamic holism holistic perspective monad could symbolize quark like monad interconnection contribute holistically structure behavior particle strong force interaction,1.0

"I’ve been saying since 2013 that it seems extremely (Occam's Razor) obvious that all electrons and all photons are in orbit with a dark matter particle and I’ve shared my theory literally many thousands of times with hundreds of the world’s top physics universities, professors, labs, channels, etc.

Based on Fermilab, CERN and other recent findings, I now more specifically think electrons are made of an electron neutrino entangled in orbit with a dark matter muon neutrino, explaining their erratic orbits around nuclei, superposition, uncertainty, the double slit, etc just like I’ve been saying since 2013.  And I think when the electron neutrino gets entangled with the muon neutrino it creates the Higgs field.

I think when an electron gets a 2nd muon neutrino, it’s what we call a Tau particle and I think photons are a pair of electrons entangled in orbit together in apparent axial or helical polarizable wave-like movement depending on the direction of their rotation as they travel.  This explains the double slit experiment for example and the speed of the rotation explains electromagnetic wavelengths.

I also think protons and neutrons are actually made up of over 1,800 electrons with the muon neutrinos likely all clustered in the center surrounded by the same number of electron neutrinos.

"The idea of a ‘singularity’ is ridiculous IMO.  
Do most physicists agree that black holes are simply super dense spheres of mass not unlike neutron stars whose neutrons are touching neutrons with no apparent motion, black holes have another level of gravity and density that has the quarks and gluons pressed together with no remaining apparent motion or vibrations at all that have become dense enough that their event horizon diameter exceeds the sphere’s diameter, going black from our view?

I think Einstein's wrong, that time is constant and that dark matter is the limiting factor to the speed of light.  I think it’s not 'space-time' bending but rather gravitational and dark matter density variations.",idea singularity ridiculous imo physicist agree black hole simply super dense sphere mass unlike neutron star whose neutron touching neutron apparent motion black hole another level gravity density quark gluon pressed together remaining apparent motion vibration become dense enough event horizon diameter exceeds sphere diameter going black view think einstein wrong time constant dark matter limiting factor speed light think spacetime bending rather gravitational dark matter density variation,1.0

"I am delivering a sermon to you 🙏😊 please read

Consistently Pray for forgiveness, guidance in a good (positive) direction, and for help against evil. Pray to be saved from hell  (whatever that may be). Pray for your friends and your family too, it only takes a minute or so/less at a time to pray. Do it and your life will slowly get better, or maybe quickly. It probably just depends on you and the kind of person you are/have been. Don't wait until its too late and you have to suffer the consequences of built up bad karma from immoral acts/unrepented sins. Maybe together we can help make the world a better place by changing ourselves for the better, and changing things around us for the better.
And addressing/thanking the CREATOR OF THE UNIVERSE, LORD GOD at the beginning and end of your prayers would be a good idea.
Be my friend and I will pray for you, but I do not know how much help me doing so will give you. You should try to practice daily prayer yourself.
I'm trying to help you get right with the LORD 🙏

Amen.

I have worded a short prayer for you to say if you are not sure what words to use, it may not be the best but here it is 😊

"Exceptional presentation by Mr Cox.
I have though and being saying for some time the the concept of Space-Time is flawed. By that meaning that something underlying is missing from Space-Time, something that space-time is guided by or built upon. Some hints of this are in the theoretic flipping of space time in/at the event horizon of a singularity. I believe this flipping (Or swapping places) can also occur under other conditions not directly related to a black hole. So it was a reassuring affirmation to see this stated by Mr Cox :)
>
Second, I question the assertion that we cannot peer into a black hole. I think this assertion is flawed. In the circumstance under the correct conditions where the gravity between 2 binary black holes in close proximity there is a high likelihood that the gravity of the 2 singularities would cancel out the gravity at and below the event horizon basically disrupting the event horizon (Think Lagrangian points). During this disruption before the 2 singularities merge the fundamental internal ""stuff"" of a black hole may have the opportunity to escape at least as far as the Lagrange point, if not even further. We should be able to view this or measure it in some way giving us a glimpse of what comes out. There is the risk that what emerges, no longer effected by the terminal gravity well may change back to a state that is compatible with the external space time, and may not truly reflect the internal state, but I am sure it would offer up some worthwhile hints :)",exceptional presentation mr cox though saying time concept spacetime flawed meaning something underlying missing spacetime something spacetime guided built upon hint theoretic flipping space time inat event horizon singularity believe flipping swapping place also occur condition directly related black hole reassuring affirmation see stated mr cox second question assertion peer black hole think assertion flawed circumstance correct condition gravity binary black hole close proximity high likelihood gravity singularity would cancel gravity event horizon basically disrupting event horizon think lagrangian point disruption singularity merge fundamental internal stuff black hole may opportunity escape least far lagrange point even able view measure way giving u glimpse come risk emerges longer effected terminal gravity well may change back state compatible external space time may truly reflect internal state sure would offer worthwhile hint,1.0

"So called scientific studies are 99.99% bologna.  First.  Scientists do not understand what's causing gravity, let along accurately predict what happens near them.  

As an example, take the observations by the HST in 2010 of a large spherically shaped gas cloud G02 heading straight for the supermassive black hole in the center of our galaxy.  Scientists using the equations of Newton and Einstein determined the cloud of gas would be stretched out like a spaghetti noodle to which they termed spaghettification.  They then predicted some of the gas would fall into the black hole and produce a ""light show"" as gas goes nuclear when reaching the speed of light.  Because gas doesn't have much mass it can't produce angular momentum.  So it would not be able to orbit the black hole but instead, head right straight for it in a beeline.

Then 4 years later in 2014 they witnessed the gas cloud exit out from behind the black hole.  It was barely affected.  It retained it's spherical shape.  It wasn't spaghettified, none of the gas was stretched out like a noodle and it passed by the black hole as if it was trying to stay away from it.  It didn't produce a light show because none of the gas fell in.

Every one of the predictions made by the experts studying G02 back in 2010 was wrong.

Then because the gas cloud was unaffected by the gravity of the black hole they assumed there had to be much more mass in the gas cloud than they imagined.  How else would it be able to pass by the black hole so close without being torn apart?  They reported that the gas cloud must have contained a few small stars they were unable to see, hidden in the gas.  They then began studying the infrared telescope data on the black hole.  They were unable to find any stars hiding in it.

As you know, infrared telescopes detect heat.  So, if there was a few stars hiding in the gas cloud, then they would produce a massive hot spot in the cold gas.  they went over the data and there was no stars hiding in the gas.  Still to this day they can't explain within reason why the predictions made by experts in their field of study were completely wrong.

To this day they have no idea why the G02 gas cloud was not spaghettified or why it didn't fall into the black hole.  Simply put, how can experts claim to understand what happens near a black hole if their equations can't predict any of the observations?",called scientific study bologna first scientist understand whats causing gravity let along accurately predict happens near example take observation hst large spherically shaped gas cloud g heading straight supermassive black hole center galaxy scientist using equation newton einstein determined cloud gas would stretched like spaghetti noodle termed spaghettification predicted gas would fall black hole produce light show gas go nuclear reaching speed light gas doesnt much mass cant produce angular momentum would able orbit black hole instead head right straight beeline year later witnessed gas cloud exit behind black hole barely affected retained spherical shape wasnt spaghettified none gas stretched like noodle passed black hole trying stay away didnt produce light show none gas fell every one prediction made expert studying g back wrong gas cloud unaffected gravity black hole assumed much mass gas cloud imagined else would able pas black hole close without torn apart reported gas cloud must contained small star unable see hidden gas began studying infrared telescope data black hole unable find star hiding know infrared telescope detect heat star hiding gas cloud would produce massive hot spot cold gas went data star hiding gas still day cant explain within reason prediction made expert field study completely wrong day idea g gas cloud spaghettified didnt fall black hole simply put expert claim understand happens near black hole equation cant predict observation,1.0

"No, black holes do not erase information from the universe.  They are the creators of information throughout the universe.

The black hole paradox arises when assuming that nothing can escape them.  Their theories and models of nature are wrong.  Supermassive black holes are the God like creators of all things.  They are massive, they are infinitely dense, produce the most gravity, the most energy, the most information.  The only reason why scientists came up with the information paradox was because if nothing is able to escape the gravity of a black hole then they would be considered eternal.  And only God is eternal.  So Hawking proposed maybe the gravity of the black hole was producing virtual particles just outside it's event horizon, allowing particles to escape, so black holes would not appear to be eternal, always existing.

Nothing can fall into a black hole and be destroyed.  Why would nature do that?

The answer to a theory of everything can only start with OVER-UNITY of energy.  It's the only explanation for nature and the universe, from the beginning right up to today.",black hole erase information universe creator information throughout universe black hole paradox arises assuming nothing escape theory model nature wrong supermassive black hole god like creator thing massive infinitely dense produce gravity energy information reason scientist came information paradox nothing able escape gravity black hole would considered eternal god eternal hawking proposed maybe gravity black hole producing virtual particle outside event horizon allowing particle escape black hole would appear eternal always existing nothing fall black hole destroyed would nature answer theory everything start overunity energy explanation nature universe beginning right today,1.0

"Black holes, like vinyl records of the universe, hold encoded information waiting to be retrieved. This is how it appears to work.
In the context of the Quantum Information Hypothesis (QIH) theory. let's imagine a black hole as a massive vinyl record and delve deeper into how the holographic screen is akin to the speakers on a record player. The holographic screen represents the mysterious boundary of the black hole, and just like the speakers on a record player produce sound, the holographic screen contains encoded information about the black hole's properties. Here's how it works:

    Holographic Screen as Speakers: In the analogy, we consider the holographic screen surrounding the black hole to be analogous to the speakers on a record player. When we play a vinyl record, the sound is produced by the vibrations of the record's grooves. Similarly, the holographic screen stores information encoded on the black hole's boundary (the photon sphere) in the form of probability wave functions. This stored information can be thought of as ""sound"" in the context of the analogy.
    Information Retrieval through hf=mc^2 - The Lock and Key: In the QIH framework, the famous equation E=mc^2 takes on a new meaning. The energy (E) of the Hawking radiation photons is proportional to their frequency (f), and this energy can be related to the information encoded on the holographic screen. Much like a lock and key mechanism, the photons' frequencies (the key) act as a tool to unlock the encoded information (the lock) on the holographic screen. In this way, the equation hf=mc^2 plays a crucial role in retrieving the encoded information from the photon sphere.
    Interaction and Decoding: As Hawking radiation interacts with the bumpy surface of the photon sphere, it ""reads"" the encoded information stored on the holographic screen. The radiation acts like a ""needle"" on the record player, picking up the subtle details and patterns imprinted in the grooves of the photon sphere. The information read from the holographic screen contains probabilities of finding particles with specific properties, such as velocity, acceleration, and other characteristics.
    Inferring Probability of 0 and 1, Velocity, and Acceleration: The interaction between Hawking radiation and the photon sphere allows scientists to infer the probabilities of finding particles with different properties. These probabilities are akin to the ""0s"" and ""1s"" in quantum information theory, representing the likelihood of a particular particle having a specific property. Additionally, the information gathered from the holographic screen provides insights into the velocity, acceleration, and other characteristics of the particles that have fallen into the black hole.
    Understanding the Black Hole's Contents and Gravity: By studying the information read from the holographic screen, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of what lies within the black hole. The holographic screen serves as a repository of data about the particles that have entered the black hole, effectively ""playing back"" the history and properties of these particles. Moreover, the information gathered through hf=mc^2 and the interaction with the holographic screen contributes to our understanding of gravity and how it manifests within the black hole.

In summary, the holographic screen, like the speakers on a record player, acts as a ""speaker"" of the encoded information from the black hole's boundary. The application of hf=mc^2, akin to a lock and key mechanism, allows scientists to retrieve information from the photon sphere, which gives insights into probabilities, velocity, acceleration, and gravity within the black hole. Through this innovative approach, researchers are uncovering profound connections between quantum mechanics, gravity, and information theory, paving the way for deeper insights into the nature of black holes and the universe itself.",black hole like vinyl record universe hold encoded information waiting retrieved appears work context quantum information hypothesis qih theory let imagine black hole massive vinyl record delve deeper holographic screen akin speaker record player holographic screen represents mysterious boundary black hole like speaker record player produce sound holographic screen contains encoded information black hole property here work holographic screen speaker analogy consider holographic screen surrounding black hole analogous speaker record player play vinyl record sound produced vibration record groove similarly holographic screen store information encoded black hole boundary photon sphere form probability wave function stored information thought sound context analogy information retrieval hfmc lock key qih framework famous equation emc take new meaning energy e hawking radiation photon proportional frequency f energy related information encoded holographic screen much like lock key mechanism photon frequency key act tool unlock encoded information lock holographic screen way equation hfmc play crucial role retrieving encoded information photon sphere interaction decoding hawking radiation interacts bumpy surface photon sphere read encoded information stored holographic screen radiation act like needle record player picking subtle detail pattern imprinted groove photon sphere information read holographic screen contains probability finding particle specific property velocity acceleration characteristic inferring probability velocity acceleration interaction hawking radiation photon sphere allows scientist infer probability finding particle different property probability akin quantum information theory representing likelihood particular particle specific property additionally information gathered holographic screen provides insight velocity acceleration characteristic particle fallen black hole understanding black hole content gravity studying information read holographic screen scientist gain deeper understanding lie within black hole holographic screen serf repository data particle entered black hole effectively playing back history property particle moreover information gathered hfmc interaction holographic screen contributes understanding gravity manifest within black hole summary holographic screen like speaker record player act speaker encoded information black hole boundary application hfmc akin lock key mechanism allows scientist retrieve information photon sphere give insight probability velocity acceleration gravity within black hole innovative approach researcher uncovering profound connection quantum mechanic gravity information theory paving way deeper insight nature black hole universe,1.0

"technically black holes could be 'hyperholes' where the dimensions break down into unity - like a hypersphere or hypercube, meaning, they'd be nothing but a 'flat disk' from any dimensional angle, as well as a sphere. I also think 'octave black holes' are possible - a universe with black holes in a black hole in a universe of black holes in a black hole.. Which given my first theory implies the 'hyper universe' which would be definitively 'disk flat' and spherical, as the perimeter of any black hole. I also believe it's possible this could explain lending errors in astrophysics, local big bangs, which though a thing, could also be 'inert' and not 'catastrophic' as science implies, and explain local, universal expansion - and also contraction - dependent on the black holes environment the local universe is in.",technically black hole could hyperholes dimension break unity like hypersphere hypercube meaning theyd nothing flat disk dimensional angle well sphere also think octave black hole possible universe black hole black hole universe black hole black hole given first theory implies hyper universe would definitively disk flat spherical perimeter black hole also believe possible could explain lending error astrophysics local big bang though thing could also inert catastrophic science implies explain local universal expansion also contraction dependent black hole environment local universe,1.0
"What a Proton is, and how it is a holographic projection from a black hole through Quantum Information holography which conforms with AdSCFT correspondence.. In normal and detailed terms.
Normal terms:
In the expansive canvas of the universe, a mystical dance of light particles, called photons, unfolds. Each photon, though separated by vast distances from its partners, is bound by an unseen force. This force, a tether of light (a wormhole), stretches and flexes, but never breaks, ensuring that the fates of these particles remain intertwined. This is the magic of ""entanglement.""
Imagine two ballet dancers on a grand stage. Though they might be far apart, a rubber band of light (a wormhole) connects them. When one leaps, the other responds instantly, as if the light band tugged at her. No matter their distance, their dance remains in perfect harmony, echoing the enigmatic dance of entangled photons.
There's a lighthouse (the singularity where light constructively converges onto one single qubit), mighty and proud, casting its beams into the vast abyss (the interference pattern of the superposition of all possible states at the singularity which is one planck qubit). Yet, this is no ordinary light. It paints upon the cosmic canvas of ""spacetime."" Each radiant stroke leaves a shadow, an echo, on this universal fabric. This intricate play of light and shadow is at the heart of Quantum Information Holography (QIH).
Enter Hydrogen, our universe's protagonist. Simple in structure, with just a proton and an electron, it moves in a delicate waltz. The proton, our star performer, carries within it smaller dancers named quarks and gluons. Their rhythm, their synchrony, isn't accidental. The cosmic rubber band of entanglement dictates their steps, ensuring perfect harmony.
But how do we witness this celestial ballet? Picture a grand theater. Every performance, each twirl and spin, is projected onto the majestic drapes that encircle the stage. These curtains, vast and ethereal, hold the secrets of the cosmos. Through QIH's lens, this boundary is a keeper of tales, echoing every dance move, every whisper of an electron, every sigh of a quark.
Journeying beyond Hydrogen, we encounter a diverse ensemble – helium, carbon, oxygen, and more. Each element, with its unique set of dancers and choreographies, reveals deeper layers of entanglement. Their graceful complexity, their very essence, is a testament to the universe's interconnected web of light and energy.
In the end, the universe's story, as woven by QIH, isn't merely about particles in motion. It's a poetic saga of bonds unbroken, of light particles in ceaseless harmony, and of a grand theater that remembers and echoes every dance. Through this lens, every atom, every element, becomes a chapter in the eternal dance of entanglement, unfolding on the holographic stage of reality.
Detailed terms:
Consider the quantum state of two entangled photons:
∣Ψ⟩=12(∣0⟩A∣1⟩B−∣1⟩A∣0⟩B)∣Ψ⟩=2
​1​(∣0⟩A​∣1⟩B​−∣1⟩A​∣0⟩B​)
Here, the photons, denoted as A and B, are in a superposition such that if photon A is measured in state ∣0⟩, photon B will instantly be in state ∣1⟩, and vice versa, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This represents the ballet dancers' entangled dance.
In the realm of QIH, the spacetime fabric can be modeled using the AdS/CFT correspondence. This posits that a gravitational theory in an ""AdS"" space (Anti-de Sitter space) is equivalent to a boundary quantum field theory in a ""CFT"" space (Conformal Field Theory). 
Mathematically:
ZAdS​[g]=⟨e−SCFT​[Φ]⟩
Where ZAdS​ is the partition function in the bulk, and SCFT​ represents the action in the boundary theory.
Now, considering the hydrogen atom within QIH, the proton and electron's bound state can be viewed in terms of entangled quantum states. The proton, comprising quarks q and gluons g, is described by:
∣p⟩=∫d3kψ(k)∣3q,g,k⟩
The wave function ψ(k) captures the behavior of quarks and gluons within the proton, with k being the momentum space representation.
The binding of the electron e to the proton can be described by the hydrogen wave function:
∣H⟩=∫d3xχ(x)∣e,p,x⟩
Where χ(x) represents the spatial distribution of the electron relative to the proton.
Moving up the periodic table, the increased mass and complexity of elements can be seen as a result of more intricate quantum entanglement structures:
MElement​=∑i​Ei​+EBinding​
Here, Ei​ represents the energy of each particle (proton/neutron), and EBinding​ is the energy binding them together.
In essence, QIH provides a holographic perspective on the quantum world. The ""boundary"" in QIH isn't just a mathematical construct but represents the universe's informational edge. Every quantum state in our 3D world is mirrored by a state on this 2D boundary, painting a holographic picture of our reality. The dance of particles, from photons to quarks, is both a local and a boundary phenomenon, interconnected by the rich tapestry of entanglement and spacetime geometry.
 Proton as Entangled Light Bits:
    At the heart of QIH is the idea that the fundamental entities in the universe, like protons, are not just ""particles"" but manifestations of quantum information. Within the proton, quarks and gluons interact and are bound together, possibly through some form of entanglement.
∣Proton⟩=∫d3pϕ(p)∣3q,p⟩
    Interference Pattern and the Boundary:
    This brings us to the AdS/CFT correspondence principle, where the dynamics in the bulk (like the interactions within the proton) can be fully described by data on a boundary. Imagine this boundary as a 'holographic screen' which captures the quantum states of entities within the bulk, such as our proton.
∣Quark in Bulk⟩↔ψBoundary​(x)
    Hawking Radiation and Quantum Decoherence:
    Hawking radiation, as theorized, results from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon of black holes. If we extend this to the idea of ER=EPR (where Einstein-Rosen bridges, or wormholes, are equivalent to EPR pairs, or entangled particle pairs), the ""snipping"" of these wormholes could result in a particle taking on a definite state due to decoherence.
    ∣Entangled State⟩→∣Decohered State1​⟩+∣Decohered State2​⟩
    Mirroring and Opposite Universe:
    If the universe is indeed holographic, and every particle's state can be described on a boundary, then this boundary information can theoretically represent a mirror of our universe's properties. The notion of an ""opposite"" universe emerging from the decoherence process, with opposing quantum states, is a more speculative idea but can be entertained within the QIH framework.
