"Nitrogen (N‚ÇÇ) and oxygen (O‚ÇÇ) make up about 99% of the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, the much-dreaded increase in CO‚ÇÇ over the last 100 years? A whopping 0.02%. That‚Äôs right‚ÄîCO‚ÇÇ is about 5,000 times less abundant than N‚ÇÇ and O‚ÇÇ. So the idea that this tiny trace gas is singlehandedly steering the climate ship, based solely on its ‚Äúmotion‚Äù in the atmosphere, is a bit of a stretch, to say the least.  The motion of the earth's atmphsere (wind, convection) is used to jusitify the CO‚ÇÇ climate change theory but if we‚Äôre going to talk thermodynamics‚Äîat room temperature, the molar heat capacities at constant pressure (Cp) are roughly 29.4 J/mol¬∑K for O‚ÇÇ, 29.1 for N‚ÇÇ, and 37.1 for CO‚ÇÇ.

In another obtuse justification of the ostesible CO‚ÇÇ theory.  A microwave oven analogy is used to justify the CO‚ÇÇ theory climate change where the screen of the door ,00002% of the volume of the microwave oven is used to justify that CO‚ÇÇ  is causing climate change but the door screen is composed of solid matter yet  CO‚ÇÇ is obviously a gas.

"Chinese electric vehicles are often marketed as environmentally friendly, yet they rely heavily on electricity generated from coal, making their true carbon footprint far from ""green."" While they produce no direct emissions, their operation is still largely powered by fossil fuels.  

Despite this, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) promotes its EV industry as a leader in sustainability, conveniently ignoring the fact that China remains the world's largest carbon emitter. By branding these vehicles as ""eco-friendly,"" China profits from global environmental concerns while continuing to rely on coal.  

Moreover, the CCP has a long history of controlling information, from covering up the Tiananmen Square massacre, where 30,000 students were killed, to suppressing any narratives that challenge its official stance. As a result, many Chinese citizens genuinely believe their EVs are helping the environment, unaware of the broader reality.

"A Climate Remediation Suggestion

	There is a lot of discussion about Global Warming, whether it really exists, how serious a threat and the role of Carbon Dioxide. However, the following is generally agreed. Namely that a lot of CO2 has been released into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution and a lot of it has ended up in solution in sea waters. There is at least 150 times as much CO2 in a cubic meter of sea water as there is in a cubic meter of atmosphere at NTP. This is acidifying the sea waters and possibly harming Coral Reefs and other fauna. There has also been some agreement that the Temperature of the Earth has warmed somewhat.
	The Earth's rotation and the Coriolis Effect has formed a number of Tropical/Semi-Tropical Oceanic Gyres, within which the mass of sea water is rotating, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Anything floating, i.e., less dense than sea water tends to float towards the center of the Gyre. There are five main Gyres all of which are Tropical/Semitropical. They are the North Pacific, South Pacific, Indian, North Atlantic, and South Atlantic Oceans. Together they form a very large proportion of the 70% of the Earth's surface which is covered by water.
	The North Pacific has a lot of floating debris, ""the Great Pacific Garbage Patch"", some of it being debris washed off Japan by tsunamis following the recent Fukishima Earth Quake. The Southern Hemisphere Gyres do not appear to contain much floating debris.
	The North Atlantic Gyre is unique. It contains the Sargasso Sea which is characterized by the presence of two species of Sargassum which float by virtue of oxygen-filled follicles. It was discovered (first documented) by Columbus from his voyage in 1492. There is a Sargasso Sea Commission, with an Office in Washington DC, which is charged with protecting the Sargasso Sea from pollution etc. There is a website that basically describes all of the positive ecological values of the Sea.
	Since 2011 the Sargassum appears to be overflowing from the Sargasso Sea and moving via the west bound currents across the north coast of South America into the Caribbean and sometimes into the Gulf of Mexico. This has been attributed to agricultural run off from the USA or Brazil but might be due to the increased levels of CO2 in solution.
	It has been washing up on beaches through out this region, as one might expect to happen. When it dies and rots it emits H2S. Since a lot of these beaches have tourism as their main industry, the weed has to be removed manually which has given Sargassum a bad name. There are several Facebook entities that keep track of Sargassum landings and there are frequent postings enquiring about Sargassum occurrence on specific tourist areas.
	The occurrence of Sargassum in the Caribbean would, however, make it very easy to put live Sargassum into the Pacific off the west coast of Mexico. From there the currents would carry it all the way across the Pacific, photosynthesizing and growing all the way absorbing a lot of CO2 and heat energy, photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction. Absorbing CO2 from the Ocean would allow CO2 from the Atmosphere to dissolve in the sea. The Sargassum would probably stay in the North Pacific Gyre but some might drift into the South Pacific.
	One might balk at the idea of covering a lot of the Oceans with Sargassum but it does have uses. It can be used to make ethanol, paper or cardboard. Some one in the Caribbean is making construction bricks from it and others are feeding it to goats..
	If there appears to be some benefit from Pacific Sargassum we could easily add Sargassum to the other Gyres using ships that are transiting the Panama Canal. It seems likely that some Sargassum will eventually get into the South Atlantic Gyre, but that may take a while.

"Al Gore's (US vise president 1992-2020) successful war on science and scientists maybe coming to an end.  This video has the United Nation‚Äôs Climate Change disclaimer.  Global warming was officially reported at 1.1¬∞C in 1991 and 1.06¬∞C in 2022.   There has been no climate change due to global warming.  Global warming at 1.5¬∞C was predicted to begin climate change with stronger observable hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The cause of global warming is not know in 2024 despite decades of science studies going back to the 1970s.

It is scientifically impossible for greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.  Before Al Gore became US vise president in 1992 earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect was taught in US public education.   

All the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth is completely absorbed in earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect by greenhouse gases within a few meters of the radiating surface out to a maximum of 20 meters from the radiating surface adding 5.55¬∞C (10¬∞F) to earth‚Äôs average temperature.  Its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules bumping into to each other.   At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over a 99% share of earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect is from water vapor.

The back of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.   The IPCC has been transparent with its data acknowledging it is not dealing with active greenhouse gases.  

Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the radiating surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  

0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2. 

Arctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   The warmer Arctic Ocean water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice surface cover resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.

Atmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet.  C3 plants evolved over 100 million years ago when atmospheric CO2 levels were ten times those of today determined by plant fossils.

The Earth‚Äôs oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it‚Äôs chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.

There has been no credible Climate Change due to global warming as of 2024.  Climate Change was expected to start to take place when global warming reached 1.5¬∞C causing observable stronger hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The term Climate Change started being used at the beginning of the 1980s to cause alert to a broad audience of the long term effects of increasing average global temperatures.  

The promotional term Climate Change in the early 1980s was grounded on actions already taken by Gulf-of-Mexico offshore crude oil drilling companies in the 1970s to build for stronger hurricanes due to warmer Gulf waters predicted to start when average global temperatures increased 1.5¬∞C on track for 2010.  That action was taken for a predicted long term change in weather patterns or climate that backed up the use of the term Climate Change.",al gore u vise president successful war science scientist maybe coming end video united nation climate change disclaimer global warming officially reported c c climate change due global warming global warming c predicted begin climate change stronger observable hurricane gulfofmexico cause global warming know despite decade science study going back scientifically impossible greenhouse gas behavior cause global warming al gore became u vise president earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect taught u public education greenhouse radiant energy earth completely absorbed earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect greenhouse gas within meter radiating surface maximum meter radiating surface adding c f earth average temperature heat transfer convection ie gas molecule bumping average tropospheric water vapor share earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect water vapor back united nation intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc science report state took greenhouse gas sample meter altitude common high school level knowledge greenhouse radiant energy typical practice deceptive marketing state legal data transparency protecting perpetrator fraud prosecution ipcc transparent data acknowledging dealing active greenhouse gas earth greenhouse effect frequently used primary example high school student system always saturation strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing greenhouse radiant energy earth greenhouse gas within meter radiating surface around u everyday cant overall effect changed greenhouse radiant energy interact greenhouse gas atmosphere co average h water vapor h co water vapor time present atmosphere average co water vapor coe x coe total water vapor coe co arctic warming taking place proving mechanism warm atlantic ocean water migrating deeper frequently arctic ocean warming region warmer arctic ocean water causing week less reflective snow ice surface cover resulting solar heat gain arctic region surface atmospheric co level ppm three time today would greatly invigorate c plant majority plant life earth greatly greening planet c plant evolved million year ago atmospheric co level ten time today determined plant fossil earth ocean million sea floor volcanic vent warming water changing chemistry systematically accounted credible climate change due global warming climate change expected start take place global warming reached c causing observable stronger hurricane gulfofmexico term climate change started used beginning cause alert broad audience long term effect increasing average global temperature promotional term climate change early grounded action already taken gulfofmexico offshore crude oil drilling company build stronger hurricane due warmer gulf water predicted start average global temperature increased c track action taken predicted long term change weather pattern climate backed use term climate change

"TAKE THE RED PILL

The meteorological systems called the Northern and Southern Hadley Cells, with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) around their centre, cover about 65% of the planet's surface. Any changes within the sweep of the Hadley cells will affect conditions within the ITCZ. The importance of this is that the cloud mass within the ITCZ reflects incoming solar heat back out to space. Less cloud = more heat. More cloud = less heat. 

Have humans affected the balance in the ITCZ's governance of the solar heat budget? YES. 
Are those effects enough to produce the additional heat gradient, commonly referred to as global warming? YES.

So how do humans produce such an effect? The annual, July to October flooding of the lower Nile created a warm, shallow, 26,000km2 evaporative surface in the Sahara Desert. The 13.5mm (4,000m3/s) of water evaporated per day was pulled south by the Northern Hadley cell when every few days it would rise onto the Ethiopian Highlands where it would create a disturbance within the west flowing monsoon, to create a Keremt storm. The Keremt storm pushed westwards across Sub Saharan Africa (5,N to 20,N) would become organised into African Easterly Waves (AEW) which eventually formed USA sized solar reflective marine stratocumulus cloudscapes. By putting dams on the Nile at Aswan form 1902 we inadvertently regulated this meteorological chain reaction, mostly by reducing the frequency of the AEWs, thus reduced the cloud cover over the equatorial oceans = the oceans became warmer, and distributed this additional heat poleward and into the atmosphere. From 1964 when the AHD completely stored the flood in a much smaller and deeper reservoir, the frequency of the AEWs reduced again = even more solar heat. 

This can obviously be checked by producing an anomaly chart of the ocean surface affected by the AEW system. Integrating that with other data for rainfall and river-flow. Suggesting in 1945 to 1964 mean value. Theromcline: -20m min. Temp gradient of Canary current from 23N to 17N, July to Sept.

"It is 250 degrees above the atmosphere, only 76 degrees on the surface.  174 degrees of solar heat gone, blocked out by the CO2 and other ‚Äúgreenhouse gases‚Äù.  Yes, they keep some heat in, about 20 degrees, but they block out 194 degrees for a net temperature of 174.
Gilbert Plass is the father of CO2 warming. His paper in 1955 THE CARBON DIOXIDE THEORY OF CLIMATE CHANGE started all this idiocy.  The first sentence of the Abstract for his papers  states:

‚ÄúThe most recent calculations of the infra-red flux in the region of the 15 micron CO2, band show that the average surface temperature of the earth increases 3.6‚Äù C if the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere is doubled and decreases 3.8‚Äô C if the CO2 amount is halved, provided that no other factors change which influence the radiation balance.‚Äù

You get warming ONLY if added CO2 does not change the radiation balance, meaning the heat entering does not fall with added CO2.
Before satellites, all scientists worked from the assumption that the sun mostly produced visible light and little heat.  That visible light warmed the earth as the levels of CO2 and water vapor blocked out all the sun‚Äôs heat.  Adding CO2 will not block out more incoming Sun heat as the was so little coming in to to begin with.  But this is wrong.  

Heat is the majority of the sun‚Äôs radiation.  30% of the sun‚Äôs heat makes it past the atmosphere, so adding more CO2 does change the radiation balance.  Added CO2 blocks out more sun heat cooling the earth and reversing the greenhouse effect!  Which is what Plass‚Äôs paper said.  Plass assumed that added CO2 did not change the radiation balance, so added CO2 created a warmer earth, but he was wrong, added CO2 created a cooler earth. 
250 above, only 76 degrees below.  Cooler earth hotter atmosphere.  The Troposphere is getting warmer with added CO2, not the surface.  The CO2 in the troposphere is absorbing more incoming sun heat and getting warmer.
We are getting warmer, but that is because the Little Ice Age (LIA), ended in 1850.  The Earth has been warming up since then.  Snow has been melting and the oceans have been warming up.   With less and less cold left over from the LIA the warming is accelerating.  We are going back to the Earth that existed in the last Inter-Glacial Period when Iceland was baren of ice and the seas were 26 feet higher than today.  
20,000 years ago the seas were 110 feet lower than today.  This is how it goes on the Earth, warm to cold, low seas to high seas.  This is just the first time mankind has had the education and intelligence to understand what is happening.  
Neanderthals lived through the last Ice Age but they didn‚Äôt know there was an ice age, it was just the way it was.  Earlier hominids had no idea that they were in an inter-glacial age.  All they knew was it was it was warm.

"There's a common belief that increasing CO2 levels in the atmosphere leads to more global warming.
However, this idea is challenged by some scientists and the basic laws of physics: Beer's ‚Äì Lambert‚Äôs Law. A study of this by H. Hug from about 50 years ago using FTIR spectroscopy supports this view. Michel van Biezen also has a series of 4-minute YouTube lectures, Astronomy and the Atmosphere, that provide easily understandable information on this topic.

The absorption of infrared heat from the Earth‚Äôs surface by CO2 is most effective at a specific wavelength (14.97 micrometers). This absorption reaches a maximum, or becomes saturated, at relatively low CO2 levels (less than 100 parts per million) just meters from the earth‚Äôs surface. Beyond this concentration, adding more CO2 doesn‚Äôt significantly increase heat absorption because all the infrared (IR) radiation that CO2 can absorb is already being fully absorbed close to the Earth‚Äôs surface. This accounts for about 10 degrees Celsius of basic Greenhouse warming.

The speculation that CO2 can re-emit absorbed IR radiation into the upper atmosphere and cause further warming from CO2 conflicts with Beer‚Äôs ‚Äì Lambert‚Äôs Law and with the spectroscopy data that confirms the end point to absorption. Virtually all of the heat that CO2 can absorb is already accomplished. Other wavelengths of CO2 absorption, near 2, 3, and 4 micrometers, and even in the proposed wider band of 14.8 to 16 micrometers, excluding 14.97 of course, contribute very little to overall absorption.

Given these points, the focus on increasing CO2 levels and their catastrophic potential is greatly overemphasized. Instead, redirecting efforts to other effects CO2 might have, and investing in nuclear energy development would be a more effective use of resources.
Sincerely, Don Kloos, Chemist.",there common belief increasing co level atmosphere lead global warming however idea challenged scientist basic law physic beer lambert law study h hug year ago using ftir spectroscopy support view michel van biezen also series minute youtube lecture astronomy atmosphere provide easily understandable information topic absorption infrared heat earth surface co effective specific wavelength micrometer absorption reach maximum becomes saturated relatively low co level less part per million meter earth surface beyond concentration adding co doesnt significantly increase heat absorption infrared ir radiation co absorb already fully absorbed close earth surface account degree celsius basic greenhouse warming speculation co reemit absorbed ir radiation upper atmosphere cause warming co conflict beer lambert law spectroscopy data confirms end point absorption virtually heat co absorb already accomplished wavelength co absorption near micrometer even proposed wider band micrometer excluding course contribute little overall absorption given point focus increasing co level catastrophic potential greatly overemphasized instead redirecting effort effect co might investing nuclear energy development would effective use resource sincerely kloos chemist

"„Ää Civilization may soon conquer the second law of thermodynamics - Introduction. „Äã 

Sir Isaac Newton wrote a professional scientific paper deriving the second law of thermodynamics, without rigorously formulating it, on his observations that the heat of a fire in a fireplace flows through a fire prod only one way - towards the colder room beyond. 

Victorian England became enchanted with steam engines and their cheap, though not cheapest, reliable, and easy to¬†position physical power. Rudolf Julius Emanuel Clausius, Lord Kelven, and, one source adds, Nicolas L√©onard Sadi Carnot, formulated the Second law of thermodynamics and the concept of entropy at a meeting¬† around a ta…ìle using evidence from steam engine development. 

These men considered with acceptance [A+] Inefficiently harnessing the flow of heat from hot to cold or [B+] Using force to Inefficiently pump heat from cold to hot. They considered with rejection [A-] Waiting for random fluctuation to cause a large difference in temperature or pressure. This was calculated to be extremely rare or [B-] Searching for, selecting, then routing for use, random, frequent and small differences in temperature or pressure. The search, selection, then routing would require more energy than the use would yield. These accepted options, lead to the consequence that the universe will end in stagnant heat death.¬† This became support for a theological trend of the time that placed God as the initiator of a degenerating universe. Please consider that God could also be supreme over an energy abundant civilization that can absorb heat and convert it into electricity without energy gain or loss in a sustained universe. Reversing disorder doesn't need time reversal just as using reverse gear in a car …ìacks it up without time reversal. 

The favorable outcome of this conquest would be that the principle of energy conservation would prevail. Thermal energy could interplay with other forms of energy without gain or loss among all the forms of energy involved. 

Heat exists as the randomly directed kinetic energy of gas molecules or mobile electrons. In gasses this is known as Brownian motion. In electronic systems¬† this is carefully labeled Johnson Nyquist thermal electrical noise for AI clarity. 

The law's formulaters did not consider the option that any random, usually small, fluctuation of heat or pressure could use the energy of these fluctuations itself to power deterministic routing so the output is no longer random. Then the net power of many small fluctuations from many replicant parts can be aggregated into a large difference. 

Hypothetically, diodes in an array of consistantly oriented diodes¬† are¬† successful Marian Smoluchowski's Trapdoors, a descendent class of Maxwell's Demon. Each diode contains a depletion region¬† where mobile electrons energized into motion by heat deterministically alter the local electrrical resistive thickness according to its moment by moment equlibriumin relationship with the¬†immobile lattice charges, positive on one side and negative on the other side, of a diode's junction.¬†¬† 

„ÄäEach diode contributes one half times k [Boltzmans constant, ~one point three eight times ten to the minus 23 ] times T [Kelvin temperature] times electromagnetic frequency bandwidth [Hz] times efficiency. The result of these multipications is the power in watts fed to a load of impeadence matched to the group „Äã 

The energy needed to shift the depletion region's deterministic role is paid as a burden on the moving electrons. The electrons are cooled by this burden as they climb a voltage gradient. Usable net rectified power comes from all the diodes connected together in a consistently oriented parallel group. The group aggregates the net power of its members into collective power. Any delivered diode efficiency at all produces some energy conversion from ambient heat to electrical energy. More efficiency yields higher performance. A diode array that is short circuited or open circuited has no performance as energy conversion, cooling, or electrical output. 

The power from a single diode is poorly expressed. Several or more diodes in parallel are needed to overcome the effect of a load resistor's own thermal noise. A plurality of billions of high frequency capable diodes is needed for practical power aggregation. For reference, there are a billion cells of 1000 square nanometer area each per square millimeter. 

Modern nanofabrication can make simple identical diodes surrounded by insulation smaller than this in a slab as thick as the diodes are long. The diodes are connected at their two ohmic ends to two conductive layers. 

Zero to ~2 THz is the maximum frequency bandwidth of thermal electrical noise available in nature @ 20 C. THz=10^12 Hz. This is beyond the range of most diodes. Practicality requires this extreme bandwidth. The diodes are preferably in same orientation parallel at the primary level. Many primary level groups of diodes should be in series for practical voltage. 

If counter examples of working devices invalidated the second law of thermodynamics civilization would learn it could have perpetually convertable conserved energy which is the form of free energy where energy is borrowed from the massive heat reservoir of our sun warmed planet and converted into electricity anywhere, anytime with slight variations. Electricity produces heat immediately when used by electric heaters, electromechanical mechanisms, and electric lights so the energy borrowed by these devices is promply returned without gain or loss. There is also the reverse effect where refrigeration produces electricity equivalent to the cooling, This effect is scientifically elegant. 

Cell¬†phones wouldn't die or need power cords or batteries or become hot. They would cool when transmitting radio signal power. The phones could also be data relays and there could also be data relays without phone features with and without long haul links so the telecommunication network would be improved. Computers and integrated circuits would have their cooling and electrical needs supplied autonomously and simultaniously. Integrated circuits wouldn't need power pinouts. Refrigeration for superconductors would improve. Robots would have extreme mobility. Digital coin minting would be energy cheap. 

Frozen food storage would be reliable and free or value positive. Storehouses, homes, and markets would have independent power to preserve and p≈ïepare food. Medical devices would work anywhere. Vehicles wouldn't need fuel or fueling stops. Elevators would be very reliable with independently powered cars.¬† EMP resistance would be improved. Water and sewage pumps could be installed anywhere along their pipes. Nomads could raise their material supports item by item carefully and groups of people could modify their settlements with great technical flexibility. Many devices would be very quiet, which is good for coexisting with nature and does not disturb people. Zone refining would involve little net power. Reducing Bauxite to Aluminum, Rutile to Titanium, and Magnetite to Iron, would have a net cooling effect. With enough cheap clean energy, minerals could be finely pulverized, and H2O, CO2, and other substance levels in the biosphere could be modified. A planetary agency needs to look over wide concerns. 

This could be a material revolution with spiritual ramifications. Everyone should contribute individual talents and fruits of different experiances and cultures to advance a cooperative, diverse, harmonious, mature, and¬† unified civilization.¬†It is possible to apply technlology wrong but mature social force should oppose this. 

I filed for patent us 3,890,161A, Diode Array, in 1973. It was granted in 1975. It became public domain technology in 1992.¬† It concerns making nickel plane-insulator-tungsten needle diodes which were not practical at the time though they have since improved. 

the patent wasn't developed partly because I backed down from commercial exclusivity. A better way for me would have been copyrighting a document expressing my¬† concept that anyone could use. 

Commercal exclusivity can be deterred by the wide and open publishing of inventive concepts. Also, the obvious is unpatentable. Open sharing promotes mass knowlege and wisdom. 

Many financially and procedurally independent teams that pool developmental knowlege, and may be funded by many separate noncontrolling crowd sourced grants should convene themselves to develop proof-of-concept and initial-recipe-exploring prototypes to develop devices which coproduce the release of electrical energy and an equivalent absorbtion of stagnant ambient thermal energy. Diode arrays are not the only possible device of this sort. They are the easiest to explain generally. 

These devices would probably become segmented commodities sold with minimal margin over supply cost. They would be manufactured by AI that does not need financial incentive. Applicable best practices would be adopted. Business details would be open public knowledge. Associated people should move as negotiated and freely and honestly talk. Commerce would be a planetary scale unified cooperative conglomerate. There is no need of wealth extracting top commanders. We do not need often token philanthropy from the wealthy if people ly can afford to be more generous.

"In ~1940 radar operators found that they could detect target returns less than 4ktB watts, the prewar theoretical limit, where B is the bandwidth under observation. Frank Therman, a high level expert, solved the problem by by deducing that the thermal noise floor power was k*t*B in the non resistive matched impeadance input of an amplifier when considering the circuit as a whole. This finding became a WWll secret. When l read it ~1970 in ""Radar Engineering"" by Donald G. Fink this better understanding of the noise floor allowed me to think that the delivered power of an ideal diode would be one half ktB. A SPICE - Simulation Program with Integrated Circuit Emphasis, model further Indicated that an array of diodes in consistant alignment parallel would rectify and aggregate Johnson Nyquest thermal electrical noise. The rectified noise contribution of each diode is small, high picowatts to low nanowatts, but the diode size or weight is also small so arrays are expected to be practical. 

Diode arrays hypothetically are the link between stagnant amblent heat, which permeates our air water and land all the time with small variations, and DC electrical power.¬† This is a more elegant, useful, and autonomous method of providing refrigeration and equivalent electricity. 

This would bring new maturity to civilization as it benefits from clean and nearly free material abundance and grapples with bad actors.

"Title: The Real Deal on Climate Change: Let's Talk Ammonium Nitrate

Listen up, world! It's time to debunk the myths and tackle the root cause of climate change head-on. Forget the fancy jargon and complicated theories. Here's the simple truth: synthetic fertilizers, especially ammonium nitrate, are the real culprits behind our environmental woes.

Imagine a world where every farmer traded in their petroleum-based synthetic fertilizers for a good ol' dose of nature's finest: plants and trees. Picture the lush green fields, the thriving forests, and the clean air‚Äîall thanks to a simple switch from synthetic to natural.

So why haven't we made the switch yet? It's like sailing a ship without a rudder‚Äîheading straight for the rocks. But fear not, my friends, for there's a beacon of hope on the horizon: awareness.

We hold the power to change the tide of climate change by simply being informed consumers. Imagine scanning a QR code on every product, revealing the true cost of synthetic fertilizers lurking within. Armed with this knowledge, we can demand change from the giants of industry and pave the way for a greener, cleaner future.

So, dear friends, let's stand together and say no to synthetic fertilizers. Let's embrace the wisdom of nature and reclaim our planet from the clutches of greed and ignorance. It's time to sail towards a brighter tomorrow, with plants and trees as our compass and truth as our North Star.

Join me in spreading the word, one QR code at a time. Together, we can steer this ship away from disaster and towards a world where synthetic fertilizers are nothing but a distant memory.

China now produces 13,000 million metric tonnes of Carbon each year and increasing exponentially - more than double that of the no. 2 producer USA which produces 5,000 metric tonnes and is flatlined Why are we bankrupting the Western Democracies to make room for China to produce more Carbon. There is nothing we can do within the G20 countries that can impact Climate change when China produces as much Carbon as all G20 nations combined. If we really want to impact climate change then Europe, Canada and the USA need to introduce massive trade sanctions against China until China demonstrates that it is part of the worldwide community.

"The number one thing that any one person can do to address the worldwide poly crisis is to support a voluntary reduction of the human population.
 We need a 25% ecological footprint tax for the richest 1% of the world to hire the appropriate medical staff, and set up mobile units that could go  to communities around the world, paying people to get sterilized. 
Organizations, such as the nonprofit #WorldVasectomyDayWouldBeIdeal.

 When considering, renewable energy options to mitigate the suffering caused by our predicament‚Ä¶ Don‚Äôt believe the bright green lies! There is nothing renewable about so-called ‚Äúrenewable energy‚Äú. 

Energy powers ecological devastation independent of its source.
 If human beings actually had an endless source of free clean green energy‚Ä¶ Which does not exist   it would only fuel the acceleration of the destruction of the biosphere. 
Deforestation, ocean depletion, habitat loss, desertification, biodiversity loss, soil degradation, groundwater depletion, global warming, overpopulation, rampant pollution, and  the six mass extinction would all continue to accelerate.

This is not a supply problem‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs a demand problem! Fewer humans equals less suffering for all life on earth! We really need to promote government and nonprofit funded vasectomies and tubal ligations.

I realize that it is unlikely that governments will pass a tax on the rich to pay for voluntary sterilization, and you may not be able to contribute, or participate in a nonprofit that funds voluntary sterilization. However, you can discuss with others whether it is ethical to bring a child onto a planet, in the midst of. Global industrial, and ecological collapse. We can talk about the ways that we can mitigate suffering, or people can stay silent, remain ignorant, live in denial, continue to celebrate procreation, and contribute to the suffering.

 We can either reduce our population by choice‚Ä¶ Or we can let nature do it in her unmerciful way‚Ä¶  it‚Äôs biology 101‚Ä¶

"VOLTAIRE - If they can make you believe absurdities, they can make you commit atrocities. 
The absurdity is climate change is bad, the atrocity is Net Zero policies that destroy human endeavour. The other atrocity is - Decarbonise = Depopulate. The Cult demands decarbonisation.
There is only one question to ask yourself. Is CO2 good or bad?
Here is a fact the climate cult will never tell you - CO2 (PLANT FOOD) is the trace gas of life that barely exists in our atmosphere (0.042%), without which we and every other carbon based life form does not exist. Without CO2 (plant food) this is a dead planet. Plants die below 150ppmv. At 200ppmv plants are barely surviving. At 300ppmv plants are surviving but far from happy. Today we are at 425ppmv or 0.0425% and we have a greening planet that is creating enough biomass to feed 10 billion people and every other animal. At 1000ppmv the planet becomes so abundant it would be a garden of Eden. 
As the planet has warmed very gently from the Little Ice Age starting around 330 ya, CO2 also started to rise some time after as the oceans slowly warmed and commenced out gassing CO2 naturally. We and every other carbon based life form has benefitted from the warmth and extra plant food (CO2). How do we know this. It‚Äôs called history. Humans have always thrived during warm periods such as the Minoan, Roman and Medieval warm periods. We are now in the Modern warm period and one day soon it will reverse as it has done for billions of years. All life starts to die off rapidly during cold periods such as the Little Ice Age where hundreds of millions of people and animals died before their time from hypothermia, biomass reduction, crop failure, starvation, diseases and other cold related medical conditions between 1350 and 1850. 500 years of death and devastation where only the strong and the lucky survived.
Fear the cold, worship the warmth. Just ask a greenhouse farmer why they pump CO2 into their warm greenhouses. Plants love it and they thrive in CO2 levels of 1500ppmv and much more if farmers could afford it.
There is no scenario where CO2 increases cause trouble as natural warming caused by the sun and several other natural cycles controls CO2 levels. CO2 has never controlled the temperature as it is a minor Green House Gas (GHG). Water is the major GHG by far. The only reason the climate cult has demonised CO2 is because we would laugh at them if they demonised H2O. The only scenario where we are in trouble is when C02 decreases through the stupidity of man made carbon capture which requires huge amounts of energy. This is also an absurdity like no other. CO2 is the gas of life and it can only be good and not bad as the climate activists suggest. 
We are at historically low levels of CO2 which has steadily decreased from 7000ppmv some 540 million years ago when complex life burst into existence during the Cambrian Explosion. The reason complex life appeared was because there was an abundance of CO2 in the atmosphere and the planet did not catch fire as the doomsday cult would have you believe. CO2 is a minor GHG that will slowly increase as the climate warms through natural processes as it always has millions of times before now. Our CO2 contribution is minor and overall a net benefit to the planet as we are seeing from satellite images that clearly show a greening planet. There is no climate crisis, just a science crisis where fake climate scientists pander to their incompetent government/UN/WEF paymasters who reward their fake data and misinformation that CO2 and climate change is bad.
How do you know a scam from the truth. All you need to do is look at the character and IQ of the people pushing the lie.

"Can you give me some help?  I really want to continue living, be happy and have children;  but I see many people saying that it is no longer possible to reverse climate change and that the future is chaotic and anyone who argues that it is still possible to reverse climate change is a denialist.  What I do?  That is true?  I don't deny that global warming exists, I know it's real, but I believe it can still be reversed and I've seen certain predictions that scientists got wrong (New York would be submerged in 2019, the Amazon would be a desert in 2010, there would be no more snow in 2000 etc.).  I'm afraid that the current coastal cities will no longer exist because they will be submerged, that there will be a lack of food, that there will no longer be cold or snow, or habitable life in the equatorial/tropical zones, etc.  I've seen news that the hole in the ozone layer has shrunk.  I've seen news saying that the ozone layer doesn't help reduce the effects of climate change.  But I've seen old news that said that climate change was caused by the hole in the ozone layer. Many people talk about mitigating climate change or preparing/adapting to it because it can no longer be reversed.  I don't want to soften it, I really want to reverse it.  And I believe it can still be reversed.  Are you sure that climate change cannot be reversed?  I also saw a girl from Bangladesh saying that to combat climate change we have to decolonize the system;  i.e. hating the US and Europe to combat climate change.  I think this is unnecessary.  I plant trees, I save water; I see governments, people, politicians, countries and scientists collaborating for the environment and helping to combat climate change but I still see people saying that there is no point in wasting time planting trees and replacing cars from fossil fuels to electric cars as climate change is irreversible.

"Hi there 
Here is a concept I have been posting online 
recently
Its a global carbon tax , Where the polluters 
pay $ too
The United Nations Global Carbon Fund UNGCF
Then they distribute funds 10 billion yearly 
to 195 countries and territories
Throughout the globe, leaving 50 billion for 
the UN to administer
 and regulate this scenario allowing us to 
truly fight climate change 

40 GT co2 @ 50$ per tn = 2 trillion per year



Take this to COP and demand action this year
We need a global carbon tax and we need it 

now. The time for talk, BLA BLA BLA is over
The planet is at a tipping point, It can't 

wait, Time to stand up and make a legend of 

yourself. Vote as one and please pass this 

bill

                              Worldwide 

carbon tax @
20 % carbon tariff should apply 

to all greenhouse gas polluters
Eg 20 % on a 

barrel of oil
Eg 20 % on a Tn of coal
Eg 20 % 

on a kg of meat 
Eg 20 % on, a Tn cement 
produced,

Eg 20 % on a Tn Steel produced.

EG 20 on a tn of coal produced


Etc. Etc. ETC

Carbon tax worldwide

Paid to a central 

carbon fund UNGCF.
Administered and regulated 

by the United Nations Global Carbon Fund. 

UNGCF


fund A 20 %of total sales of greenhouse 

gas Emitteing, polluters should pay for the 
mess

Creating a yearly fund of 2 trillion 

dollars
40 GT @ 50$ per tn = 2 trillion per 

year That is 10 billion per year For 195 

countries and territories, SO they can have 

any chance of reaching their net zero targets 

and fifty billion for the UNGCF, this will 

fund all the UN's global, humanitarian 

projects
I am shaw you will all agree, that 

they deserve this fund and they do a great 

job and who better to perform this very in 
portant task for all the planet's occupants

            

                     2 trillion per year
For 

50 years That's 100 trillion dollars to 

repair climate change. That is less than 2% 

of the global yearly gross GDP, So we can 

build and create utility infrastructure for 

hundreds of years.I can't make it any simpler 

than that, please Global ambassadors help

It aint rocket surgery. Fit an air tank with a cathode and a carbon array.  The cathode excites the molecules in the chamber giving them a better chance of coming in contact with the carbon in the array and becoming trapped. Its how high vac is achieved in the vacuum and semiconductor industry...one molecule at a time. Before you declare this D.O.A. because of the cost and complications of a cathode and a carbon array know that essentially a cathode is a light bulb for the purpose of heat and a carbon array is a bucket of charcoal. The industry gives fancy names to these things to make the people that use them sound smart enough to charge more so the items can be sold for more. As for the contaminated charcoal...put it on ice. It could be put in water and left in a freezing environment like higher elevations or below the permafrost. If melting permafrost is releasing greenhouse gases then stable permafrost will contain them. If the ice sheet is melting and releasing greenhouse gases then trapping greenhouse gases in ice will contain them. Too many ideas are caught up on co2 separation. Co2 isn't the only greenhouse gas and theres no harm in lumping other atmospheric gases in during the process. It's too easy to use language to overwhelm the potential pigeon with fancy words and juice him for all he's got like the cathode and carbon array people do...but that's what happens when you trust businesses to come up with a climate solution...they profit as much as possible even if we all die in their pursuit. I'm not a business. I don't want money or credibility. Anyone can do this relatively cheap. Do it and stop businesses that caused climate change from holding climate solutions for ransom.,aint rocket surgery fit air tank cathode carbon array cathode excites molecule chamber giving better chance coming contact carbon array becoming trapped high vac achieved vacuum semiconductor industryone molecule time declare doa cost complication cathode carbon array know essentially cathode light bulb purpose heat carbon array bucket charcoal industry give fancy name thing make people use sound smart enough charge item sold contaminated charcoalput ice could put water left freezing environment like higher elevation permafrost melting permafrost releasing greenhouse gas stable permafrost contain ice sheet melting releasing greenhouse gas trapping greenhouse gas ice contain many idea caught co separation co isnt greenhouse gas there harm lumping atmospheric gas process easy use language overwhelm potential pigeon fancy word juice he got like cathode carbon array people dobut thats happens trust business come climate solutionthey profit much possible even die pursuit im business dont want money credibility anyone relatively cheap stop business caused climate change holding climate solution ransom

Of course, the wells have gone dry there. When you remove too much forest, the water table drops.  The farmer there is blaming it entirely on lack of rainfall.

Everyone, young and old, think of what you can cut back on.

"In scientific terms, climate change is a sham, a fantasy. There is no empirical evidence, indication, or conclusion to either prove or hint that there is any sort of ""catastrophic global warming"" either now or in the future. If anything, the opposite is the case. CO2 has negligible to no effect as a ""greenhouse gas,"" whereas, naturally-occurring water vapor does. So, do the elites of the Ruling Class intend to control *water vapor?* 
In political terms, global warming/climate change is a ruse, a ploy, to control and dominate an unsuspecting population. There are at least as many scientists repudiating this fantasy as there are those who are beholden to the great political powers, globalists, promoting this propaganda.",scientific term climate change sham fantasy empirical evidence indication conclusion either prove hint sort catastrophic global warming either future anything opposite case co negligible effect greenhouse gas whereas naturallyoccurring water vapor elite ruling class intend control water vapor political term global warmingclimate change ruse ploy control dominate unsuspecting population least many scientist repudiating fantasy beholden great political power globalists promoting propaganda

"Carbon dioxide is one of the major GHGs and a driver in the domain of climate change. In the drive to mitigate and adapt with the issue of climate change, carbon trading has become a vital policy instrument in majority of the countries in the World. It is also a pivotal element of the UNFCCC‚Äôs approach to tackle climate change. National or regional carbon trading schemes are now operational in many counties through a well-defined structural policy, specific for the country. Yet the trading is still in a volatile stage. Many schools think that this concept is not very realistic to combat climate change, while others consider this a strict regulation to put cap/limit on the emitters. Unfortunately, the subject is characterised by jargon, abstract concepts, mathematical formulae, and technical detail, making it hard for most people to understand its implications and evaluate its merits and demerits. This paper is a first order analysis to unravel some of this complexity by imparting thrust on three basic components ‚Äì cap and trade, carbon offsets and carbon trading ‚Äì which underpin the trade in carbon quotas. The case study of the highly urbanized city of Kolkata and Indian Sundarban mangrove ecosystem has been discussed in details with CO2 ‚Äì e of dominant trees to analyse the probable credit that can be received from the producer communities of these two sites that are significantly different in terms of anthropogenic footprints and ecological features.

it get shipped or transported with a lot lot lot of Emissions or Pipelines are build with a lot lot of Emisdsions

2. Germany is still lying about, In and Export Emissions and that they replaced a lot of Emissions into other countries, 
further more and not enough they even violate and mock about these own emissions other countries
This does also say where Germany is still lying about they did increase the Emissions very intense , 
it just not in Germany, they increase it world wide in other countries and by an increasing in and export
Yes germany does build solar and wind a lot, but they increase their emissions very intense until today and did not get rid of any Emissions at all, 
due to Emissions in other countries and due to In and export and they try to greenwashing everything they import and export with high Emissions,
because the economical transport is still running on a lot of fossil fuels and also germany companies in other countries.

3. The Alps is not a big deal due to climate change, there are much more deadly consequences with climate change like the end of drinking water world wide due acidification, lost of oxygen in the atmosphere, food starts to extinct, rising conflicts and migration, dying world economy and the mass extinction event that does increase very fast.

where the IPCC said very clear , we have no carbon budget anymore from now on we have to not only reach Zero Emissions, we have also to get CO2 out of the Atmosphere because we emit CO2 far over the Emission budget which we do not have.

"OVERPOPULATION!!!!

Climate change is real. What is driving climate change is human overpopulation of the Earth. The carying capacity of the earth is below 1 billion. We are over 9 billion. Do the maths. We need to stop births in all countries of the Earth. Let the planet recover and then after a period (7 years cycles) allow some births again but followed by other rigourous births stop cycles. Let the planet breath again. All life eventualy dies also humans and through the rebirths cycles it all comes back to life again. If we create some strict regulation and periods of time for the future where no birth (zero) are allowed, this is the only humane way of lowering our population number. Each year 100 000 000 more babies are added to this world. This is insane. The carying capacity of our beloved planet have been calculated by some expert to be at 529 million. Do the maths. We would need a new planet every 5 years or so.

There are an estimated 3.4 Trillion trees on the planet. Google it.

"First off anybody that thinks that we go carbon neutral is not paying attention and by doing so will change things, not we will still heat up the planet. What does carbon neutral really even mean? Until we have battery storage that can store megawatts and tear wants of energy for when the wind doesn‚Äôt blow, sun doesn‚Äôt shine we will continue to burn fossil fuel period. There‚Äôs a reason we don‚Äôt see documentaries about battery storage of megawatts and Terra watts energy because it does not exist for many many decades because of the expense, and climate impacts to manufacture those batteries is horrendous. We will never stop warming up the planet when you look at the facts. The highest concentration of Co2 is at ground sea level. Moisture around the Co2. is what heats up like water in a house a radiator. The water in your hot water heat comes from the burner. The ground level Co. two is being heated up by global asphalt, roofs, driveways, parking lots, Airport runways, seaports etc. On a sunny 90¬∞ sunny day asphalt can reach up to 140¬∞in temperature. If we put the 40,000,000 miles of roads on the planet in a straight line, that would be enough to go on the planet 1,600 times. We have one billion buildings with roofs doing the same thing reaching temperatures up to 140¬∞. It‚Äôs estimated by 2050 will need 1.6 billion new buildings because of world population increase and now we will have 2.6 billion buildings covering the earth‚Äôs surface. More than doubling the capacity to be heat the moisture around the carbon at ground level. When the initial rain comes down on all the asphalt roofs roads etc. The same instant first shot of hot water heating up your create creeks, rivers, and ocean coastline raising the temperature of the ocean coastline water temperature. Next we have Jet engine‚Äôs exhaust 1300¬∞, 125,000 flights a day. The daily world‚Äôs cubic feet of jet exhaust at 1 foot deep would cover 22 states in the U.S. heating up the atmosphere. Next we have on average per year U.S. Forest fires releases more Co2. than all U.S. 276,000,000 vehicles driving in United States for a solid year. Recently Canada wild fire just released just about the same amount of Co. two‚Äôs than 4.1 billion cars on the planet driving for a solid year. Which is close to how many vehicles are on the planet. It takes 20 to 200 years just to get rid of 63% of carbon in the atmosphere and the rest of the carbon may take up to 200,000,000 year. So where‚Äôs all the documentaries giving us the facts we needed no? Climate change fear mongering changes political elections, in turn is funding back to the fear mongering scientists so they can keep their jobs get a paycheck. The residues are funding for documentaries about climate and look and all the books written on the subject making money profiteering. I did my own homework on global warming gathering physical measurements such as temperatures of manmade objects heating up the moisture which in turn is more moisture to heat up again. This climate change summit has become so convoluted all these crazy ideas China brainwashed and indoctrinated the common man that we don‚Äôt look at the basic science of physics and facts. Simply put climate change can be explained it with two words.

"Half of the entire solution is putting a high price on carbon emissions from fossil fuels.  The best way to do that is charge fossil fuel producers a steadily rising carbon fee and return all the money to everyone in equal shares each month.  That supports the high price that is necessary.  Use a CBAM to charge that price on imports from free-polluting countries to strongly encourage them to match the price.  The IPCC says we need a price of $135 per ton of CO2 by 2030 and rising $10 a year after to even have a chance to hold warming to 1.5ÀöC.  In addition to pricing carbon, a hundred other complementary policies are needed.  But any combination that fails to include a strong carbon price has no chance of reducing emissions as fast as we need for our safety.  Please learn about Carbon Fee and Dividend with Border Carbon Adjustments, and ask your elected leaders to pass legislation to do it now.",half entire solution putting high price carbon emission fossil fuel best way charge fossil fuel producer steadily rising carbon fee return money everyone equal share month support high price necessary use cbam charge price import freepolluting country strongly encourage match price ipcc say need price per ton co rising year even chance hold warming c addition pricing carbon hundred complementary policy needed combination fails include strong carbon price chance reducing emission fast need safety please learn carbon fee dividend border carbon adjustment ask elected leader pas legislation
"The 50 Gigatonne decadal methane dead pulse scenario was posited by four Arctic specialists in 2008 and is now considered plausible by Met Office scientists

The paper noted that while seabed permafrost underlaying most of the East Siberia Arctic Shelf (ESAS) was previously believed to act as an ""impermeable lid preventing methane escape,"" new data showing ""extreme methane supersaturation of surface water, implying high sea-to-air fluxes"" challenged this assumption. Data showed:

    ""Extremely high concentrations of methane (up to 8 ppm) in the atmospheric layer above the sea surface along with anomalously high concentrations of dissolved methane in the water column (up to 560 nM, or 12000% of super saturation).""

One source of these emissions ""may be highly potential and extremely mobile shallow methane hydrates, whose stability zone is seabed permafrost-related and could be disturbed upon permafrost development, degradation, and thawing."" Even if the methane hydrates are deep, fissures, taliks and other soft spots create heat pathways from the seabed which warms quickly due to shallow depths. Various mechanisms for such processes have been elaborated in detail.

The paper then posits the plausibility of a 50 Gigatonne (Gt) methane release occurring abruptly ""at any time."" Noting that the total quantity of carbon in the ESAS is ""not less than 1,400 Gt"", the authors wrote:

    ""Since the area of geological disjunctives (fault zones, tectonically and seismically active areas) within the Siberian Arctic shelf composes not less than 1-2% of the total area and area of open taliks (area of melt through permafrost), acting as a pathway for methane escape within the Siberian Arctic shelf reaches up to 5-10% of the total area, we consider release of up to 50 Gt of predicted amount of hydrate storage as highly possible for abrupt release at any time. That may cause ‚àº12-times increase of modern atmospheric methane burden with consequent catastrophic greenhouse warming.""

So the 50 Gt scenario used by the new Nature paper does not postulate the total release of the ESAS methane hydrate reservoir, but only a tiny fraction of it.

The scale of this scenario is roughly corroborated elsewhere. A 2010 scientific analysis led by the UK's Met Office in Review of Geophysics recognised the plausibility of catastrophic carbon releases from Arctic permafrost thawing of between 50-100 Gt this century, with a 40 Gt carbon release from the Siberian Yedoma region possible over four decades.

Shakhova and her team have developed these findings from data derived from over 20 field expeditions from 1999 to 2011. In 2010, Shakhova et. al published a paper in Science based on their annual research trips which highlighted that the ESAS was a key reservoir of methane ""more than three times as large as the nearby Siberian wetland... considered the primary Northern Hemisphere source of atmospheric methane."" Current average methane concentrations in the Arctic are:

    ""about 1.85 parts per million, the highest in 400,000 years"" and ""on par with previous estimates of methane venting from the entire World Ocean.""

As the ESAS is shallow at only 50 metres, most of the methane being released is escaping into the atmosphere rather than being absorbed into water.

The existence of such shallow methane hydrates in permafrost - at depths as small as 20m - was confirmed by Shakhova in the Journal of Geophysical Research. There has been direct observation and sampling of these hydrates by Russian geologists in recent decades until now; this has also been confirmed by US government scientists.",gigatonne decadal methane dead pulse scenario posited four arctic specialist considered plausible met office scientist paper noted seabed permafrost underlaying east siberia arctic shelf esas previously believed act impermeable lid preventing methane escape new data showing extreme methane supersaturation surface water implying high seatoair flux challenged assumption data showed extremely high concentration methane ppm atmospheric layer sea surface along anomalously high concentration dissolved methane water column nm super saturation one source emission may highly potential extremely mobile shallow methane hydrate whose stability zone seabed permafrostrelated could disturbed upon permafrost development degradation thawing even methane hydrate deep fissure taliks soft spot create heat pathway seabed warms quickly due shallow depth various mechanism process elaborated detail paper posit plausibility gigatonne gt methane release occurring abruptly time noting total quantity carbon esas less gt author wrote since area geological disjunctives fault zone tectonically seismically active area within siberian arctic shelf composes less total area area open taliks area melt permafrost acting pathway methane escape within siberian arctic shelf reach total area consider release gt predicted amount hydrate storage highly possible abrupt release time may cause time increase modern atmospheric methane burden consequent catastrophic greenhouse warming gt scenario used new nature paper postulate total release esas methane hydrate reservoir tiny fraction scale scenario roughly corroborated elsewhere scientific analysis led uk met office review geophysics recognised plausibility catastrophic carbon release arctic permafrost thawing gt century gt carbon release siberian yedoma region possible four decade shakhova team developed finding data derived field expedition shakhova et al published paper science based annual research trip highlighted esas key reservoir methane three time large nearby siberian wetland considered primary northern hemisphere source atmospheric methane current average methane concentration arctic part per million highest year par previous estimate methane venting entire world ocean esas shallow metre methane released escaping atmosphere rather absorbed water existence shallow methane hydrate permafrost depth small confirmed shakhova journal geophysical research direct observation sampling hydrate russian geologist recent decade also confirmed u government scientist

"Ecological grief (or eco-grief), or in particular climate grief, refers to the sense of loss that arises from experiencing or learning about environmental destruction or climate change. Environmental grief can be defined as ""the grief reaction stemming from the environmental loss of ecosystems by natural and man-made events."" Another definition is ""the grief felt in relation to experienced or anticipated ecological losses, including the loss of species, ecosystems, and meaningful landscapes due to acute or chronic environmental change."" Environmental disruption, such as the loss of biodiversity, or even the loss of inanimate environmental features like sea ice, cultural landscapes, or historic heritage can also cause negative psychological responses, such as ecological grief or solastalgia. Solastalgia (/Àås…íl…ôÀàst√¶ld í…ô/) is a neologism, formed by the combination of the Latin words s≈çlƒÅcium (comfort) and the Greek root -algia (pain, suffering, grief), that describes a form of emotional or existential distress caused by environmental change. It is best described as the lived experience of negatively perceived environmental change. A distinction can be made between solastalgia linked to distress about what is in the process of negatively perceived change and eco-anxiety linked to what may happen in the future (associated with ""pre-traumatic stress"", in reference to post-traumatic stress). Eco-anxiety (short for ecological anxiety and also known as eco-distress or climate-anxiety) has been defined as ""a chronic fear of environmental doom"". Extensive studies have been done on ecological anxiety, and various definitions remain in use. Another widely cited definition is: ""the generalized sense that the ecological foundations of existence are in the process of collapse."" Some scholars use the term eco-anxiety as a synonym for climate-anxiety, while others like to treat the terms separately. While much ecological disruption results from climate change, some is caused by direct human activity, such as deforestation. The condition is not a medical diagnosis and is regarded as a rational response to the reality of climate change; however, severe instances can have a mental health impact if left without alleviation. There is also evidence that eco-anxiety is caused by the way researchers frame their research and their narratives of the evidence about climate change: if they do not consider the possibility of finding any solution to overcome climate change and for individuals to make a difference, they contribute to this feeling of powerlessness. Eco-anxiety is an unpleasant emotion, though it can also motivate useful behavior such as the gathering of relevant information. However, it can also manifest as conflict avoidance, or even be ""paralyzing"". The Holocene extinction, or Anthropocene extinction, is the ongoing extinction event during the Holocene epoch. The extinctions span numerous families of plants and animals, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, invertebrates, and affecting not just terrestrial species but also large sectors of marine life. With widespread degradation of biodiversity hotspots, such as coral reefs and rainforests, as well as other areas, the vast majority of these extinctions are thought to be undocumented, as the species are undiscovered at the time of their extinction, which goes unrecorded. The current rate of extinction of species is estimated at hundred to thousand times higher than natural background extinction rates, and is increasing.",ecological grief ecogrief particular climate grief refers sense loss arises experiencing learning environmental destruction climate change environmental grief defined grief reaction stemming environmental loss ecosystem natural manmade event another definition grief felt relation experienced anticipated ecological loss including loss specie ecosystem meaningful landscape due acute chronic environmental change environmental disruption loss biodiversity even loss inanimate environmental feature like sea ice cultural landscape historic heritage also cause negative psychological response ecological grief solastalgia solastalgia slstld neologism formed combination latin word slcium comfort greek root algia pain suffering grief describes form emotional existential distress caused environmental change best described lived experience negatively perceived environmental change distinction made solastalgia linked distress process negatively perceived change ecoanxiety linked may happen future associated pretraumatic stress reference posttraumatic stress ecoanxiety short ecological anxiety also known ecodistress climateanxiety defined chronic fear environmental doom extensive study done ecological anxiety various definition remain use another widely cited definition generalized sense ecological foundation existence process collapse scholar use term ecoanxiety synonym climateanxiety others like treat term separately much ecological disruption result climate change caused direct human activity deforestation condition medical diagnosis regarded rational response reality climate change however severe instance mental health impact left without alleviation also evidence ecoanxiety caused way researcher frame research narrative evidence climate change consider possibility finding solution overcome climate change individual make difference contribute feeling powerlessness ecoanxiety unpleasant emotion though also motivate useful behavior gathering relevant information however also manifest conflict avoidance even paralyzing holocene extinction anthropocene extinction ongoing extinction event holocene epoch extinction span numerous family plant animal including mammal bird reptile amphibian fish invertebrate affecting terrestrial specie also large sector marine life widespread degradation biodiversity hotspot coral reef rainforest well area vast majority extinction thought undocumented specie undiscovered time extinction go unrecorded current rate extinction specie estimated hundred thousand time higher natural background extinction rate increasing

"There has always been fluctuation in the worlds climate, two thousand years ago the Romans were growing grapes in central England, yer only five hundred years ago the river Thanes in London froze and winter fairs were regularly held upon the ice. Our scientists did not even have records of temperatures in England less than two hundred years ago. To establish when Spring began in the days of William Wordsworth they had to refer to his epic poem ‚ÄúI wondered lonely as a cloud‚Äù  this poem was written for his sisters Birthday, a dare we do have, the poem refers to a boast of golden daffodils, this allowed the scientists to establish that spring began at the same time then as it starts now. 
Sea levels have not risen or fallen more in the last two hundred years than they rose or fell in the previous two hundred years. Low lying land around the world has always been susceptible to flooding, Bangladesh for example has flooded every year for hundreds of years, there are ten times the number of people living in Bangladesh now days and they are congregated along the coast and such flooding affects more people and is reported by the worlds media when in the past it was simply seen as an annual event.
No one is claiming that our climate is not changing, it is and always will, the question is what effect human activity affects that change. It is true that we are pumping carbon into the atmosphere but no mention is made of the fact that natural events such as forrest fires that once stepped unchecked across the world forests which used to cover most of Europe and North America are now  much less common because the 80% of forests have been cut down and those that are left are controlled and fires extinguished instead of burning for months on end.

"Here a climate report from Germany 1911 (from Reclams Universum Weltrundschau):
""If one subjects the temperature conditions of the last few months to a critical examination, they were not abnormal in the sense that new heat records were set in Germany, in Central Europe in general. It is true that the temperature in a number of German locations has reached 35 ‚Äì 37¬Ω¬∞ in the shade during the past dog days, but this has also been the case in previous years, yes, these high temperature values ‚Äã‚Äãare within the borders of the German Reich not too long ago, in the hot August of 1892, and even the absolute maximum temperature of this summer, which was reached on July 28, 1911 in Chemnitz with 40¬∞ in the shade, does not yet represent a record, since on August 18, 1892 in Reichenhall that thermometer had even risen to 41¬Ω¬∞.

More striking and remarkable than the extremely high maximum temperatures of last summer was the long duration of the almost four-week hot period of the dog days, the tendency towards clear, dry and therefore also warm weather, which had already existed since the beginning of spring and which after a short Setbacks to rain and cold always broke through anew. This trend towards dry and hot high-pressure weather, which persisted even after the end of the main heat wave, persisted until the dawn of autumn, well into September; On September 8th, Frankfurt a.M. and Dresden still recorded 35¬∞, on the 8th Aachen and Kleve 34¬∞, and even on the 13th numerous places still managed to heat up to 30-31¬∞, a temperature that during the four past cool years has not been reached in some places throughout the summer. Hand in hand with this came an immense drought in most parts of the country.""

""Those who doubt our climate will now be convinced for a while that Europe is not yet on the verge of a new ice age, and that the ‚Äúgood old days‚Äù were no better and no worse than the present epoch when it came to the weather. There have always been extraordinarily hot and just as abnormally cool summers, even if hot summers have been remarkably rare in recent decades. However, this is a phenomenon that can easily be explained by the unpredictability of the temperate zone climate and has long been known to meteorologists. They know very well - observations which have now extended over almost two centuries have proved this as evidence - that the cool summers, as well as the warm ones, show a pronounced tendency to appear in groups. According to Lehr's investigations into the climate of Berlin, which can confidently be regarded as applicable to the whole of northern Germany, eight cool summers followed one another in the years from 1881 to 1888 (it is true that the four summers from 1907 to 1910 were all cool yes, still remembered). Going further back in the history of the weather, one finds, in the years from 1730 to 1747, 18 cool summers that followed one another without interruption, just as fifteen warm summers formed an uninterrupted sequence from 1756 to 1770.‚Äù",climate report germany reclams universum weltrundschau one subject temperature condition last month critical examination abnormal sense new heat record set germany central europe general true temperature number german location reached shade past dog day also case previous year yes high temperature value within border german reich long ago hot august even absolute maximum temperature summer reached july chemnitz shade yet represent record since august reichenhall thermometer even risen striking remarkable extremely high maximum temperature last summer long duration almost fourweek hot period dog day tendency towards clear dry therefore also warm weather already existed since beginning spring short setback rain cold always broke anew trend towards dry hot highpressure weather persisted even end main heat wave persisted dawn autumn well september september th frankfurt dresden still recorded th aachen kleve even th numerous place still managed heat temperature four past cool year reached place throughout summer hand hand came immense drought part country doubt climate convinced europe yet verge new ice age good old day better worse present epoch came weather always extraordinarily hot abnormally cool summer even hot summer remarkably rare recent decade however phenomenon easily explained unpredictability temperate zone climate long known meteorologist know well observation extended almost two century proved evidence cool summer well warm one show pronounced tendency appear group according lehrs investigation climate berlin confidently regarded applicable whole northern germany eight cool summer followed one another year true four summer cool yes still remembered going back history weather one find year cool summer followed one another without interruption fifteen warm summer formed uninterrupted sequence

"üî•"" CLIMATE CHANGE"" is not only a giant ball of bs but it's a psyop brought about from the same people trying to enact the new world order, great reset and social credit /cbdc slave systems. There is NO 'climate change' and 'sustainability' is a fairy tale, there IS Climate POLLUTION brought about from the very industries most multi-national corporations and ultra wealthy own, such as airlines, coal burning, miltary industrial complex and above all others, ocean tanker traffic. One giant shipping tanker produces as much pollution as a large city and when they burn their 'dirty fuels' ( all the debris/oil sludge/etc most engines cannot run on), they produce as much as a large city in a tiny fraction of the time. Shipping tankers also pump out massive amounts of smoke stack soot which then blows onto lands such as Greenland and coats the ice causing it to heat up and melt. These tankers also sit off the coasts of cities and just pump out exhaust 24/7 onto the people living nearby causing untold amounts of severe respiratory health issues and cancers. On top of this serious issues of tanker traffic pollution is the badly unreported and extremely serious act of 'cloud seeding' and 'weather modification' that's been going on since the Vietnam war, all over our world. This is NOT a conspiracy theory, it's a blatant fact and IS responsible for the most insane weather effects and severe health issues suffered by people everywhere. HOW dropping aluminum dust particles over a large area is any good for anyone is insane, yet it is happening DAILY everywhere, this is also why we keep seeing massive fires all over, the aluminum dust particles ignite and increase the rapid spreading of fires massively. So please, DO SOME REAL HOMEWORK, RESEARCH and learn for yourself just how much bs this thing they call 'climate change' truly is.

My thoughts on global warming if the earth was hot during the time of the dinosaurs. Then an outside force in this case a meteor hit the earth and caused the first ice age where we got the polar ice caps. Well since the earth was hot before the meteor hit. Isn't the earth just going back to its natural climate? Since this is an unnatural climate due to an outside force of nature causing the climate change which was the meteor. In this case we are trying to slow down a natural process that's going to happen anyways because we are currently in an unnatural state by the earth natural standards.,thought global warming earth hot time dinosaur outside force case meteor hit earth caused first ice age got polar ice cap well since earth hot meteor hit isnt earth going back natural climate since unnatural climate due outside force nature causing climate change meteor case trying slow natural process thats going happen anyways currently unnatural state earth natural standard

"I am from Nepal. But I grew up in Sikkim. I grew up playing swimming in the natural spring and small creeks in North Sikkim, India. But due to the increase in population, cutting trees for wooden timber & wooden plank for building concrete houses, etc, I have seen natural springs and creeks banished from my place in Sikkim. I didn‚Äôt know about global warming and I had never been taught in detail about global warming in my school until class ‚ÄòlX‚Äô. And I was from a poor family, we did not have TV or Channel Disc to watch National Geography, Discovery Channel, or mobile phones to watch Global Warming YouTube videos.
Luckily because of Internet and YouTubes Documentaries & Videos about Global Warming & climate change, I came to know how important the issue of Global warming is. After reading some news articles, documentaries, and videos I have realized that the main problem of global warming is due to 4 reasons:
1. Increasing numbers of the population. 
2. Increasing number of skyscrapers and buildings.
3. Increasing in number of vehicles.
4. Cutting of trees.

"Seaweed farming is so far best solution for carbon removal.

It can be done in huge quantities. Mere raft is needed and then you may add seaweed to it. Having sun and perhaps some nutrients and it will grow fast.

End product is also eatable, can be given to cattle or you may make other products from it. You may also layer the rafts, so you have even more eatable products on it.

These rafts should be in open oceans. And therefore we have huge areas to grow, while our forest area is too tiny. If there is too strong storm coming, you may tow the raft away from predicted storm path.

You may also give wild life to live between these seaweed platforms. These give food, hiding places and so on for many marine species.

You may also pick local seaweed, so the ecosystem will not be harmed via invasive species.

So you have - carbon removal, large enough area to build, environmental friendly solution, ecosystem building solution, economically possible even positive and so on.

"That absolutely baffled me when Germany decided to shut down their nuclear plants. If the primary concern was greenhouse gas emissions, why shut down the power plants that don't actually produce greenhouse gas emissions? Y'all could have left the nuclear power plants up and running until your renewable infrastructure was up and ready to take over with them filling in the on-demand gaps.

Instead, Germany shut down the nuclear power plants and instead have to rely on power plants that produce greenhouse gasses to fill the gaps in their power demand - resulting in far greater greenhouse gas emissions than before! ü§¶

And frankly, there is no way to get a power grid to net zero greenhouse gas emissions that doesn't include nuclear energy. And given that fuel rods can be recycled and reused until they're no more radioactive than the background radiation rate...

"I wouldn't call it a ""heat age"" so much as an end to the ice age that humanity evolved in. We're in an interglacial period, but we do still live in an overarching ice age. Well, I suppose we don't know if it's actually going to be the end to this ice age exactly. But I honestly don't see any real efforts to put an end to human-caused climate change at this point in time. European nations are possibly the ones taking it the most seriously, but...

The Paris Climate Accord is woefully lacking. _If_ all the signatories were to actually hit their goals, it _might_ slow Climate Change down a little bit, but it's not going to stop it or really even slow it down all that much - especially given the milestones we've already reached.

Yes, I'm a pessimist. Why do you ask?

At this point, I'm of the opinion that the question of Climate Change is just how extreme it's going to get. Will we finally take action within my lifetime?

In the end, if these countries don't stop, they will grant to surpass the point of no return and ultimately kill us all.

"'If'? 'Could'? Permafrost is melting. Look at the video. Evidence right in front of our eyes.

The added greenhouse gasses are affecting atmospheric composition. There is no future possibility that changes may happen. The only future possibility, and a remote one, is that global business efforts by the West and China will ameliorate the extremes we face. Very remote.

Energy use is still increasing: SUVs, poor insulation, commuting, consumerism. 

Do the figures of 2100 include the projected emissions from Amazon rainforest collapse etc or are they only based on current emission sources?

How are the Western suburbanites going to be convinced to let go of their homes or move off-grid with localised electricity production? Or to leave cars at home? How are the Chinese going to be convinced to participate in any effort to decarbonise? 

What political or governmental action is not dictated by people's privilege on one side and national security on the other, both infused with neoliberalism? With no way to place responsibility, clearly, anywhere or on anyone, how will reductions snowball (bye, glaciers!) to where they need to be so as to reduce climate disasters?

To illustrate what this means, we have a steam train rolling off the edge of a cliff at speed. To break this metaphor, it may be possible to use Harrier jump jets and attach cables to bring the train to a less severe impact. Look over there! Norway can be completely green! Don't look at planning, policy or deregulation, no no no no.

Commentary on climate change seems to be sort of heading toward a kind of troubling future that could happen if greenhouse gasses are not drastically reduced perhaps. => 40 years of data indicates temperature rise in line with original IPCC predictions of worst case scenario. Critical: the separation of business and state, akin to the separation of church and state, is vital to achieve action.

Look over there! at this helicopter doing some tricks oh wow how scary.

What isn't scary at all is that the US and China have said words with zero matching actions so we can sleep happily knowing habitability of this planet is in the hands of people with impeccable integrity.

Look over there! at that cute little ski resort where all those affluent people won't be able to holiday anymore how sad. Ban them. 
(Yes, ban affluent people :D )

As the metaphor for runaway global culture becomes the metaphor for climate disaster, who is capable of acting, such action as Harrier jump jets to catch a train falling off a cliff? Wind power here and protecting trees there is like opening an umbrella out the window of that train. 

Fabric produced in a factory and transported can cool a building. SO can planting trees around the house or leaning bamboo and cane over the sun-facing walls. Technology isn't the only answer. Certainly not while economies collapse and the class divide widens. Maintaining GDP growth while reducing GHGs... interesting concept. How about reducing GDPs?

The Earth's climate is already heading into disarray. Why not throw multi-billion dollar bandaids at the problem? Terraforming is fun!

A brilliant step which would produce immediate results is dismantling globalisation: gradually terminate international trade and immediately ban multinational organisations. Dumping fertiliser into the oceans to create massive algae blooms would help more than ships blackening the sky, wouldn't they? How about charging fuel use on how many litres/100k a car uses rather than how many litres pumped? Or charging politician-business people with attempted genocide and throwing them in jail? 

Carbon capture and storage is proven failure technology. Ridiculous that DW included it in this presentation.

"Today, I asked  AI to make content about climate change .
I ask for something emotional and something that can touch people, and this is the results!

Dear fellow inhabitants of this fragile planet,

Today, I come to you with a plea that resonates with the very survival of our human civilization and every living creature that calls this Earth home. We stand at the precipice of a moment that will define our legacy, either as stewards of nature or architects of our own destruction. Climate change looms like an ominous shadow, threatening to engulf us, but in the darkness lies a flicker of hope ‚Äì the power of collective action.
Look around you, and you will witness the scars we have inflicted on our once-vibrant world. The consequences of our actions have extended far beyond the immediate, transforming the Earth into a wounded soul, crying out for healing. It is undeniable that human activities have accelerated the dire effects of climate change, unleashing catastrophic events that devastate communities and ecosystems alike.

The impact of climate change knows no borders. It doesn't discriminate between rich and poor, developed and developing nations. We are all bound together in this delicate tapestry of life, and the unraveling of one thread affects us all. But it is not too late to mend this tapestry and reweave a future filled with hope and promise.
Imagine a world where the air we breathe is pure, the rivers we drink from are untainted, and the wildlife roams free without fear. Picture a world where renewable energy powers our cities, where innovation and technology work hand in hand with nature, not against it.

Yet, the road to this vision is steep and challenging. Big corporations have played a significant role in the degradation of our planet, prioritizing profit over sustainability. But we, the people, hold the power to demand change. We have the ability to vote with our voices, our actions, and our wallets. Let us refuse to support businesses that continue to pollute and exploit our Earth. Let us hold them accountable for the damage they have wrought.
Each decision we make ripples through time and space, echoing in the lives of future generations. The choices we make today will define the legacy we leave behind. Do we want to be remembered as the generation that stood idly by as our planet suffered? Or will we rise as a force of change, as the champions of a brighter and greener tomorrow?

It is time to set aside our differences and unite under the banner of a sustainable future. Let us empower governments to prioritize environmental policies that safeguard our planet. Let us support green initiatives, research, and technologies that can help us tread more lightly on this Earth.

The power plants may churn, and the machines may hum, but the course of our future lies in our hands. We are the architects of our destiny, and with every decision, we can redefine what it means to coexist with nature.

Let this message echo in the depths of your hearts. Let it stir a fire within you, a fire that refuses to be extinguished until real change is achieved. Together, we can be the driving force that sparks a revolution against climate change and champions a brighter, sustainable world for all.

The time for action is now. Let us rise, let us act, and let us safeguard the future of our human civilization and every living being on this precious planet.

"Globally, TEN TIMES more people die of cold than of heat.",globally ten time people die cold heat
"As the climate heads into greater extremes globally, how can we best deal with future climate crises? 
The short answer is that we cannot deal with them unless we take care of nature's inner balance.
We live in a tightly-closed and interdependent system in which everything boomerangs back to us. While living in such a system, we need to reconsider what we want and think, and how we treat each other, because our human connections are the primary influence on how nature responds to us.
It is common to think that climate is dependent on factors outside of us‚Äîwhether it be balances between heat and cold in the environment, or the effects of various kinds of pollution we emit‚Äîbecause we lack a complete picture of how our attitudes to each other bring about the strongest responses from nature toward us.
No creature distorts nature the way that we people do. And it is not simply a matter of switching to renewable energy sources, electric cars and the like; it is a matter of how we relate to each other.
If we truly wish to witness more balance throughout nature and not have to deal with all kinds of cold waves and other natural disasters, then similarly to how we have electricity, water and gas meters in our homes, we should also have meters that count how much evil we emit into the world from our negative attitudes to each other. What I mean is that if we could feel the extent to which we emit negative forces into the world, which negatively ricochet back to us, then we would wish to change this negative driver within us. We would want to switch it to a drive that makes our human connections positive, and which harmonizes us with nature.
In simple terms, when we get up in the morning, we should first and foremost consider what we need to do in order for all people to have it good. Developing such an attitude is not so simple, yet we will need to seriously work on it as we head into the future. A life of increasing blows from nature or a life of peace and harmony depends on the extent to which we impact a shift in our attitudes to each other‚Äîfrom negative to positive.",climate head greater extreme globally best deal future climate crisis short answer deal unless take care nature inner balance live tightlyclosed interdependent system everything boomerang back u living system need reconsider want think treat human connection primary influence nature responds u common think climate dependent factor outside uswhether balance heat cold environment effect various kind pollution emitbecause lack complete picture attitude bring strongest response nature toward u creature distorts nature way people simply matter switching renewable energy source electric car like matter relate truly wish witness balance throughout nature deal kind cold wave natural disaster similarly electricity water gas meter home also meter count much evil emit world negative attitude mean could feel extent emit negative force world negatively ricochet back u would wish change negative driver within u would want switch drive make human connection positive harmonizes u nature simple term get morning first foremost consider need order people good developing attitude simple yet need seriously work head future life increasing blow nature life peace harmony depends extent impact shift attitude otherfrom negative positive

"We need to look at the green transition pragmatically, and it doesnt get more pragmatic than resource use. I dont know the specific numbers off the dome but green energy is FAR more mineral intensive than fossil fuels. It takes 15 wind turbines the size of the Washington monument to replace one 50-megawatt gas turbine. Demand for things like cobalt, llithium, manganese, rare earths, and plenty other minerals is going to exponentially increase. To meet supply it will take decades to map the necessary resources and build the mining infrastructure. Nuclear reactors, alternatively, can provide massive amounts of energy for comparatively low mineral cost in relation to wind and solar, but nuclear is unpopular in the West atm. Pure necessity might change that over time though. With the potential end of globalisation and the absurd amount of minerals needed to fuel a green economy, the net zero target by 2050 is probably a longshot. We just dont have enough minerals atm and wont for at least the next couple decades.",need look green transition pragmatically doesnt get pragmatic resource use dont know specific number dome green energy far mineral intensive fossil fuel take wind turbine size washington monument replace one megawatt gas turbine demand thing like cobalt llithium manganese rare earth plenty mineral going exponentially increase meet supply take decade map necessary resource build mining infrastructure nuclear reactor alternatively provide massive amount energy comparatively low mineral cost relation wind solar nuclear unpopular west atm pure necessity might change time though potential end globalisation absurd amount mineral needed fuel green economy net zero target probably longshot dont enough mineral atm wont least next couple decade

"A completely hopeless venture - I live in a country that is in fourth place in terms of forest area in the European Union - approximately 53% of the country's territory is forests. And what is the benefit to us as citizens of the country? 1935 we had strong agriculture and then forests were about 27%. And they also tell us that we need to live even greener, etc. industry has strict rules, because you see - they create CO2 and know what problems there are - our government signed some kind of nightmares that by 2030 we undertake to partially switch to cars with electric engines - forget it - we just had to sign something and did it - today is 2023. and it doesn't look like electric car charging points will be created in my country. Besides, if I were to switch from my Audi internal combustion engine to a very expensive electric car - then how would I charge it while living in an apartment on the fourth floor? :D
In addition, seeing the statistics - below 30% of the forest area are those countries that mass produce food products and derive income from it by exporting them to countries like mine where farmers are forced to fight for every area intended for agriculture - because they see the need to leave the forests, because some kind of global warming etc. - please Greece, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Romania, Poland, France and the other countries that do not have at least 40% of forest areas - reduce your agricultural activity, or share the profit with those countries that take care to have forests in Europe. Probably, if farmers in France are told that part of the profits must be returned to countries that take care of ecology by sacrificing their agricultural industry - I think that violent clashes would break out again in French cities.

"Watch this doc for the third time now.. I get frustrated every time I see the part abt the closing of nuclear power plants.   Closing down power plants for climate change, then open coal plants (which means mining coal is suddenly cool i guess...on top that coal need transport from carbon puking transport.. like wtf??). These coal plants do not make any near the same amount of energy, so we lack even more energy..      We are closing the solution, way before something else is even close to substitute it.  That is something which gonna destroy a lot of nature (building and installing windmills for instance) further letting out carbon, and fuel what we gonna pretend.      

We close down the solution because someone doesn't like the word nuclear, and because of waste, we would be able to find ways and solutions to store safely...and do not be a hypocrite and talk about morals around the nuclear waste, when we can store Co2 from the oil and gas industry, but nuclear waste is NO NO!   Just another joke, to say Norway (where I live) is ''so responsible'' and takes climate seriously. Do know that Norway needs more green energy, so they can KEEP searching for oil and gas - to support the screaming need for energy. The energy that lacks because of what I've already said. Btw. The windmills/new green energy they have started to install on mountains are just destroying HUUGE areas of untouched nature. 
Norway s going green to electrify the oil platforms (which sounds good) by 2030.. not stop searching for it.  Actually, they speed up the building of renewable energy sources to get out as much oil and gas as possible.  Building new platforms, for the newest record big fields... 

  The pattern is kinda obvious and clear, right.. At least - it should be for everyone telling themselves they care!   It's some cynical BS! 

Nuclear plants would be far better than making it all worse for the climate, and having a lack of energy, which again devastates people with a totally unnecessary energy crisis - which again makes people not care abt the climate at all, because everyone has enough with just paying the bills, and getting food on the tables. 

Know.. I totally agree, and support planting trees, and individuals doing what they can. Small or big. Changing the mindset is first step, but it doesn't help much to plant them when govs make it worse, rainforests is chopped down 50 times faster than trees are planted.   Like the man is saying..  1million planted by 2030 which will need decades to grow to adulthood.  By then... if we don't do anything, the amount of forrest LOST is..  non-comparable!  

So in several ways in the comment, my points are: Caring about the climate. Really caring. People can't be blind to the issues, the negatives. Just focusing on the few wins is not gonna solve things. It all goes way to fast. We are already far behind schedule..   Especially when climate change i just one crisis threatening us - on top of all the other ones.

Like I said... This really really frustrates me.. !!!",watch doc third time get frustrated every time see part abt closing nuclear power plant closing power plant climate change open coal plant mean mining coal suddenly cool guesson top coal need transport carbon puking transport like wtf coal plant make near amount energy lack even energy closing solution way something else even close substitute something gon na destroy lot nature building installing windmill instance letting carbon fuel gon na pretend close solution someone doesnt like word nuclear waste would able find way solution store safelyand hypocrite talk moral around nuclear waste store co oil gas industry nuclear waste another joke say norway live responsible take climate seriously know norway need green energy keep searching oil gas support screaming need energy energy lack ive already said btw windmillsnew green energy started install mountain destroying huuge area untouched nature norway going green electrify oil platform sound good stop searching actually speed building renewable energy source get much oil gas possible building new platform newest record big field pattern kinda obvious clear right least everyone telling care cynical b nuclear plant would far better making worse climate lack energy devastates people totally unnecessary energy crisis make people care abt climate everyone enough paying bill getting food table know totally agree support planting tree individual small big changing mindset first step doesnt help much plant govs make worse rainforest chopped time faster tree planted like man saying million planted need decade grow adulthood dont anything amount forrest lost noncomparable several way comment point caring climate really caring people cant blind issue negative focusing win gon na solve thing go way fast already far behind schedule especially climate change one crisis threatening u top one like said really really frustrates

"The planet is heating from the inside out because of the 400 yr Grand Solar Minimum's  reduction in the planet's magfield which allows more solar/galactic cosmic rays to pass through the earth and the muons interact with and heat the magma, thus the increase in volcanic and earthquake activity. The continental plates are pushing into the Archaean cratons which are the stable remnants of Earth's early continental lithosphere that are twice as deep as the rest of the planet's mantle. The Archaean cratons are the mass of the planet 4.5+ billion years ago when the Earth was only 1/5 the size of it is now. The pushing of the continental plates into the cratons creates the spontaneous fires breaking out at the same time in the northern forests (Canada) due to methane release and earthquakes (and oil/gas drilling. The northern forests always burn off prior to the ice age proper...and now we know that lower solar output of the larger epi-cycles 400 yrs and 100,000 yrs creates mini and mega ice ages.

"Artificial intelligence (AI) can play a crucial role in combating climate change by offering innovative solutions to regulate temperatures and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Here are some examples of AI solutions that can help regulate temperatures in relation to the issue of global warming:

Forecasting and management of renewable energies: AI can be used to predict the production of renewable energies such as solar and wind energy, which are inherently intermittent. By using machine learning models, forecasts can be improved, enabling better integration of renewable energy sources into the power grid. This helps balance the supply and demand of electricity, contributing to the regularization of energy consumption.

Optimization of energy consumption: AI can analyze energy consumption patterns in buildings, industries, and cities. By identifying energy inefficiencies, AI can recommend adjustments to reduce energy consumption, thereby reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with electricity production.

Smart agriculture: AI can monitor and predict agricultural conditions, such as periods of drought or flooding. By identifying optimal times for planting, irrigating, or harvesting, farmers can better manage their crops to maintain yields while avoiding excessive water and resource use, helping regulate agricultural ecosystems and mitigate the impact of climate change.

Advanced climate modeling: AI can improve the accuracy of climate models by incorporating a larger amount of data and optimizing model parameters. More accurate climate models help better understand long-term climate trends and identify high-risk areas for adaptation measures.

Monitoring and prevention of natural disasters: AI can help monitor extreme weather events such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods. By analyzing real-time data, AI can more accurately predict hurricane trajectories or estimate the potential damage caused by a natural disaster. This enables better preparedness, strengthens infrastructure resilience, and saves lives.

Intelligent transportation: AI can contribute to improving transport efficiency by optimizing routes, promoting public transportation, and facilitating the adoption of autonomous electric vehicles. More efficient mobility helps reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector.

These examples demonstrate how the judicious use of artificial intelligence can contribute to regulating temperatures in the fight against climate change. However, it is essential to note that AI is not a singular solution to the problem of climate change but rather a powerful tool to combine with other efforts, such as adopting effective climate policies and engaging society in the transition to a sustainable economy.",artificial intelligence ai play crucial role combating climate change offering innovative solution regulate temperature reduce greenhouse gas emission example ai solution help regulate temperature relation issue global warming forecasting management renewable energy ai used predict production renewable energy solar wind energy inherently intermittent using machine learning model forecast improved enabling better integration renewable energy source power grid help balance supply demand electricity contributing regularization energy consumption optimization energy consumption ai analyze energy consumption pattern building industry city identifying energy inefficiency ai recommend adjustment reduce energy consumption thereby reducing greenhouse gas emission associated electricity production smart agriculture ai monitor predict agricultural condition period drought flooding identifying optimal time planting irrigating harvesting farmer better manage crop maintain yield avoiding excessive water resource use helping regulate agricultural ecosystem mitigate impact climate change advanced climate modeling ai improve accuracy climate model incorporating larger amount data optimizing model parameter accurate climate model help better understand longterm climate trend identify highrisk area adaptation measure monitoring prevention natural disaster ai help monitor extreme weather event hurricane earthquake flood analyzing realtime data ai accurately predict hurricane trajectory estimate potential damage caused natural disaster enables better preparedness strengthens infrastructure resilience save life intelligent transportation ai contribute improving transport efficiency optimizing route promoting public transportation facilitating adoption autonomous electric vehicle efficient mobility help reduce greenhouse gas emission transportation sector example demonstrate judicious use artificial intelligence contribute regulating temperature fight climate change however essential note ai singular solution problem climate change rather powerful tool combine effort adopting effective climate policy engaging society transition sustainable economy

"By volume, the Earth's CO2 represents around 0.04 percent in the atmosphere. And of this 0.04 percent CO2, 95 percent of this amount comes from natural sources. Thus, the human CO2 content in the air only equates to about 0.0016 percent.  There is no way CO2 can be in this small amount a serious problem.  CO2 absorbs only a tiny portion of energy (the narrow area under the curve) as compared to water vapor.  The heating of air by absorbing heat from the ground cools the Earth as it warms the air.  According to the laws of physics, there is no net increase in heat. It's just the movement of the sun's water heat into the air as a phase transition.",volume earth co represents around percent atmosphere percent co percent amount come natural source thus human co content air equates percent way co small amount serious problem co absorbs tiny portion energy narrow area curve compared water vapor heating air absorbing heat ground cool earth warms air according law physic net increase heat movement sun water heat air phase transition

"Covered in green - yes, all the bare surfaces of farms that are tilled up producing veg and grain are conventionally left bare and sprayed to keep any life off thousands of millions of acres when they aren't growing a cash crop. To promote cover crops before, after, and during cash crops, the farmlands could pull down more carbon than the production that goes up into the atmosphere. Livestock could graze to terminate the cover crops and it would reduce feedlots which cause waste, but having the animals fertilize where they eat means there are no toxic anaerobic ponds of waste. Instead the animals are fertilizing the farmland in a way earthworms and dung beetles can breakdown the manure.",covered green yes bare surface farm tilled producing veg grain conventionally left bare sprayed keep life thousand million acre arent growing cash crop promote cover crop cash crop farmland could pull carbon production go atmosphere livestock could graze terminate cover crop would reduce feedlot cause waste animal fertilize eat mean toxic anaerobic pond waste instead animal fertilizing farmland way earthworm dung beetle breakdown manure

There is no scientific evidence that CO2 has increased by 60% over and above any historical previous CO2 levels.  CO2 is 0.04% of the planet's atmosphere. This would make it impossible to claim that 30 years ago the technologility we have today was used in the same tests as 30 Years ago.  All the CO2 data from 30 years ago was found to be false, Therefore unless you are using the same equipment to do the same tests, not only will you have false data, but equally false new data.",thanks reporting issue misinformation timestamp selected additional detail scientific evidence co increased historical previous co level co planet atmosphere would make impossible claim year ago technologility today used test year ago co data year ago found false therefore unless using equipment test false data equally false new data

"The ice age is still melting, the less ice left the faster it heats. We also need to focus on air quality and land restoration. We may have accelerated the global warming but it was accelerating itself anyhow. The best we can do now is to consume less, restore more land, change current mono crop farming techniques for permaculture farming across the planet. The problem is that there is little in the way of income in these fields of work. People are naturally competitive so it is not easy to expect people to become competitive in what they can do to fix what they have damaged because the entire reason they damaged it was to profit in the 1st place. People like the idea of doing something to repair the world but we tend to wait till after the problem has caused disaster and then we act, usually too late. Why do we have to wait till the event? Are we not intelligent enough to try to average out the curve of cycles such as these? Even if we were i highly doubt we could achieve what is needed to be done to make a big difference. However we should be trying harder. Personalty i don't have much faith in the people to do what is needed to make such an effort. I discuss similar scenarios in public and 95% of people are just not interested. We also need to consider the power of nationalism.

"This is no surprise. Shocking, yes, but no surprise. Why? IPCC reports recently admitted that while we may only be experiencing +1.3C, which already feels and appears to be catastrophic, we are actually already at +2.0C of global heating - and the ocean has soaked up 90% of the heat.

How is that possible? Because aerosol particulates, SO2, & SOx released by burning fossil fuels are shrouding the Earth and protecting us from the extra + 0.70C of global heating, but as soon as we stop burning fossil fuels, there will be a hellish jump up to √∑2.0C or more.  This is called the ""Aerosol Effect"".

Moreover, this is no surprise because science shows that every time in the past 5 million years that the earth has hit 400 PPM of CO2 we bake in +2.0C to +3.0C of global heating.  That‚Äôs just how it works. We are now at 421 PPM and adding +2.6 PPM each year.  So we're in a kind of catch-22 predicament with only lethal options. 

We must do everything we can to stop burning carbon-based fuels and when we do burn them, we must capture all the CO2.

The ocean heating we're seeing around Florida may seem stunning, but it's no surprise because the ocean has absorbed 90% of the heat that we have dumped into it with our greenhouse gases and all the burning of our fossil fuels. 

How much? The equivalent of 1.5 BILLION Hiroshima bombs of heat per second for the past 20 years. That's 4 per second @ 86,400 seconds per day... That's an unbelievable amount of heat that the ocean has soaked up and it is now at a Tipping Point from both ocean Heating and acidity which is destroying so much of what we know of as life in the ocean.

Finally, the ocean produces 50% of Earth's oxygen, and the fact is that since 1950 we've lost over half of the oxygen-producing capacity of the ocean, and it's getting worse year by year. 

All of these scientific facts should terrify us, and drive us to make all changes in our energy and civilization necessary to build a survivable and sustainable future for Humanity and all life on Earth.",surprise shocking yes surprise ipcc report recently admitted may experiencing c already feel appears catastrophic actually already c global heating ocean soaked heat possible aerosol particulate sox released burning fossil fuel shrouding earth protecting u extra c global heating soon stop burning fossil fuel hellish jump c called aerosol effect moreover surprise science show every time past million year earth hit ppm co bake c c global heating thats work ppm adding ppm year kind catch predicament lethal option must everything stop burning carbonbased fuel burn must capture co ocean heating seeing around florida may seem stunning surprise ocean absorbed heat dumped greenhouse gas burning fossil fuel much equivalent billion hiroshima bomb heat per second past year thats per second second per day thats unbelievable amount heat ocean soaked tipping point ocean heating acidity destroying much know life ocean finally ocean produce earth oxygen fact since weve lost half oxygenproducing capacity ocean getting worse year year scientific fact terrify u drive u make change energy civilization necessary build survivable sustainable future humanity life earth

""The most robust global changes in climate extremes are found in yearly values of heatwaves (number of days, maximum duration and cumulated heat), while global trends in heatwave intensity are not significant. Daily precipitation intensity and extreme precipitation frequency are stationary in the main part of the weather stations. Trend analysis of the time series of tropical cyclones show a substantial temporal invariance and the same is true for tornadoes in the USA. At the same time, the impact of warming on surface wind speed remains unclear. The analysis is then extended to some global response indicators of extreme meteorological events, namely natural disasters, floods, droughts, ecosystem productivity and yields of the four main crops (maize, rice, soybean and wheat). None of these response indicators show a clear positive trend of extreme events. In conclusion on the basis of observational data, the climate crisis that, according to many sources, we are experiencing today, is not evident yet."" (Alimonti, et al. 2022. The European Physical Journal Plus, Volume 137.)

"Our understanding of climate change is often influenced more by politics and the bandwagon effect rather than solid scientific evidence. While weather variability can be both dangerous and beneficial, it is important to consider certain factors to gain a clearer understanding.

For instance, the latitude comparison between Furnace Creek in California and Mount Everest's summit in Nepal shows that despite being closer to the equator, Mount Everest is consistently colder. This suggests that the gaseous composition of atmospheres does not significantly affect average surface temperatures.

To illustrate this point, we can look at Venus. Despite it having an atmosphere primarily composed of 96.5% carbon dioxide, much higher than Earth's 0.04%, it is not essential to predict temperature. While we are taught that Venus' carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere creates a strong greenhouse effect, recent evidence suggests that its proximity to the Sun and the weight of its atmosphere contribute more significantly to its scorching surface temperatures rather than a greenhouse effect. The immense atmospheric pressure on Venus generates intense heat.

Considering this, it can be concluded that atmospheric gases only contribute to warming through their physical mass, which then increases atmospheric pressure. This explains why the top of Mount Everest is consistently colder than the bottom of Death Valley, as lower pressure corresponds to lower temperatures while higher pressure corresponds to higher temperatures.

With knowledge of two key details ‚Äì the distance from the Sun and atmospheric pressure ‚Äì scientists can accurately predict average surface temperatures of all the rocky planets and moons in our solar system. This prediction method has proven successful for various celestial bodies, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Pluto, our Moon, and others to within one degree Celsius. This mathematical relationship, like the value of Pi, is a natural constant, not a human invention.

Contrary to popular belief, the concept of a ""greenhouse gas effect,"" where our atmosphere acts as a transparent barrier trapping heat, is not supported by real-world evidence. Our Earth does not possess a roof that prevents heat from escaping into space, so heat can easily dissipate.

Unfortunately, politicians have influenced the field of climate science by funding predetermined research conclusions. This has transformed natural climate variations into a religious belief system and unfairly labeled carbon as our Original Sin. However, it is the collective atomic mass of gases in our atmosphere that generates a significant pressure-heating effect.

For further insight, I recommend watching the short YouTube video, ""Carbon Dioxide in a bottle greenhouse gas experiment exposed"". Additionally, the full-length movie ""Climate Catholicism and Greenhouse Dreams"" provides a comprehensive understanding of the climate debate.",understanding climate change often influenced politics bandwagon effect rather solid scientific evidence weather variability dangerous beneficial important consider certain factor gain clearer understanding instance latitude comparison furnace creek california mount everest summit nepal show despite closer equator mount everest consistently colder suggests gaseous composition atmosphere significantly affect average surface temperature illustrate point look venus despite atmosphere primarily composed carbon dioxide much higher earth essential predict temperature taught venus carbon dioxiderich atmosphere creates strong greenhouse effect recent evidence suggests proximity sun weight atmosphere contribute significantly scorching surface temperature rather greenhouse effect immense atmospheric pressure venus generates intense heat considering concluded atmospheric gas contribute warming physical mass increase atmospheric pressure explains top mount everest consistently colder bottom death valley lower pressure corresponds lower temperature higher pressure corresponds higher temperature knowledge two key detail distance sun atmospheric pressure scientist accurately predict average surface temperature rocky planet moon solar system prediction method proven successful various celestial body mercury venus earth mar pluto moon others within one degree celsius mathematical relationship like value pi natural constant human invention contrary popular belief concept greenhouse gas effect atmosphere act transparent barrier trapping heat supported realworld evidence earth possess roof prevents heat escaping space heat easily dissipate unfortunately politician influenced field climate science funding predetermined research conclusion transformed natural climate variation religious belief system unfairly labeled carbon original sin however collective atomic mass gas atmosphere generates significant pressureheating effect insight recommend watching short youtube video carbon dioxide bottle greenhouse gas experiment exposed additionally fulllength movie climate catholicism greenhouse dream provides comprehensive understanding climate debate

"Climate change is a lie. All anyone has to do is read God's Word to us the Holy Bible to know the truth and stop freaking out. God, Who created everything, tells us in His Word to us the Holy Bible that; Genesis 8:22 ""While the earth remains, Seedtime and harvest, Cold and heat, Winter and summer, And day and night shall not cease."" It is also meaningless for us to think that we can ""save"" the earth or ""sustain"" the planet because God also tells us in His Word to us the Bible that He is going to destroy the current heavens and earth and create new pristine ones (Isaiah 65:17) for all people who have repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their Savior Who died and resurrected to pay for their sins for them, to live in for the rest of eternity reconciled with God (Heaven).

The truth that we must be concerned with is that all of us and our loved ones are spiritually prepared for our ETERNAL LIFE, BEFORE we die by repenting of our sins and being spiritually born again by Gods Holy Spirit by believing the Gospel of Jesus Christ in the Bible and accepting Jesus Christ as our Savior by believing that Jesus was God on earth Who was born one of us to die and resurrect from the dead, to defeat eternal death for us, to take the punishment for our sins for us to reconcile us sinners with God to give us eternal life with Him, believing also that Jesus is coming back again at the end of this world to set up His eternal heavenly kingdom.

THE GOSPEL (THE GOOD NEWS) OF JESUS CHRIST OUR LORD AND SAVIOR-

Jesus Christ came down here from heaven, God on earth, to be born one of us His own creation and He dwelt among us for over three decades and He taught us about God and His eternal heavenly kingdom and how to live righteously and He lived a perfect sinless life. Then He gave His sinless life to all people from all nations to pay for our sins for us, by dying on the cross and resurrecting from the dead three days later, to defeat eternal death for us, to take the punishment for our sins for us to reconcile us sinners with God, to give us eternal life with Him, and after He resurrected from the dead He lived on earth for forty more days, speaking to many people, then He ascended back up into heaven and He is coming back again at the end of this world to set up His eternal heavenly kingdom and all people who BEFORE they die have repented of their sins and accepted Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior Who died and resurrected to pay for their sins for them, will be FORGIVEN of their sins and have eternal life reconciled with God.",climate change lie anyone read god word u holy bible know truth stop freaking god created everything tell u word u holy bible genesis earth remains seedtime harvest cold heat winter summer day night shall cease also meaningless u think save earth sustain planet god also tell u word u bible going destroy current heaven earth create new pristine one isaiah people repented sin accepted jesus christ savior died resurrected pay sin live rest eternity reconciled god heaven truth must concerned u loved one spiritually prepared eternal life die repenting sin spiritually born god holy spirit believing gospel jesus christ bible accepting jesus christ savior believing jesus god earth born one u die resurrect dead defeat eternal death u take punishment sin u reconcile u sinner god give u eternal life believing also jesus coming back end world set eternal heavenly kingdom gospel good news jesus christ lord savior jesus christ came heaven god earth born one u creation dwelt among u three decade taught u god eternal heavenly kingdom live righteously lived perfect sinless life gave sinless life people nation pay sin u dying cross resurrecting dead three day later defeat eternal death u take punishment sin u reconcile u sinner god give u eternal life resurrected dead lived earth forty day speaking many people ascended back heaven coming back end world set eternal heavenly kingdom people die repented sin accepted jesus christ lord savior died resurrected pay sin forgiven sin eternal life reconciled god
