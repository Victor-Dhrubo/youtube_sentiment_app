"""when we create reasons for ourselves to become this kind of person rather than that. we wholeheartedly become the people that we are"" But what are the bases for creating reasons to become a banker rather than to become an artist, say? Don't I need to know myself, know my values? If there is a better or worse or equally good answer to this question about who I am or what my values are, then isn't it not a hard choice anymore? (And if this is a wrong question to ask since there is no ""self"" and we can create ourselves ex nihilo, then there is nothing wrong with being a drifter.) Perhaps what defines hard choices is not that the options are on a par, but that the yardstick to compare the options is unclear - the person does not know herself or her values (well enough).",create reason become kind person rather wholeheartedly become people base creating reason become banker rather become artist say dont need know know value better worse equally good answer question value isnt hard choice anymore wrong question ask since self create ex nihilo nothing wrong drifter perhaps defines hard choice option par yardstick compare option unclear person know value well enough,1.0
"You don't ""create"" reasons, sorry Post Modernism. Reasons exist and you choose which to focus on and follow. I choose not to get diabetes from my breakfast vs to feel good in the moment. You can measure those results scientifically with health and longevity markers like nutrition content & their functions in the body vs dopamine markers or inflammation. Those reasons are both based on objective reality, that exists (thanks, Enlightenment! <3) But my subjectivity and free will is in how I craft and navigate my life and responses, in relation to reality and my own sense of self, values, dreams, etc. Pretending that we ""create"" rather than recognize the reasons ourselves is not only delusional but quite narcissistic.

"My best interpretation of the talk:

You have to decide what values are more important for you, what you are going to value. You create value in the process of making such choices. Think of a baby/kid that makes certain choices about hobbies, food. He/she creates reasons in the process of making a choice. We will not tell our kid that he/she should do the hobby/study that best fits his/her values, we will motivate him/her to make a choice and see that choice as a step in becoming a person. Same for adults. So it's not so much about discovering reasons/which are the best reasons but rather creating reasons. in making a choice, you rather create reasons (or value) than passively discover and follow existing reasons (related to values). When reason tells you that both options are equally valuable, accept that both options are fine, use your intuition or feeling to decide which is really ok (or flip a coin if you want, whatever you want), and stop thinking about discovering reasons but focus on valuing/being attached to your choice.

does this make sense?",best interpretation talk decide value important going value create value process making choice think babykid make certain choice hobby food heshe creates reason process making choice tell kid heshe hobbystudy best fit hisher value motivate himher make choice see choice step becoming person adult much discovering reasonswhich best reason rather creating reason making choice rather create reason value passively discover follow existing reason related value reason tell option equally valuable accept option fine use intuition feeling decide really ok flip coin want whatever want stop thinking discovering reason focus valuingbeing attached choice make sense,0.0

"Hard-choice is still just a choice. It's only hard to choose if we don't know the end goal, who we are, or where we are supposed to be. 

But if you already know, it'll be easy, cause if it's still going there anyway any option is fine.
Maybe pick the one that's faster, or slower, closer or further, depending on our own taste which comes from how we define ourselves. 

You might like it slow and enjoy the process or fast and just get to the end point.
It's all up to you and your definition.

"It's not that there is no best choice among multiple options; it‚Äôs that we are incapable of ever knowing which choice it is. 

Perhaps God does.

The stumbling block for us is our belief that we can ever know which was which. All that we can know is whether our choice worked out well for us or not. But we can never know it was the better or worse choice.

Like in the parable of the Chinese farmer and his son. Wherein every day something happens to the farmer and his son and every day his neighbors come and pronounce judgment on the event. ""Too Bad,‚Äù they say one day about one event. Then,  ‚ÄúHow lucky you are,"" the next day about a different event. After each pronouncement the farmer ambivalently replies, ‚ÄúWe'll see.""

"All things being equal this talk makes a lot of sense. However what is not mentioned here is first you must survive and to do that you need income. We are faced with the obligation to do whatever work we can obtain to put food in our stomachs. While remembering that we do not live to put food in our stomachs we live to put nourishment into our souls. Do what you have to do but be focused on being who you are. Becoming who you are is what we live for. But we get caught up don't we. We start identifying with our menial work and we start believing that is all we are. Which is not so! Suppose I want to be a yacht builder but I have no skills to build. I must eat. So I take a job that I can do to get food and I use the rest of my time working on becoming a yacht builder. This is the way. But maybe not... Perhaps I should become a yacht builder today and hope that the journey will bear fruit along the way, enough to keep me supported.

"Interesting approach. I can't agree, however. I feel like the message is to just make up whatever you want in order to justify a hard choice. This might be okay for a choice that affects only you, but do we want to empower our leaders to operate this way. I don't. Choices that are hard are not incomparable.  They are hard because there are either competing objectives at play, uncertainty in the consequences or outcomes of each possible alternative, or a struggle between the trade-offs that would result from the choice. You can compare them using multiple objective analyses which are designed to address this very difficulty of bringing competing values into the decision. While there may not be a ""best"" choice in a traditional sense, there most certainly is an ""optimal"" choice if you work hard at defining all of the different fundamental objectives underlying the decision as step 1 (even and especially those objectives that compete with one another) rather than just calling the decision hard and leaving it at that.  Being an artist might be better on life fulfillment and worse on financial stability, but how we value life fulfillment in comparison to financial stability and our risk tolerance come into play to help show that one choice really is optimal over another, depending on how these values are held by the decision-maker.",interesting approach cant agree however feel like message make whatever want order justify hard choice might okay choice affect want empower leader operate way dont choice hard incomparable hard either competing objective play uncertainty consequence outcome possible alternative struggle tradeoff would result choice compare using multiple objective analysis designed address difficulty bringing competing value decision may best choice traditional sense certainly optimal choice work hard defining different fundamental objective underlying decision step even especially objective compete one another rather calling decision hard leaving artist might better life fulfillment worse financial stability value life fulfillment comparison financial stability risk tolerance come play help show one choice really optimal another depending value held decisionmaker,1.0
"I can cope with most of the hard choices, except being married or not married. I love someone and I spent a lot of years with her. She wants to get married now, but sometimes I think that she is not the right person, and sometimes I think that she is the best person for getting married. Also, both of our time is very limited for that decision due to some career reasons. I fear that my decisions will become my mistakes one day in the future in retrospect. Also, I think about her life with big mercy. Like, what will she do after me, could she get married(because of some old memories)? On the other hand, I sometimes feel bad about her personal attitude as she fights a lot and makes things big. Therefore, I think getting married to her can be a disaster.

"What if you choose based on who you feel you are/ want to become, and it still doesn't work out, based on factors you couldn't foresee: an example, a few years ago I adopted a ten year old rescue dog, it was taking a leap of faith because I have 5 beloved cats at home (but love dogs and used to have them until they died of old age) -- I brought the rescue dog home and it became clear, despite going about the introductions in as slow a way as I had read was necessary/ separating them but allowing them to see one another etc., the dog would have killed my cats (despite being told at the shelter he was good with cats). I contacted a trainer to see what was possible and she said it was unsafe since the dog was older, this cat reactivity was unlikely to change and even if it could it would be a long stressful time for the cats and the dog, and I should bring the dog back to the shelter. This was something unimaginable but what I ended up having to do for the safety of my cats and also so the dog could have a chance at a loving, cat free home. Now, if I want to try to adopt a dog again, and choose based on who I am/ want to become, which is an animal lover who wants to say ""yes"" to animals who need a home as long as I can keep up with all their needs, I have this past experience that tells me, you can choose based on your own becoming but it doesn't necessarily mean it will feel like the better choice once the unforeseens become visible.

"Ruth Chang says that hard choices are hard because none of the alternatives is way better than the other. Therefore, even small choices can be hard. Whether to have chocolate ice cream or creme brulee can be a very hard choice indeed, if I like them both and if I am craving for sweets at that moment.  So what do we do? We take the safest option.

We decide to become engineers than artists because statistically, the probability of getting a job as an engineer is higher than that of an artist. So, we take the safest option, because we fear that we are too stupid to understand the better option if the choice to make is hard. We prefer not to take any risks and we go for the option that is rationally comforting.

This is the very mistake we make. Remember, in hard choices no option is better than the other. We simply do not know‚Ä¶How can we know that engineering makes us happier in our future lives? Unfortunately, there are no fast forward and rewind buttons for life. So, does it really make sense to conclude that engineering is the better option?

"Summary: Hard choices are those where neither alternative is better overall, hence difficult to choose between. A choice may be hard but at the same time unimportant, like choosing food from menu. Also, for important hard choices, the outcome is often unknown, which makes them harder.

Don't have naive scientific attitude and try to put choices on a linear scale of good and bad. Complex numbers and entanglement are just few examples of incomparable or unquantifiable things in science. Just imagine how hard life must be.

The thing is- there is no rationally good or bad alternative in hard choices. If everything could be rationalized, then we would be reduced to automaton. In other words, instead of being episodes of agony, hard choices are opportunity for us to express our consciousness, and be the person we are.",summary hard choice neither alternative better overall hence difficult choose choice may hard time unimportant like choosing food menu also important hard choice outcome often unknown make harder dont naive scientific attitude try put choice linear scale good bad complex number entanglement example incomparable unquantifiable thing science imagine hard life must thing rationally good bad alternative hard choice everything could rationalized would reduced automaton word instead episode agony hard choice opportunity u express consciousness person,1.0

"This video for me missed out something fundamental idea that supports her discourse on how to make hard choices. Its quite deceiving to make a choice if you will not 'know more about the choices that you will be choosing'.

It does not sound like she could have been happy with the lawyer choice, given her personality and value structure.

"hmmm.. This helped me, but only because I thought about it through for a while. 


The core of what she was saying is good, but I feel like it was kind of diluted with things that actually detracted from the point. Someone in the comments said, ""Just make a choice, then make so that it turns out to be a good one"". I understand why they came to this conclusion based on this video. I think that people like this would have clearer understandings had the video beed a lot more direct. I'm gonna break it down in my own words and it might help people.


For me, the important part is when she mentioned ""Drifters"". A drifter is someone who's aimless and subsequently doesn't no who they are. To understand who you are, it's important to be able to recognize meaning. (Look up ""Jordan Peterson Meaning"") Defining yourself, your goals, your principles, allows you to recognize the choices that yield the most meaning from the consequences of your decisions.


That's it. I don't think this adds to what she said, it might make her point clearer though. idk. Also, keep in mind that Jordan Peterson is politically controversial, but has a great life philosophy and I'd encourage anyone to look him up as he's very important to this. I like a lot of what she had to say, ""If your life were nothing but easy choices, you'd be a slave to your decisions.""

For example when choosing a dress eventhough you perceive both of your dress as beautiful and worth-wearing, you still have a hard time in chosing so you ask which one is better. 
True that in the end you're the one who will make the decision for yourself ""look inside"" ""who am i to be? "" but in the end We dont really know the ones which are good for us so we ask advice from PEOPLE who matters to us, the ones we loved. 

You see as an Asian being ""Practical"" routes to our family decissions and YOUR OWN PERSONALITY clashing in between them WILL make it hard for you. So you see, Even if My mindset say BOTH CHOICES I MAKE IS EQUALLY GOOD, SOCIETY will still Slap me on the face,my family, my friends, MY own fear, WILL MAKE IT HARD FOR ME TO ACCOMMODATE OR PERCEIVE EACH ONE OF my CHOICES AS BOTH GOOD. And Because EVERYONE WILL SAY that when choosing ""CHOOSE WHICH ONE IS BETTER"" SO IN THE END It will lead me think that choosing between finance and art, FINANCE is better as a job than being a graphical artist.

I agree with the idea that there's no way to apply quantitative comparisons to values and so we can't say that an option is better than another. I also agree with the consideration that hard choices are chances to shape ourselves as we want to be in our life.
But, in my opinion, the real problem is here: what is the best choice if I want to be like THAT?
So many times we know what we want from life, but we can't figure out the best path to get to it. I can listen to myself, to the emotional part of me, to understand what I really want from life, what I desire, so I know how I want to shape myself, but I don't know what tools I have to choose to obtain this shape.",perplexity talk deal finding concrete solution problem speaker figured brilliant way problem fundamental issue lie end speech didnt feel like got new way face hard choice agree idea there way apply quantitative comparison value cant say option better another also agree consideration hard choice chance shape want life opinion real problem best choice want like many time know want life cant figure best path get listen emotional part understand really want life desire know want shape dont know tool choose obtain shape,1.0

"I don't necessarily agree. It's always best to make decisions based on as much research as possible - this helps us see the choices for as much as they actually are. She's making out most life decisions are on a par - which they are not. For example, I love art and I love maths. I love art a bit more.

I don't ""see myself"" as a banker, at all, but ultimately, it's the better choice for me as I'll be OK financially.

I find it notoriously difficult to make choices (paralysis by analysis), but one thing that helped me to become better was:

- Research, find the answers then make the decision (let it make itself)

DON'T

- Make the decision based on feelings and then find the answers to justify it

I think everything is numerically quantifiable, but a scientific approach is not always the most efficient. I really do believe if you spent enough time you could make the right choice scientifically, using all the information at your disposal. This would take waay too long and you're better off just 'feeling' what's best for you.


Her last point was 'making reasons'. She said that hard choices allow you the opportunity to recreate yourself in your decision.

"Her basic premise is wrong. She asserts hard choices are hard because they're equally good, with no evidence to support that. If there is anything at all to support making one decision over another, it is the better option.

Overrall she comes off as a wannabe decision theorist.",basic premise wrong asserts hard choice hard theyre equally good evidence support anything support making one decision another better option also separate inner want material desire reason doesnt understand basic math science dichotomizing realm science completely separate value according basically irrational overrall come wannabe decision theorist,1.0
