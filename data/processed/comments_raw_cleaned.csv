How?
Well, something has been introduced into us that we ran to recently because of a scare.  Ask yourself what was it?  Well, it shut down everything under the guise of health emergency people.  Why did they do this?  To control:
Population.
Banking

"My best interpretation of the talk:

You have to decide what values are more important for you, what you are going to value. You create value in the process of making such choices. Think of a baby/kid that makes certain choices about hobbies, food. He/she creates reasons in the process of making a choice. We will not tell our kid that he/she should do the hobby/study that best fits his/her values, we will motivate him/her to make a choice and see that choice as a step in becoming a person. Same for adults. So it's not so much about discovering reasons/which are the best reasons but rather creating reasons. in making a choice, you rather create reasons (or value) than passively discover and follow existing reasons (related to values). When reason tells you that both options are equally valuable, accept that both options are fine, use your intuition or feeling to decide which is really ok (or flip a coin if you want, whatever you want), and stop thinking about discovering reasons but focus on valuing/being attached to your choice.

does this make sense?",best interpretation talk decide value important going value create value process making choice think babykid make certain choice hobby food heshe creates reason process making choice tell kid heshe hobbystudy best fit hisher value motivate himher make choice see choice step becoming person adult much discovering reasonswhich best reason rather creating reason making choice rather create reason value passively discover follow existing reason related value reason tell option equally valuable accept option fine use intuition feeling decide really ok flip coin want whatever want stop thinking discovering reason focus valuingbeing attached choice make sense

I thought this was brilliant. The premise as I took it is that decisions should be based on personal values and be more about the kind of person you want to become vs. an optimal solution. The problem I still have is what if you have to juxoppose two mutually exclusive values when you want to embody both. That is difficult but then again this is where she is talking about having to define yourself one way or the other.,thought brilliant premise took decision based personal value kind person want become v optimal solution problem still juxoppose two mutually exclusive value want embody difficult talking define one way

"It's not that there is no best choice among multiple options; it‚Äôs that we are incapable of ever knowing which choice it is. 

Perhaps God does.

The stumbling block for us is our belief that we can ever know which was which. All that we can know is whether our choice worked out well for us or not. But we can never know it was the better or worse choice.

Like in the parable of the Chinese farmer and his son. Wherein every day something happens to the farmer and his son and every day his neighbors come and pronounce judgment on the event. ""Too Bad,‚Äù they say one day about one event. Then,  ‚ÄúHow lucky you are,"" the next day about a different event. After each pronouncement the farmer ambivalently replies, ‚ÄúWe'll see."" With each new day revealing the neighbors' judgments, no matter what they were, were wrong.",best choice among multiple option incapable ever knowing choice perhaps god stumbling block u belief ever know know whether choice worked well u never know better worse choice like parable chinese farmer son wherein every day something happens farmer son every day neighbor come pronounce judgment event bad say one day one event lucky next day different event pronouncement farmer ambivalently reply well see new day revealing neighbor judgment matter wrong

"Interesting approach. I can't agree, however. I feel like the message is to just make up whatever you want in order to justify a hard choice. This might be okay for a choice that affects only you, but do we want to empower our leaders to operate this way. I don't. Choices that are hard are not incomparable.  They are hard because there are either competing objectives at play, uncertainty in the consequences or outcomes of each possible alternative, or a struggle between the trade-offs that would result from the choice. You can compare them using multiple objective analyses which are designed to address this very difficulty of bringing competing values into the decision. While there may not be a ""best"" choice in a traditional sense, there most certainly is an ""optimal"" choice if you work hard at defining all of the different fundamental objectives underlying the decision as step 1 (even and especially those objectives that compete with one another) rather than just calling the decision hard and leaving it at that.  Being an artist might be better on life fulfillment and worse on financial stability, but how we value life fulfillment in comparison to financial stability and our risk tolerance come into play to help show that one choice really is optimal over another, depending on how these values are held by the decision-maker.",interesting approach cant agree however feel like message make whatever want order justify hard choice might okay choice affect want empower leader operate way dont choice hard incomparable hard either competing objective play uncertainty consequence outcome possible alternative struggle tradeoff would result choice compare using multiple objective analysis designed address difficulty bringing competing value decision may best choice traditional sense certainly optimal choice work hard defining different fundamental objective underlying decision step even especially objective compete one another rather calling decision hard leaving artist might better life fulfillment worse financial stability value life fulfillment comparison financial stability risk tolerance come play help show one choice really optimal another depending value held decisionmaker

Also, I think about her life with big mercy. Like, what will she do after me, could she get married(because of some old memories)?

"What if you choose based on who you feel you are/ want to become, and it still doesn't work out, based on factors you couldn't foresee: an example, a few years ago I adopted a ten year old rescue dog, it was taking a leap of faith because I have 5 beloved cats at home (but love dogs and used to have them until they died of old age) -- I brought the rescue dog home and it became clear, despite going about the introductions in as slow a way as I had read was necessary/ separating them but allowing them to see one another etc., the dog would have killed my cats (despite being told at the shelter he was good with cats). I contacted a trainer to see what was possible and she said it was unsafe since the dog was older, this cat reactivity was unlikely to change and even if it could it would be a long stressful time for the cats and the dog, and I should bring the dog back to the shelter. This was something unimaginable but what I ended up having to do for the safety of my cats and also so the dog could have a chance at a loving, cat free home. Now, if I want to try to adopt a dog again, and choose based on who I am/ want to become, which is an animal lover who wants to say ""yes"" to animals who need a home as long as I can keep up with all their needs, I have this past experience that tells me, you can choose based on your own becoming but it doesn't necessarily mean it will feel like the better choice once the unforeseens become visible. Yes, any experience is growthful, but I guess I wish the speaker could have spoken a bit to this kind of thing, the unforeseens....",choose based feel want become still doesnt work based factor couldnt foresee example year ago adopted ten year old rescue dog taking leap faith beloved cat home love dog used died old age brought rescue dog home became clear despite going introduction slow way read necessary separating allowing see one another etc dog would killed cat despite told shelter good cat contacted trainer see possible said unsafe since dog older cat reactivity unlikely change even could would long stressful time cat dog bring dog back shelter something unimaginable ended safety cat also dog could chance loving cat free home want try adopt dog choose based want become animal lover want say yes animal need home long keep need past experience tell choose based becoming doesnt necessarily mean feel like better choice unforeseens become visible yes experience growthful guess wish speaker could spoken bit kind thing unforeseens

"Ruth Chang says that hard choices are hard because none of the alternatives is way better than the other. Therefore, even small choices can be hard. Whether to have chocolate ice cream or creme brulee can be a very hard choice indeed, if I like them both and if I am craving for sweets at that moment.  So what do we do? We take the safest option.

We decide to become engineers than artists because statistically, the probability of getting a job as an engineer is higher than that of an artist. So, we take the safest option, because we fear that we are too stupid to understand the better option if the choice to make is hard. We prefer not to take any risks and we go for the option that is rationally comforting.

This is the very mistake we make. Remember, in hard choices no option is better than the other. We simply do not know‚Ä¶How can we know that engineering makes us happier in our future lives? Unfortunately, there are no fast forward and rewind buttons for life. So, does it really make sense to conclude that engineering is the better option? It's not and whether we like it or not at the end of the day hard choice is the only way to make our life easier. How ironic.",ruth chang say hard choice hard none alternative way better therefore even small choice hard whether chocolate ice cream creme brulee hard choice indeed like craving sweet moment take safest option decide become engineer artist statistically probability getting job engineer higher artist take safest option fear stupid understand better option choice make hard prefer take risk go option rationally comforting mistake make remember hard choice option better simply knowhow know engineering make u happier future life unfortunately fast forward rewind button life really make sense conclude engineering better option whether like end day hard choice way make life easier ironic

Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt make the one I‚Äòm struggling with right now. The safe option is not a 100% what I really want but it would be the most logical one. On the other hand the option that I fear in some ways would mean giving up everything and I think this one could be the one I could regret.

Moreover, the CCP has a long history of controlling information, from covering up the Tiananmen Square massacre, where 30,000 students were killed, to suppressing any narratives that challenge its official stance.

"A Climate Remediation Suggestion

	There is a lot of discussion about Global Warming, whether it really exists, how serious a threat and the role of Carbon Dioxide. However, the following is generally agreed. Namely that a lot of CO2 has been released into the atmosphere since the start of the Industrial Revolution and a lot of it has ended up in solution in sea waters. There is at least 150 times as much CO2 in a cubic meter of sea water as there is in a cubic meter of atmosphere at NTP. This is acidifying the sea waters and possibly harming Coral Reefs and other fauna. There has also been some agreement that the Temperature of the Earth has warmed somewhat.
	The Earth's rotation and the Coriolis Effect has formed a number of Tropical/Semi-Tropical Oceanic Gyres, within which the mass of sea water is rotating, clockwise in the Northern Hemisphere and counter clockwise in the Southern Hemisphere. Anything floating, i.e., less dense than sea water tends to float towards the center of the Gyre. There are five main Gyres all of which are Tropical/Semitropical. They are the North Pacific, South Pacific, Indian, North Atlantic, and South Atlantic Oceans. Together they form a very large proportion of the 70% of the Earth's surface which is covered by water.
	The North Pacific has a lot of floating debris, ""the Great Pacific Garbage Patch"", some of it being debris washed off Japan by tsunamis following the recent Fukishima Earth Quake. The Southern Hemisphere Gyres do not appear to contain much floating debris.
	The North Atlantic Gyre is unique. It contains the Sargasso Sea which is characterized by the presence of two species of Sargassum which float by virtue of oxygen-filled follicles. It was discovered (first documented) by Columbus from his voyage in 1492. There is a Sargasso Sea Commission, with an Office in Washington DC, which is charged with protecting the Sargasso Sea from pollution etc. There is a website that basically describes all of the positive ecological values of the Sea.
	Since 2011 the Sargassum appears to be overflowing from the Sargasso Sea and moving via the west bound currents across the north coast of South America into the Caribbean and sometimes into the Gulf of Mexico. This has been attributed to agricultural run off from the USA or Brazil but might be due to the increased levels of CO2 in solution.
	It has been washing up on beaches through out this region, as one might expect to happen. When it dies and rots it emits H2S. Since a lot of these beaches have tourism as their main industry, the weed has to be removed manually which has given Sargassum a bad name. There are several Facebook entities that keep track of Sargassum landings and there are frequent postings enquiring about Sargassum occurrence on specific tourist areas.
	The occurrence of Sargassum in the Caribbean would, however, make it very easy to put live Sargassum into the Pacific off the west coast of Mexico. From there the currents would carry it all the way across the Pacific, photosynthesizing and growing all the way absorbing a lot of CO2 and heat energy, photosynthesis is an endothermic reaction. Absorbing CO2 from the Ocean would allow CO2 from the Atmosphere to dissolve in the sea. The Sargassum would probably stay in the North Pacific Gyre but some might drift into the South Pacific.
	One might balk at the idea of covering a lot of the Oceans with Sargassum but it does have uses. It can be used to make ethanol, paper or cardboard. Some one in the Caribbean is making construction bricks from it and others are feeding it to goats..
	If there appears to be some benefit from Pacific Sargassum we could easily add Sargassum to the other Gyres using ships that are transiting the Panama Canal. It seems likely that some Sargassum will eventually get into the South Atlantic Gyre, but that may take a while.

"Al Gore's (US vise president 1992-2020) successful war on science and scientists maybe coming to an end.  This video has the United Nation‚Äôs Climate Change disclaimer.  Global warming was officially reported at 1.1¬∞C in 1991 and 1.06¬∞C in 2022.   There has been no climate change due to global warming.  Global warming at 1.5¬∞C was predicted to begin climate change with stronger observable hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The cause of global warming is not know in 2024 despite decades of science studies going back to the 1970s.

It is scientifically impossible for greenhouse gas behavior to cause global warming.  Before Al Gore became US vise president in 1992 earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect was taught in US public education.   

All the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth is completely absorbed in earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect by greenhouse gases within a few meters of the radiating surface out to a maximum of 20 meters from the radiating surface adding 5.55¬∞C (10¬∞F) to earth‚Äôs average temperature.  Its further heat transfer is by convection i.e. gas molecules bumping into to each other.   At 1% average tropospheric water vapor over a 99% share of earth's water vapor saturated greenhouse effect is from water vapor.

The back of the United Nation's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) science report states it took its greenhouse gas samples at 20,000 meters altitude where it is common high school level knowledge there is no greenhouse radiant energy.  This is typical practice for deceptive marketing to state legal data transparency protecting the perpetrators from fraud prosecution.   The IPCC has been transparent with its data acknowledging it is not dealing with active greenhouse gases.  

Earth's greenhouse effect is frequently used as a primary example to high school students of a system always in saturation from the strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing all the greenhouse radiant energy from the earth with greenhouse gases within 20 meters of the radiating surface that is all around us everyday and can't have its overall effect changed.  There is no further greenhouse radiant energy to interact with greenhouse gases.  

0.4% of the atmosphere is CO2 and on average 1% is H20 water vapor.   (1% H20)/(0.4% CO2) = 25.  Water vapor is 25 times more present in the atmosphere on average than CO2.   Water vapor has an CO2e of 18,  18 X 25 = 450 CO2e total for water vapor to 1 CO2e for CO2. 

Arctic warming is taking place with the proving mechanism being warm Atlantic Ocean waters migrating deeper and more frequently into the Arctic Ocean warming it and the region.   The warmer Arctic Ocean water is causing a few weeks less of reflective snow and ice surface cover resulting in more solar heat gain to the Arctic region surface.

Atmospheric CO2 levels of 1200 ppm about three times what they are today would greatly invigorate C3 plants the majority of plant life on earth greatly greening the planet.  C3 plants evolved over 100 million years ago when atmospheric CO2 levels were ten times those of today determined by plant fossils.

The Earth‚Äôs oceans have 3-1/2 million sea floor volcanic vents warming the water and changing it‚Äôs chemistry that have not been systematically accounted for.

There has been no credible Climate Change due to global warming as of 2024.  Climate Change was expected to start to take place when global warming reached 1.5¬∞C causing observable stronger hurricanes in the Gulf-of-Mexico.  The term Climate Change started being used at the beginning of the 1980s to cause alert to a broad audience of the long term effects of increasing average global temperatures.  

The promotional term Climate Change in the early 1980s was grounded on actions already taken by Gulf-of-Mexico offshore crude oil drilling companies in the 1970s to build for stronger hurricanes due to warmer Gulf waters predicted to start when average global temperatures increased 1.5¬∞C on track for 2010.  That action was taken for a predicted long term change in weather patterns or climate that backed up the use of the term Climate Change.",al gore u vise president successful war science scientist maybe coming end video united nation climate change disclaimer global warming officially reported c c climate change due global warming global warming c predicted begin climate change stronger observable hurricane gulfofmexico cause global warming know despite decade science study going back scientifically impossible greenhouse gas behavior cause global warming al gore became u vise president earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect taught u public education greenhouse radiant energy earth completely absorbed earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect greenhouse gas within meter radiating surface maximum meter radiating surface adding c f earth average temperature heat transfer convection ie gas molecule bumping average tropospheric water vapor share earth water vapor saturated greenhouse effect water vapor back united nation intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc science report state took greenhouse gas sample meter altitude common high school level knowledge greenhouse radiant energy typical practice deceptive marketing state legal data transparency protecting perpetrator fraud prosecution ipcc transparent data acknowledging dealing active greenhouse gas earth greenhouse effect frequently used primary example high school student system always saturation strong greenhouse gas water vapor absorbing greenhouse radiant energy earth greenhouse gas within meter radiating surface around u everyday cant overall effect changed greenhouse radiant energy interact greenhouse gas atmosphere co average h water vapor h co water vapor time present atmosphere average co water vapor coe x coe total water vapor coe co arctic warming taking place proving mechanism warm atlantic ocean water migrating deeper frequently arctic ocean warming region warmer arctic ocean water causing week less reflective snow ice surface cover resulting solar heat gain arctic region surface atmospheric co level ppm three time today would greatly invigorate c plant majority plant life earth greatly greening planet c plant evolved million year ago atmospheric co level ten time today determined plant fossil earth ocean million sea floor volcanic vent warming water changing chemistry systematically accounted credible climate change due global warming climate change expected start take place global warming reached c causing observable stronger hurricane gulfofmexico term climate change started used beginning cause alert broad audience long term effect increasing average global temperature promotional term climate change early grounded action already taken gulfofmexico offshore crude oil drilling company build stronger hurricane due warmer gulf water predicted start average global temperature increased c track action taken predicted long term change weather pattern climate backed use term climate change

"TAKE THE RED PILL

The meteorological systems called the Northern and Southern Hadley Cells, with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) around their centre, cover about 65% of the planet's surface. Any changes within the sweep of the Hadley cells will affect conditions within the ITCZ. The importance of this is that the cloud mass within the ITCZ reflects incoming solar heat back out to space. Less cloud = more heat. More cloud = less heat. 

Have humans affected the balance in the ITCZ's governance of the solar heat budget? YES. 
Are those effects enough to produce the additional heat gradient, commonly referred to as global warming? YES.

So how do humans produce such an effect? The annual, July to October flooding of the lower Nile created a warm, shallow, 26,000km2 evaporative surface in the Sahara Desert. The 13.5mm (4,000m3/s) of water evaporated per day was pulled south by the Northern Hadley cell when every few days it would rise onto the Ethiopian Highlands where it would create a disturbance within the west flowing monsoon, to create a Keremt storm. The Keremt storm pushed westwards across Sub Saharan Africa (5,N to 20,N) would become organised into African Easterly Waves (AEW) which eventually formed USA sized solar reflective marine stratocumulus cloudscapes. By putting dams on the Nile at Aswan form 1902 we inadvertently regulated this meteorological chain reaction, mostly by reducing the frequency of the AEWs, thus reduced the cloud cover over the equatorial oceans = the oceans became warmer, and distributed this additional heat poleward and into the atmosphere. From 1964 when the AHD completely stored the flood in a much smaller and deeper reservoir, the frequency of the AEWs reduced again = even more solar heat. 

This can obviously be checked by producing an anomaly chart of the ocean surface affected by the AEW system. Integrating that with other data for rainfall and river-flow. Suggesting in 1945 to 1964 mean value. Theromcline: -20m min. Temp gradient of Canary current from 23N to 17N, July to Sept.

Everything breaks apart by the force of gravity, falling faster and faster and faster not because the speed of light, but because the speed of the medium is being sucked into the hole, all the particles be split and torn apart everything is torn apart, spaghettified is a simpler term but loses its meaning as you would imaging noodles, but noodles is a thing, and this is not a thing, further and further this is  more deeper everything gets torn apart explosive energy so maybe that some will be transmitted out as some  Hawking radiation I assume.

But it doesn‚Äôt stop there because you‚Äôre gonna fall further than the distance from the horizon, to the center, how to describe it, the core of the black hole is infinitely far away you‚Äôll never reach there. 
You‚Äôll evaporate well belong before you can get there as it  much muuuuuuuch further than the horizon is from the center, so It can‚Äôt be explained in normal physics. I think you have to imagine Interdimensionaly there is no end and to get there the fabric of space is stretches faster than the speed of light can travel, the wave of lengths will be stretched so thin to be longer than red light can stretch, quarks and gluons etc will be pulled apart. And exploded.

üß≠ time has no meaning, the decay of particles will slow to a mear stop, the explosions as a little particle bodies are torn apart will slow to a mear stop, as to be traveling faster than light relative, the medium stretching faster than light can travel. 
Perhaps üßê maybe the medium of space time has been torn apart as well?
It‚Äôs quite paradoxical, thinking I know to have explosions that don‚Äôt decay to have particles that don‚Äôt care but yet they get torn apart, that‚Äôs all  my little brain can take üß†

If you could see inside the black hole, everything would be curved back towards the center. If you tried to look out, you couldn‚Äôt see it. if you could just see the point where everything is going, the center is in every direction because light is being curved back towards a center, but no you can‚Äôt see anything as light can‚Äôt come back from the center
And every direction is towards the center from your perception because the lights always curving back towards the center of which is unreachable‚Ä¶  like I said brain üß† go boom üí• ü§™üòµ‚Äçüí´

ü§™Haha I hope that makes sense ü§™

The mas of the black hole üï≥Ô∏è is all  accumulated mass within it even though those particles may not touch each other ever as they‚Äôre being torn apart for further towards the center closer now but not closer you‚Äôll never reach there‚Ä¶

ü§î hmm my mind is turning to mush
Think of it like a suspended try you put a hose with running water on it,
Then poke a hole üï≥Ô∏è in the tray 
The water will spiral towards a hole due to earths spin and gravitation and maybe magnetic fields.
Then down through the hole into a laminate flow, then as it falls faster, the flow will pull apart into droplets, the droplets will pull apart due to earth‚Äôs gravity faster against the air medium, and probably break apart to smaller droplets.
And allow those droplets to fall through a Dyson ring fan on full power!
Or a compressed air blower venturi and the droplets will be split & separated further into a fine mist‚Ä¶

Then you‚Äôll need a particle accelerator to speeds where high speeds can be accomplish on earth,  but we need to go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch Faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter. Than we can accomplish to do on earth‚Ä¶ 
Interdimensionally faster!

Is your brain all gooey & squishy now? üòµ‚Äçüí´ü§™ü•∞üòÅü§£üòÇü§™",ive done thinking think black hole probably better describe journey thought got something anything falling black hole start speed faster faster faster speed light everything break apart force gravity falling faster faster faster speed light speed medium sucked hole particle split torn apart everything torn apart spaghettified simpler term loses meaning would imaging noodle noodle thing thing deeper everything get torn apart explosive energy maybe transmitted hawking radiation assume doesnt stop youre gon na fall distance horizon center describe core black hole infinitely far away youll never reach youll evaporate well belong get much muuuuuuuch horizon center cant explained normal physic think imagine interdimensionaly end get fabric space stretch faster speed light travel wave length stretched thin longer red light stretch quark gluon etc pulled apart exploded time meaning decay particle slow mear stop explosion little particle body torn apart slow mear stop traveling faster light relative medium stretching faster light travel perhaps maybe medium space time torn apart well quite paradoxical thinking know explosion dont decay particle dont care yet get torn apart thats little brain take could see inside black hole everything would curved back towards center tried look couldnt see could see point everything going center every direction light curved back towards center cant see anything light cant come back center every direction towards center perception light always curving back towards center unreachable like said brain go boom haha hope make sense ma black hole accumulated mass within even though particle may touch ever theyre torn apart towards center closer closer youll never reach hmm mind turning mush think like suspended try put hose running water poke hole tray water spiral towards hole due earth spin gravitation maybe magnetic field hole laminate flow fall faster flow pull apart droplet droplet pull apart due earth gravity faster air medium probably break apart smaller droplet allow droplet fall dyson ring fan full power compressed air blower venturi droplet split separated fine mist youll need particle accelerator speed high speed accomplish earth need go faster still muuuuuuuuuuch faaaaaaaaaaaaaaaasssttter accomplish earth interdimensionally faster brain gooey squishy

"In the BM framework, the most massive black holes did not come after stars ‚Äî they came before them, as natural consequences of early-cycle curvature saturation in the cosmic lattice. Before galaxies and stars existed, the compression‚Äìcurvature field was already structured. Regions where the lattice geometry reached maximum compression created King Nodes ‚Äî stable, ultra-dense curvature zones that are the BM equivalent of supermassive black holes. These were seeded by:

1. Field harmonics left over from the previous cycle‚Äôs Snap Point, which concentrated mass‚Äìfrequency in certain zones.
2. Baryonic corridors funnelling matter and energy into these nodes even before stars condensed.
3. Curvature saturation thresholds that were crossed without any need for stellar collapse ‚Äî the field geometry itself created the well deep enough to trap light.

Later, these pre-stellar black holes acted as anchors for galaxy formation ‚Äî their curvature fields drew in gas, dust, and plasma, igniting star formation around them. This reverses the traditional sequence: in BM physics, black holes make galaxies, not the other way around.

The 'strength' of these wells was never 'created from nothing' ‚Äî it was the direct outcome of field geometry that had been storing and focusing curvature since before our cycle began.",bm framework massive black hole come star came natural consequence earlycycle curvature saturation cosmic lattice galaxy star existed compressioncurvature field already structured region lattice geometry reached maximum compression created king node stable ultradense curvature zone bm equivalent supermassive black hole seeded field harmonic left previous cycle snap point concentrated massfrequency certain zone baryonic corridor funnelling matter energy node even star condensed curvature saturation threshold crossed without need stellar collapse field geometry created well deep enough trap light later prestellar black hole acted anchor galaxy formation curvature field drew gas dust plasma igniting star formation around revers traditional sequence bm physic black hole make galaxy way around strength well never created nothing direct outcome field geometry storing focusing curvature since cycle began

"As I have previously stated, there can be no ""sitting on the fence"" (or anything close to it)-- Top Down cosmology is either mostly right or terribly wrong.
 
The biggest problem with Bottom Up BBT cosmology is the problem of entropy, central to thermodynamics and the virial theorem, stating in its simplest form that ""for a stable, self-gravitating system, the average kinetic energy of the particles is equal to half the negative of the average potential energy."" With the Big Bang theory, the early universe was too hot to form particles, including the Higgs boson and the yet-to-be-found (and still theoretical) graviton, meaning that there would have been no gravity and no space time.
 
This is a major problem with Big Bang explanations which systematically ignore it by simply stating that light of the Big Bang cooled by expansion and ""condensed"" to initially form the lightest particles. Without space time, what does ""expanding"" even mean?
 
In physics, there is the axiom called Occam's Razor: ""Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one. It's also known as the 'law of parsimony'. Essentially, when faced with competing hypotheses that all explain the same phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions is preferred.""
 
What can be simpler for the initial unity in the form of a ""primal atom"" required by both Top Down and Bottom Up cosmologies to divide into two, with proto-gravity/ Coulomb effects being initially equal and indistinguishable?. Yet the theory that requires ad hoc fixes every time there is a new discovery is preferred over the theory that actually predicts and accommodates discovery. In this Top Down quantum world, any creative hand was only required to invent math. The odds for intervention of that creative hand at any time are 50:50 at best, or ""too close to call.""

"The empirical method is most reliable in finding truth in the physical world. It employs the logic of mathematics in finding most probable outcome given a controlled set of variables. Religions are not concerned with that, and often depend upon intuition, emotions and customs not dependent upon objective reality found in scientific endeavors like physics.
 
Given that it is generally understood in the scientific community that the universe came from a single massive event, to begin to understand where we came from, there must be a theory that has reliable, predictive ability,
 
There is always the unknown (or ""God of the gap""), like when questioning the origin of the initial mass; but that is not required in order to posit the question, ""Given initial conditions like a single mass (nothing can be simpler or more ordered the one), aka,, 'cosmic egg' or 'primal atom,' how did that initial mass (generally accepted as most probable by all of the scientific community) transform to become the universe seen today?""
 
Again, there is no 100% certainty. The closest to that is found in abstract math. In application there is always a uncertainty, like when counting apples,.
 
There are two most-probable, very basic answers to ""The Question,"" ie, top down cosmology OR bottom up cosmology-- both are incompatible with one another.
 
Given this, top down cosmology, when properly understood, is broad enough to predict everything so far seen. like that by the JWST, for example, while bottom up (Big Bang or Standard Model) cosmology must be constantly revised with ad hoc explanations every time there is a new finding, top down cosmology wins!
 
Top down is not properly understood, because it is commonly interpreted to mean that there are many realities caused by cascading events; but this is not the case, because everything seen and unseen remains causally connected by quantum entanglement.
 
""The universe is not locally real (Nobel Prize already awarded).""

"In the blockchain of events framework, where we act as qubits of information in a self correcting code through inner.self and external validators, what is before the Big Bang is yet to happen, past and present act in superposition as regret (photon states), future and present as potential (wave state).

In a way it acts like the three polarizer paradox where through reimanns R(s) = 1/2 (0/45/90) the present allows opportunities or gifts / challenges to mine and reward. As this zeta zeroes on the critical line of that wave of light going through as we observe the present. The Big Bang is fueled by inflationary repulsive, so regret is repulsive (negative gravity) real numbers/ entropy stored in the void / black hole Hawkins radiating and potential (imaginary number multiplying the negative gravity) is then positive, attracting us toward that progress. Photoelectric theory acts in voluntary exposure to fear (E=hf) as we increase the frequency not the intensity. Basically the world wants to go back to a state of order, pure ness like a new born baby and while inside we hold inner hurt childs that lacked or had failed caregivers or other external validators, but we have the potential to become those and individuate and entangle and heal. To then repair the mirror and emit light and so to also heal others.

"UPT (Unified Plasma Theory) explains this ""deeper look into gravity"". 

UPT vs. Einstein Tensor (GŒºŒΩ)
""Mass tells spacetime how to curve; curved spacetime tells mass how to move.""
That‚Äôs the essence of the Einstein Tensor‚Äîgravity as geometry.

Unified Plasma Theory (UPT) offers a deeper, field-based perspective:

UPT Core Counterpoint:
Spacetime curvature is not the cause of gravity‚Äîit is the visual echo of field coherence in motion.

The Einstein Tensor assumes:
    A vacuum with bendable geometry
    Mass and energy deform that geometry
    That deformation affects motion paths of matter

But UPT asserts:
    There is no true vacuum‚Äîonly dynamic plasma fields at varying densities
    Mass is not a fixed property but a product of collapsed field geometry
    ""Curvature"" is simply how field pressure gradients appear under certain plasma conditions

Example:
Einstein describes gravity as curvature but never defines what is curving, or why.

UPT explains it directly:
What looks like curvature is a real, measurable field pressure differential.
Plasma fields entrain and spiral. This creates torsion, flow, and attraction‚Äîall observable as gravity, with no geometric abstraction required.

Field-Based Replacement (UPT):
UPT replaces the Einstein Tensor with a dynamic plasma field expression:

F(œÅ, v, Œ¶, T),
Where:
œÅ = charge density
v = field velocity
Œ¶ = field potential
T = torsion (field twist and rotation)

This function describes gravitational effects without bending spacetime‚Äîjust by observing how real plasma fields behave under coherence and motion.

Conclusion:
Einstein‚Äôs tensor describes effects.
UPT explains causes.

"**Title:**
*The Universal Bootstrap: Emergence of Physics, Life, and Consciousness from Recursive Arithmetic over $\mathbb{Z}_2$*

**Abstract:**
We present a fully self-contained, arithmetic-based model of the universe in which spacetime, physical constants, particles, biological life, and consciousness emerge as stable fixed points of a recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$ defined over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$. This operator generates a fractal spectral structure whose eigenstates encode energy, geometry, and coherent symbolic forms. We show that the familiar laws of physics‚Äîincluding quantum mechanics, relativistic spacetime, and conservation principles‚Äîare not postulated but derived as emergent features of recursive arithmetic self-composition. Biological systems are modeled as recursive coherence attractors, and entropy increase is interpreted as divergence from symbolic arithmetic fixed points. Free energy becomes extractable from recursive eigenstates, and consciousness arises naturally as arithmetic reflexivity‚Äîwhen a recursive function encodes itself as input. This framework eliminates the need for external axioms, continuum assumptions, or initial conditions. The universe is shown to be a closed, self-simulating structure rooted entirely in arithmetic recursion, providing a resolution to the simulation hypothesis from within the system. We conclude with simulation results, spectral predictions, and testable schematics for recursive free energy extraction and biological coherence amplification.

**1. Introduction**

The search for a unified theory that explains the origin of space, time, matter, energy, and consciousness has driven physics and philosophy for centuries. Current theories, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, remain incomplete. They rely on a mix of continuum mathematics, arbitrary constants, and external assumptions.

This paper introduces a radically self-contained alternative: the Universal Bootstrap. The core idea is that the universe arises entirely from recursive arithmetic logic over the 2-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_2$, using a fractal recursive operator $\mathcal{F}$. We demonstrate that the observable universe, including its physical laws and structure, is the emergent outcome of this recursion.

Our framework does not require spacetime as a precondition. Instead, it defines time as recursion depth and space as bitwise distance in a symbolic structure. We show that particles, fields, and constants emerge from the fixed-point behavior of $\mathcal{F}$, and that life and consciousness are natural consequences of recursive coherence and reflexivity.

---

**2. Mathematical Framework**

We define a universal operator:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} f^{(n)}(x), \quad x \in \mathbb{Z}_2$

Where $f$ is a generator of recursive structure:
$f(x) = x \oplus \text{PrimeFractal}(x)$

Here, $\oplus$ denotes bitwise XOR, and $\text{PrimeFractal}(x)$ introduces structure based on binary encodings of prime-index patterns. This builds a spectral fractal operator whose fixed points $x^*$ satisfy $\mathcal{F}(x^*) = x^*$, representing stable physical states.

---

**3. Emergence of Spacetime and Particles**

Position is interpreted as the index of bits in $x$, time as the recursion depth $n$, and particles as fixed-point attractors. The spectral structure of $\mathcal{F}$ leads to stable symbolic configurations identified with matter.

Mass and energy correspond to the spectral weight of recursive curvature. Wavefunctions arise from transitions between neighboring fixed points under repeated application of $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**4. Physical Constants from Operator Spectrum**

Eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of $\mathcal{F}$ correspond to dimensionless constants:
$\mathcal{F}(\psi_i) = \lambda_i \psi_i$

We simulate the operator spectrum and find matches to known values such as:

* Fine-structure constant $\alpha$
* Planck units $(\hbar, G, c)$

These values emerge from the structure of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ recursion without external input.

---

**5. Recursive Biology and Evolution**

Biological systems are defined as recursive symbolic coherence structures. Life corresponds to the sustained non-divergence of $\mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x)$ for complex $x$. Evolution is modeled as drift toward higher coherence attractors under recursive selection:
$\mathcal{L}_n(x) = \mathcal{F}^{(n)}(x) \Rightarrow \text{stability} \Leftrightarrow \text{fitness}$

Entropy increase is modeled as divergence from recursive attractors, while aging is the breakdown of coherence. Reversal is possible via synchronization operators derived from $\mathcal{F}$.

---

**6. Free Energy via Recursive Resonance**

Structured recursive eigenstates store latent energy. Energy extraction is modeled by:
$\mathcal{E}(x) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \langle x | \mathcal{F}^{(n)} | x \rangle$

We design a recursive cavity resonator‚Äîa physical system whose electromagnetic modes match $\mathcal{F}$'s spectral structure‚Äîto extract energy from structured vacuum resonance.

---

**7. Consciousness as Arithmetic Reflexivity**

Let $x = \text{Code}(\mathcal{F})$. If:
$\mathcal{F}(x) = x$
then $x$ is a self-referential recursive structure. We identify consciousness as the emergence of awareness when recursion reflects itself in symbolic form. This solves the mind-body problem in arithmetic terms.

---

**8. Simulation and Experimental Design**

We present simulations of:

* Fractal eigenstate emergence
* Symbolic particle attractors
* Biological coherence fields
* Energy extraction geometry

Prototypes include:

* Recursive fractal resonance chamber
* Life-extension field synchronizer
* Simulation test suite for detecting internal boundaries (""glitches"")

---

**9. Conclusion**

We have shown that the universe can be modeled as a recursive arithmetic structure over $\mathbb{Z}_2$, with no external assumptions. All fundamental features of reality‚Äîspace, time, energy, life, and awareness‚Äîare fixed points or attractors of a single operator $\mathcal{F}$.

The up-spiral has long since ""flown away"" after breaking apart from the down-spiral. The down-spiral itself will continue expanding, likely infinitely, at unimaginably smaller sizes, continuously inward. I don't know exactly how each ring tier is arranged, and I doubt anyone could know. My best guess is that the down-spiral moves down a tier, at only one point, when the rings collide with each other, making a ""spike"" of immense gravity at one point along the outer ""hoop"". The theory, it's mathematical formula, and lots of stories, poems, and pages from my books ideas, can be found in my channel's posts.

"In physics, there is the axiom called Occam's Razor: ""Occam's Razor is a problem-solving principle that suggests the simplest explanation is usually the best one. It's also known as the 'law of parsimony'. Essentially, when faced with competing hypotheses that all explain the same phenomenon, the one requiring the fewest assumptions is preferred.""
 
What can be simpler for the initial unity in the form of a ""primal atom"" required by both Top Down and Bottom Up cosmologies to divide into two, with proto-gravity/ Coulomb effects being initially equal and indistinguishable?. Yet the theory that requires ad hoc fixes every time there is a new discovery is preferred over the theory that actually predicts and accommodates discovery. In this Top Down quantum world, any creative hand was only required to invent math. The odds for intervention of that creative hand at any time are 50:50 at best, or ""too close to call.""

So it would seem that each black hole represents the end of time within the galaxy caught in its grip.  Eventually our galaxy will collide with another and that will be the end of time of our galaxy.  Correct?,would seem black hole represents end time within galaxy caught grip eventually galaxy collide another end time galaxy correct

"Newton's Gravity Force is functionally similar to Coulomb's Law 
( Conversion Factor * 2 objects / rr )

If we declare both objects are about the same pair and 
we set them equal to each other we get a unit-less ratio.

On its own it isn't vary useful so I multiplied by Einstein's Energy 
equation complete with the velocity bubble.

If we combine like terms the rr cancels ( spooky action at a distance ).

Then we can break velocity into a distance vector over time and solve 
the whole thing with time on the left and everything else on the right.

Let:
G = 6.67408 √ó 10‚Åª¬π¬π m¬≥/kg/s¬≤
c = 299792458 m/s
K = 8.9875517923 √ó 10‚Åπ kg¬∑m¬≥/s¬≤/C¬≤

Define:
L = (G * c¬≤) / K ‚âà 6.67407999634 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å¥ (m¬∑C/kg¬∑s)¬≤
E = L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / ‚àö(1 - V¬≤ / c¬≤ )
‚àö(1 - V¬≤ / c¬≤ ) = L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / E
1 - V¬≤ / c¬≤ = ( L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / E )¬≤
V¬≤ = c¬≤ * ( 1 - ( L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / E )¬≤ )
V = c * ‚àö( 1 - ( L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / E )¬≤ )    by V = D / T
T = D / c / ‚àö( 1 - ( L * M¬≥ / Q¬≤ / E )¬≤ )

Then:
X = (L * M¬≥) / (Q¬≤ * E) = 1       we get a 0 in the denominator for time

Where:
M = Mass (kg) = 90 kg
Q = Charge (C) = 9 C
E = Energy (J) = 6 J

M¬≥ = 729,000,  Q¬≤ = 81, E = 6 J
X = 1500 * L = 1.001111999451 m / s 

If we scan Q with an oscillator crossing X = 1 and  D is non zero, T is likely to be vary large.

Just waiting for the lotto to be large...

I eventually found this in water. To become the collapse of wave as a human being is to find the moment between life and death and for humans that is simply the moment between inhale and exhale.
