"My best interpretation of the talk:

You have to decide what values are more important for you, what you are going to value. You create value in the process of making such choices. Think of a baby/kid that makes certain choices about hobbies, food. He/she creates reasons in the process of making a choice. We will not tell our kid that he/she should do the hobby/study that best fits his/her values, we will motivate him/her to make a choice and see that choice as a step in becoming a person. Same for adults. So it's not so much about discovering reasons/which are the best reasons but rather creating reasons. in making a choice, you rather create reasons (or value) than passively discover and follow existing reasons (related to values). When reason tells you that both options are equally valuable, accept that both options are fine, use your intuition or feeling to decide which is really ok (or flip a coin if you want, whatever you want), and stop thinking about discovering reasons but focus on valuing/being attached to your choice.

does this make sense?",best interpretation talk decide value important going value create value process making choice think babykid make certain choice hobby food heshe creates reason process making choice tell kid heshe hobbystudy best fit hisher value motivate himher make choice see choice step becoming person adult much discovering reasonswhich best reason rather creating reason making choice rather create reason value passively discover follow existing reason related value reason tell option equally valuable accept option fine use intuition feeling decide really ok flip coin want whatever want stop thinking discovering reason focus valuingbeing attached choice make sense

I thought this was brilliant. The premise as I took it is that decisions should be based on personal values and be more about the kind of person you want to become vs. an optimal solution. The problem I still have is what if you have to juxoppose two mutually exclusive values when you want to embody both. That is difficult but then again this is where she is talking about having to define yourself one way or the other.,thought brilliant premise took decision based personal value kind person want become v optimal solution problem still juxoppose two mutually exclusive value want embody difficult talking define one way

"It's not that there is no best choice among multiple options; it‚Äôs that we are incapable of ever knowing which choice it is. 

Perhaps God does.

The stumbling block for us is our belief that we can ever know which was which. All that we can know is whether our choice worked out well for us or not. But we can never know it was the better or worse choice.

Like in the parable of the Chinese farmer and his son. Wherein every day something happens to the farmer and his son and every day his neighbors come and pronounce judgment on the event. ""Too Bad,‚Äù they say one day about one event. Then,  ‚ÄúHow lucky you are,"" the next day about a different event. After each pronouncement the farmer ambivalently replies, ‚ÄúWe'll see."" With each new day revealing the neighbors' judgments, no matter what they were, were wrong.",best choice among multiple option incapable ever knowing choice perhaps god stumbling block u belief ever know know whether choice worked well u never know better worse choice like parable chinese farmer son wherein every day something happens farmer son every day neighbor come pronounce judgment event bad say one day one event lucky next day different event pronouncement farmer ambivalently reply well see new day revealing neighbor judgment matter wrong

"Interesting approach. I can't agree, however. I feel like the message is to just make up whatever you want in order to justify a hard choice. This might be okay for a choice that affects only you, but do we want to empower our leaders to operate this way. I don't. Choices that are hard are not incomparable.  They are hard because there are either competing objectives at play, uncertainty in the consequences or outcomes of each possible alternative, or a struggle between the trade-offs that would result from the choice. You can compare them using multiple objective analyses which are designed to address this very difficulty of bringing competing values into the decision. While there may not be a ""best"" choice in a traditional sense, there most certainly is an ""optimal"" choice if you work hard at defining all of the different fundamental objectives underlying the decision as step 1 (even and especially those objectives that compete with one another) rather than just calling the decision hard and leaving it at that.  Being an artist might be better on life fulfillment and worse on financial stability, but how we value life fulfillment in comparison to financial stability and our risk tolerance come into play to help show that one choice really is optimal over another, depending on how these values are held by the decision-maker.",interesting approach cant agree however feel like message make whatever want order justify hard choice might okay choice affect want empower leader operate way dont choice hard incomparable hard either competing objective play uncertainty consequence outcome possible alternative struggle tradeoff would result choice compare using multiple objective analysis designed address difficulty bringing competing value decision may best choice traditional sense certainly optimal choice work hard defining different fundamental objective underlying decision step even especially objective compete one another rather calling decision hard leaving artist might better life fulfillment worse financial stability value life fulfillment comparison financial stability risk tolerance come play help show one choice really optimal another depending value held decisionmaker

Also, I think about her life with big mercy. Like, what will she do after me, could she get married(because of some old memories)? On the other hand, I sometimes feel bad about her personal attitude as she fights a lot and makes things big. Therefore, I think getting married to her can be a disaster.

this is so accurate i mean she was right about using science in making decisions by draw a line between 2 of them and choose one because it gives better option or it's more safe to do that way isn't the best way  to make good decision it is just depend  on us who we are giving out the best reasons to choose it,accurate mean right using science making decision draw line choose one give better option safe way isnt best way make good decision depend u giving best reason choose

"What if you choose based on who you feel you are/ want to become, and it still doesn't work out, based on factors you couldn't foresee: an example, a few years ago I adopted a ten year old rescue dog, it was taking a leap of faith because I have 5 beloved cats at home (but love dogs and used to have them until they died of old age) -- I brought the rescue dog home and it became clear, despite going about the introductions in as slow a way as I had read was necessary/ separating them but allowing them to see one another etc., the dog would have killed my cats (despite being told at the shelter he was good with cats). I contacted a trainer to see what was possible and she said it was unsafe since the dog was older, this cat reactivity was unlikely to change and even if it could it would be a long stressful time for the cats and the dog, and I should bring the dog back to the shelter. This was something unimaginable but what I ended up having to do for the safety of my cats and also so the dog could have a chance at a loving, cat free home. Now, if I want to try to adopt a dog again, and choose based on who I am/ want to become, which is an animal lover who wants to say ""yes"" to animals who need a home as long as I can keep up with all their needs, I have this past experience that tells me, you can choose based on your own becoming but it doesn't necessarily mean it will feel like the better choice once the unforeseens become visible. Yes, any experience is growthful, but I guess I wish the speaker could have spoken a bit to this kind of thing, the unforeseens....",choose based feel want become still doesnt work based factor couldnt foresee example year ago adopted ten year old rescue dog taking leap faith beloved cat home love dog used died old age brought rescue dog home became clear despite going introduction slow way read necessary separating allowing see one another etc dog would killed cat despite told shelter good cat contacted trainer see possible said unsafe since dog older cat reactivity unlikely change even could would long stressful time cat dog bring dog back shelter something unimaginable ended safety cat also dog could chance loving cat free home want try adopt dog choose based want become animal lover want say yes animal need home long keep need past experience tell choose based becoming doesnt necessarily mean feel like better choice unforeseens become visible yes experience growthful guess wish speaker could spoken bit kind thing unforeseens

"Ruth Chang says that hard choices are hard because none of the alternatives is way better than the other. Therefore, even small choices can be hard. Whether to have chocolate ice cream or creme brulee can be a very hard choice indeed, if I like them both and if I am craving for sweets at that moment.  So what do we do? We take the safest option.

We decide to become engineers than artists because statistically, the probability of getting a job as an engineer is higher than that of an artist. So, we take the safest option, because we fear that we are too stupid to understand the better option if the choice to make is hard. We prefer not to take any risks and we go for the option that is rationally comforting.

This is the very mistake we make. Remember, in hard choices no option is better than the other. We simply do not know‚Ä¶How can we know that engineering makes us happier in our future lives? Unfortunately, there are no fast forward and rewind buttons for life. So, does it really make sense to conclude that engineering is the better option? It's not and whether we like it or not at the end of the day hard choice is the only way to make our life easier. How ironic.",ruth chang say hard choice hard none alternative way better therefore even small choice hard whether chocolate ice cream creme brulee hard choice indeed like craving sweet moment take safest option decide become engineer artist statistically probability getting job engineer higher artist take safest option fear stupid understand better option choice make hard prefer take risk go option rationally comforting mistake make remember hard choice option better simply knowhow know engineering make u happier future life unfortunately fast forward rewind button life really make sense conclude engineering better option whether like end day hard choice way make life easier ironic

Unfortunately I still can‚Äôt make the one I‚Äòm struggling with right now. The safe option is not a 100% what I really want but it would be the most logical one.

"Summary: Hard choices are those where neither alternative is better overall, hence difficult to choose between. A choice may be hard but at the same time unimportant, like choosing food from menu. Also, for important hard choices, the outcome is often unknown, which makes them harder.

Don't have naive scientific attitude and try to put choices on a linear scale of good and bad. Complex numbers and entanglement are just few examples of incomparable or unquantifiable things in science. Just imagine how hard life must be.

The thing is- there is no rationally good or bad alternative in hard choices. If everything could be rationalized, then we would be reduced to automaton. In other words, instead of being episodes of agony, hard choices are opportunity for us to express our consciousness, and be the person we are.",summary hard choice neither alternative better overall hence difficult choose choice may hard time unimportant like choosing food menu also important hard choice outcome often unknown make harder dont naive scientific attitude try put choice linear scale good bad complex number entanglement example incomparable unquantifiable thing science imagine hard life must thing rationally good bad alternative hard choice everything could rationalized would reduced automaton word instead episode agony hard choice opportunity u express consciousness person

The core of what she was saying is good, but I feel like it was kind of diluted with things that actually detracted from the point. Someone in the comments said, ""Just make a choice, then make so that it turns out to be a good one"". I understand why they came to this conclusion based on this video. I think that people like this would have clearer understandings had the video beed a lot more direct. I'm gonna break it down in my own words and it might help people.


For me, the important part is when she mentioned ""Drifters"". A drifter is someone who's aimless and subsequently doesn't no who they are. To understand who you are, it's important to be able to recognize meaning. (Look up ""Jordan Peterson Meaning"") Defining yourself, your goals, your principles, allows you to recognize the choices that yield the most meaning from the consequences of your decisions.


That's it. I don't think this adds to what she said, it might make her point clearer though. idk. Also, keep in mind that Jordan Peterson is politically controversial, but has a great life philosophy and I'd encourage anyone to look him up as he's very important to this. I like a lot of what she had to say, ""If your life were nothing but easy choices, you'd be a slave to your decisions.""

"....And yet, when it comes to making a hard choice, my options are a subset of socially constrained options. So long as feel that I exercised my will in choosing from a limited set of viable options can I claim I am expressing the authentic me. The individual who allows life to guide their choices is a drifter, they make decisions passively and therefore allow themselves to be swept up by the flow of life. The principle of Wu Wei would apply here. However, those who from their inner self make a choice are more resilient to being pushed around by the flow of life, they resist certain ideas and support others. In this sense their lives are meaningful because they engaged their agency in support some cause or idea.  They dictate to the world who they are and make life into what they want by self-created reasons. 


Where those reasons originate from is unimportant..... At what point did I decide to decide? I can certainly get behind the idea of making decisions that 'feel right' because that feeling is how I 'know' I've acted in accordance with a deeper part of me.  I've expressed myself in a way that reflects my inner feelings. How I arrived at those feelings is an unknown mystery but that doesn't matter so long as I have allowed their expression to be released. It's as if the outside world flows through me and I through it and when I have a sense that I want to move or act I do and in that act I am being authentic to who I really am. Which is a creature that is interconnected with its environment. I am my ecology. So to act in a way the expresses my inner feelings is to allow the flow of life to pass through me unimpeded. The same way water flows down a mountain. 


I am not certain but pretty confident there is no right way to act. Which is to say there is also no wrong way to act. You just do, and there it is. We can layer on complex mental games but these are also simply manifestations of what there is.

Acknowledge they are hard because there is no best alternative. They are blessings; easy choices are passively detrimental.

Do realize scientific knowledge (what is) is different that values (ought to be)
Do realize science can delineate what is more, less or equal.  But ""oughts"" don't function the same way, these decision are on par with each other. . 
Do use normative powers - the power to create reasons - to have you make a decision that you can put yourself behind.  

Don't think one choice is better than the other, 
Don't forgo normative powers and become a drifter (let others give you reasons)
Don't overly sweat a pro and con list (one choice isn't better than the other)

Summary: Choose what you ought or want to become.  Create the compelling reasons for you choice.  Don't fall back on seocial pressure or personal fears.  

Question: - Its not always simple to have the right compass on what we want to become.  I'd argue the reason decisions can be so difficult is becuase we aren't sure what we want to be, even for her she couldn't decide between lawyer and philospher.",according dont realize scientific knowledge different value ought realize science delineate less equal oughts dont function way decision par use normative power power create reason make decision put behind dont think one choice better dont forgo normative power become drifter let others give reason dont overly sweat pro con list one choice isnt better summary choose ought want become create compelling reason choice dont fall back seocial pressure personal fear question always simple right compass want become id argue reason decision difficult becuase arent sure want even couldnt decide lawyer philospher

"Well as for me Options and hard choices can sometimes route NOT ON SOMEONES PERCEPTION OF NOT BEING EQUALLY GOOD BUT OUR SOCIETIES PERCEPTION OF WHICH ONE IS BETTER.
For example when choosing a dress eventhough you perceive both of your dress as beautiful and worth-wearing, you still have a hard time in chosing so you ask which one is better. 
True that in the end you're the one who will make the decision for yourself ""look inside"" ""who am i to be? "" but in the end We dont really know the ones which are good for us so we ask advice from PEOPLE who matters to us, the ones we loved. 

You see as an Asian being ""Practical"" routes to our family decissions and YOUR OWN PERSONALITY clashing in between them WILL make it hard for you. So you see, Even if My mindset say BOTH CHOICES I MAKE IS EQUALLY GOOD, SOCIETY will still Slap me on the face,my family, my friends, MY own fear, WILL MAKE IT HARD FOR ME TO ACCOMMODATE OR PERCEIVE EACH ONE OF my CHOICES AS BOTH GOOD. And Because EVERYONE WILL SAY that when choosing ""CHOOSE WHICH ONE IS BETTER"" SO IN THE END It will lead me think that choosing between finance and art, FINANCE is better as a job than being a graphical artist. The sector of succes really routes on their perception of success,MONEY AND INCOME. So for us to NOT make a mistake we chose to simply lead with the safe option in order for us to survive.",well option hard choice sometimes route someone perception equally good society perception one better example choosing dress eventhough perceive dress beautiful worthwearing still hard time chosing ask one better true end youre one make decision look inside end dont really know one good u ask advice people matter u one loved see asian practical route family decissions personality clashing make hard see even mindset say choice make equally good society still slap facemy family friend fear make hard accommodate perceive one choice good everyone say choosing choose one better end lead think choosing finance art finance better job graphical artist sector succes really route perception successmoney income u make mistake chose simply lead safe option order u survive

"One of the best little TED Talks in existence.  A hard choice doesn't have to be a BIG choice.  Once we learn to handle the small hard choices, the big choices seem less intractable.  Hard choices aren't hard because we are stupid, they are hard because we pay a lot of attention to the voice in our heads that tell us what we SHOULD choose.  Fear of the unknown pushes us to choose what we believe is the less risky option - usually not the best choice, in the end.  We assume that values are the same as scientific measurements (x is better, worse or equal to Y), they aren't.  So we have to create reasons to choose one or the other based on a range of values. Don't let the world decide for you, reflect on what you can put your agency behind. Hard choices make us fundamentally who we are.  Here's where I stand, ""I commit to chocolate donuts!""",one best little ted talk existence hard choice doesnt big choice learn handle small hard choice big choice seem less intractable hard choice arent hard stupid hard pay lot attention voice head tell u choose fear unknown push u choose believe less risky option usually best choice end assume value scientific measurement x better worse equal arent create reason choose one based range value dont let world decide reflect put agency behind hard choice make u fundamentally here stand commit chocolate donut

"In order to decide what to do based on who you want to be (as this woman is suggesting), you have to first have some idea of what you value. This is the big problem. Many of us have a conflict of values. Do we decide based on the values of our parents? our religion? our best friend? our favorite rebel or celebrity? our favorite internet guru? a combination? If you are facing a tough decision, my advice to you is find out what YOUR values are, what matters most to YOU, and ignore everyone else's. And don't be ashamed of your values. Don't let anyone guilt trip you into caring more about something they value. For example, if you know inside your heart that personal freedom matters more to you than family, you should not have kids, no matter how much other people want you to. It will be a big mistake. If someday you change your mind and your values, then fine, become a parent, but only then. If you truly care more about creativity than financial security, choose a career that involves that over one that doesn't. If you have a choice (and some don't), then it's got to be your choice.",order decide based want woman suggesting first idea value big problem many u conflict value decide based value parent religion best friend favorite rebel celebrity favorite internet guru combination facing tough decision advice find value matter ignore everyone elses dont ashamed value dont let anyone guilt trip caring something value example know inside heart personal freedom matter family kid matter much people want big mistake someday change mind value fine become parent truly care creativity financial security choose career involves one doesnt choice dont got choice

"My perplexity about this talk deals with finding a concrete solution to the problem. The speaker figured out in a very brilliant way what the problem is about, where the fundamental issue lies, but at the end of her speech I didn't feel like I got a new way to face hard choices.
I agree with the idea that there's no way to apply quantitative comparisons to values and so we can't say that an option is better than another. I also agree with the consideration that hard choices are chances to shape ourselves as we want to be in our life.
But, in my opinion, the real problem is here: what is the best choice if I want to be like THAT?
So many times we know what we want from life, but we can't figure out the best path to get to it. I can listen to myself, to the emotional part of me, to understand what I really want from life, what I desire, so I know how I want to shape myself, but I don't know what tools I have to choose to obtain this shape.",perplexity talk deal finding concrete solution problem speaker figured brilliant way problem fundamental issue lie end speech didnt feel like got new way face hard choice agree idea there way apply quantitative comparison value cant say option better another also agree consideration hard choice chance shape want life opinion real problem best choice want like many time know want life cant figure best path get listen emotional part understand really want life desire know want shape dont know tool choose obtain shape

"I don't necessarily agree. It's always best to make decisions based on as much research as possible - this helps us see the choices for as much as they actually are. She's making out most life decisions are on a par - which they are not. For example, I love art and I love maths. I love art a bit more.

I don't ""see myself"" as a banker, at all, but ultimately, it's the better choice for me as I'll be OK financially.

I find it notoriously difficult to make choices (paralysis by analysis), but one thing that helped me to become better was:

- Research, find the answers then make the decision (let it make itself)

DON'T

- Make the decision based on feelings and then find the answers to justify it

"""Hard choices give us the power to create reasons for ourselves?"" Her assumption is flawed in 2 ways.
(1) By saying above, she is assuming that in making so call ""easy"" choices, everyone will make the same choice. We all know it is not true.
(2) Greater flaw in her logic is that, based on her definition of ""hard"" choices, every choice we make is a ""Hard"" choice because every choice we make, there is underlying values and preferences. Even so called ""drifter"" she mentioned, made a ¬†choice to let their environment influenced their choice and reasons can be made to justify anything we do.

The worst Ted talk I have watched ever.",hard choice give u power create reason assumption flawed way saying assuming making call easy choice everyone make choice know true greater flaw logic based definition hard choice every choice make hard choice every choice make underlying value preference even called drifter mentioned made choice let environment influenced choice reason made justify anything real waste time watching worst ted talk watched ever

"here is a way to view this: you have a choice to make between becoming a banker and an artist. the way i see one should make a choice is not what any of these alternatives offer, but what you would expect from a choice. in this case, what you would expect from a job. maybe you would expect to be active and work with children. that qualifies you as a kindergarten teacher. all in all, what i am saying is that you should not look at the first alternatives when making a choice, but know what you want from making that choice and look somewhere else in case you are not satisfied",way view choice make becoming banker artist way see one make choice alternative offer would expect choice case would expect job maybe would expect active work child qualifies kindergarten teacher saying look first alternative making choice know want making choice look somewhere else case satisfied

"I like her argument, but I want to make a small correction.


In the second to the end leg of the speech she said that the world of science is different from the world of value. That people want to quantify the value of choice A numerically, and it simply doesn't work that way.


I think everything is numerically quantifiable, but a scientific approach is not always the most efficient. I really do believe if you spent enough time you could make the right choice scientifically, using all the information at your disposal. This would take waay too long and you're better off just 'feeling' what's best for you.


Her last point was 'making reasons'. She said that hard choices allow you the opportunity to recreate yourself in your decision. This is an excellent thought, probably more important than the choice itself is your own perseverance in it. More often than not I've failed in a decision and reverted to the alternative, not because the alternative was better but simply because I reevaluated at the first hardship. After all alternatives were exhausted and I was on the last good choice, I realized that each choice would have been equally hard and equally rewarding, stumbling on the decision did nothing but waste time.",like argument want make small correction second end leg speech said world science different world value people want quantify value choice numerically simply doesnt work way think everything numerically quantifiable scientific approach always efficient really believe spent enough time could make right choice scientifically using information disposal would take waay long youre better feeling whats best last point making reason said hard choice allow opportunity recreate decision excellent thought probably important choice perseverance often ive failed decision reverted alternative alternative better simply reevaluated first hardship alternative exhausted last good choice realized choice would equally hard equally rewarding stumbling decision nothing waste time

"There are two things that bothered me here. The first is the somewhat offhand distinction she makes between ""is"" and ""ought,"" which does nothing to advance her argument. Second, her talk practically labels those who do not have a developed sense of self as weak individuals with no sense of will to create the kind of person they must become. Some people just don't know, either because of interest in a broad variety of things or because of choice paralysis brought on by emotional and psychological abuse. She acts like it is the fault of the decision maker for not being able to determine how they wish to structure their lives.
